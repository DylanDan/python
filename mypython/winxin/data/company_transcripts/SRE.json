Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Analysts", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website.", "Here in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 9, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks for joining us this morning. And I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, and not whoever that other company was that that operator put on. Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who were unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website.", "I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on project already under contract, and our Infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess that for additional increases after Cameron's three trains come online.", "And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And four, we expect to capture opportunities over the next five years to add to or extend our earnings growth.", "Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to slide five. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks a lot, Debbie. First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on the settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties. We continue to expect that the settlement or something in a substantially similar form will be approved. Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular Cameron's Trains 1 through 3 in the marine pipeline.", "We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed five new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatt, 70 megawatt of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium-ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts, as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emission.", "IEnova expects to complete three natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents a combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project you recall is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar denominated contract with CFE.", "Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples. IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial steel company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the off-taker is a private company. We anticipate there'll more opportunities like this.", "The Pima Solar facility is expected to cost roughly $115 million and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we at Sempra leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in the U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico.", "We also made CPUC filings for additional projects representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include an expansion of SoCalGas' Master Meter program for Mobile Home Parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its Customer Information System.", "Now, please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share.", "You'll also recall that we adopted the new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016, and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period.", "Now, let's turn to slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our result. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E in South America; $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities, this is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC file decision, these earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016; plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions, and higher AFUDC earnings. Also improving earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at Parent.", "These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefits in 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation. And at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects, primarily from current quarter losses. If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some inter-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure.", "You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings, but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currency's movement (08:50). You'll find additional details on FX in the appendix.", "And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comment and start to take any additional questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Hi.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hey, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Couple of questions. So first on the cost of capital settlement, could you maybe just let us know if there's any additional color you have on why the delay in approving it, and if you don't have any additional color, when do you expect to get some color?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I'm going to have Steve Davis talk a little bit about that. But just to remind everyone, this is an all-party settlement. There were no comments filed against the settlement during the proceeding. The settlement included both ORA and a major consumer group in the state, TURN, as well as the three utilities as part of that. And we have been having meetings, ex parte meetings with Commissioner with all of those five parties present in those meetings to reinforce the settlement. And so, we had a meeting last night. We have more scheduled today, and I will turn it over to Steve to add any more color.", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. I would just add that we continue to believe the settlement or something substantially similar will be approved by the Commission in a timely basis. And we will continue to have further discussions with parties this week and we're hopeful of having a timely decision.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Did they give any indication on why this delay occurred?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "There has been no real indication, but what I will say from my 30 \u2013 almost 40 years of experience is that when you have new Commissioners coming in for a major decision for the first time on that, oftentimes they want to take a little bit more time until they understand the issues. And that it's usually the assigned Commissioner would allow for that to happen. So, we're not reading anything more into it that there's like any major concern. And we're not getting indications of major concerns in the meetings that we had so far.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, just \u2013 sorry, I have to ask this every call, but just is the Cameron project still on the same timeline as you said at the Analyst Day?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I mean, ourselves and our partners and our contractors are committed to that timeline. I mean, I asked Joe to talk about some of the processes that we have in place to monitor the project and try to stay on top of it with our partners and our contractors because Joe has been personally involved with those. He also talked to the CEO of CB&I earlier this week. So, Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. Yeah. Debbie mentioned, I did speak with Phil Asherman over the weekend in preparation for this call, as I normally do now. And there is no change in the dates that they gave us and we gave you last fall. And I think it's important to emphasize what Debbie did, the commitment of each of our partners, and as you know, our customers, to get the project finished and into operation is completely there. We have joint venture board meetings regularly. We're all going to go out and see the sites next month when we have our meeting. And everybody is engaged in getting this important project done.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And just any other update on the partner issue?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Go ahead, Joe.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. There's really no update from what I gave at the Analyst Day. I continue to believe and I'm confident that we'll find a common path here to a solution, but as I mentioned, it's complex, and we have to negotiate all these things, and it requires unanimous consent as I mentioned. So, I don't have a particular date of when we're going to get it done, but it's clearly one of my priorities, and I'm focused on it, and I'm actively working on it with my team and with the partners.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin of UBS. Your line is open.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "So, quick first question here, more focused on the quarter than anything else. Can you elaborate a little bit more on \u2013 I think the gas marketing was the \u2013 what you guys talked about in the deck. What was the source of that $26 million higher earnings a little bit, and how should we think about that on a go-forward basis?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I mean, that \u2013 we always have given you indications of kind of information on how gas prices affect our business and we have that information in the appendix. Part of what you're looking at is the change of gas prices year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, but I'll have Jeff take you through that, and in particular to have you understand kind of what we think is going to happen for the remainder of the year. So, Jeff?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Good afternoon, Julien. On the $26 million improvement, roughly $15 million of that is from mark-to-market losses in the quarter last year. And as Debbie indicated, obviously, the natural gas prices have improved just over $1. I would also mention that at the end of this year you'll think about the ENI contract will be rolling off. And I think if I was to guide you in terms of how we think about the year, this segment we showed you at the analyst conference would report roughly $40 million to $50 million of negative results for the year, and we still think that's the best way to think about it.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Excellent. Can you elaborate any further successes? I know we're just a few weeks out in terms of the Peruvian bid or anything like that, and also in terms of Mexico on the marketing effort, those \u2013 both seems somewhat tangible (15:35)?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. As you say, it's only been 30 days out, Julien, but in that 30 days, we did announce a new solar project in Mexico. And we \u2013 if we think to answer the Mexico question first, is there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there. A lot of bids will be going out for additional renewable resources to meet the standards that have been set by Mexico.", "And then, what's significant about the Pima project is it's one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial and industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also on Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business, and don't have anything specific to announce in that area.", "But we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquid side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal and so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us.", "On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that, but what I will tell you is that it looks like that that project will go out for bid and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid turns will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities.", "And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so, we have had some meetings with the government officials, encouraging them to create a bid that ensures that the project is going to be financeable, and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured.", "Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything more to that?", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. The only thing I would add, Julien, as you know, we talked a little bit about this at the analyst conference, and we obviously know a lot about the project. And as Debbie had mentioned, we are having discussions with the government. And to the extent that it fits our risk profile, we'll take another look at it and we expect something to happen either later this year or the first part of next year.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Excellent. Sorry, going back to the first question real quickly, Jeff, did I hear you right saying something about a contract rolling off? How does that impact the sensitivity, just really quickly to clarify?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "I think that you'll recall that the \u2013 ENI was one of the original contracting parties at Cameron, and that contract is rolling off within the year. And what we're really basically saying is, next year, you will not have the benefit of that contract.", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "And, Julien, that's the regas contract.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Right.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I mean, this has been part of what we've told you all along that we want to remind you that that \u2013 because we start \u2013 I mean, it's a good thing \u2013 because we start the testing of the first train in the beginning of next year, we cannot have export going on at the same time as import. And so, that contract has to stop so that we can begin the testing of the trains for the export. And that impacts us financially later this year, and the beginning of next year, always have been incorporated into our base plans.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. But that reduces the sensitivity, just to be clear, the gas sensitivity?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Not really. It's \u2013 I mean, it's probably about a $5 million benefit this year and zero next year.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. All right. Sorry to belabor it. Thank you, all.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. It's a \u2013 if your question is, does that reduces sensitivity to gas prices, no, because it's really not dependent upon gas prices. The gas price sensitivity is really tied to the ECA plant and attained good (19:55) contract at the ECA plant, plus any gas in storage and have volatility during the course of the year.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, great. That's what I thought. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Okay.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One quick one just on the utilities, the Mobile Home Meter and the CIS projects. Those were not included in your base CapEx, but they were included in I think your upside scenarios, what's \u2013 can you kind of just walk us through what's changed in the last four or five weeks?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Sure. We've actually made our filing on the CIS project for SDG&E and about $250 million project. So, now we're beginning the regulatory process on that and that happened since the analyst conference. And then, do you want to talk a bit about the Master Meter, because there are some differences between the two utilities and how that moves forward?", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "Sure, Debbie. Hi, Michael. As I had mentioned at the analyst conference and that looking at some of the incremental capital opportunities, they were both highlighted and we talked about quarter two filings of which we made a filing on the 28th and then one just on Friday for the Master Meter project. So, both are in alignment with what our plan is. The CapEx associated with the SDG&E Customer Information System is about $250 million and that the gas company for the Mobile Home Park, it's about a $270 million capital project. So, both are solid projects and we look forward to timely approval of those going forward.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "When do you think spend \u2013 how long do you think the regulatory approval process will likely be, and when do you think the capital \u2013 and what's the timeline for the capital to actually occur or actually be spend?", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "Well, the good news is we've had two very successful pilot projects at both SDG&E and the gas company. So, the Commission is very well aware of our track record, and so we think we will get a timely decision likely in into 2018 and we would begin immediately after the approval.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And, Joe, I want to come back a little bit to the Cameron project. And I know you talked with Phil from CBI, but also note that in their earnings call yesterday, one of Phil's colleagues, Patrick Mullen, used the comment when asked about Cameron LNG and the start-up, and I'll quote, \"We expect the phased start-up of these three trains starting in the latter half of next year\". That may have just been kind of bundling of Train 1 and Train 2 with one supposed to be mid-year and one supposed to be at the end of the year, or you could interpret that as, hey, everything is moving a little bit more again. Would love your thoughts if any.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Joe, why don't you go ahead and...", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I obviously read that as well and I think you can read it a number of different ways. I think what he was saying wasn't different from what my discussion with Phil was because I've been in a number of conversations with Pat and I think they believe that they are in the schedule that they gave us. So, I think he was just commenting altogether, he basically said all the trains are moving toward getting into operation in the second part of the year, which is very consistent with what we said.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, Joe. Much appreciated.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Sure.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Hi. How are you doing? So, a lot of my questions have been answered, but just a few quick ones. So, I was wondering how the Australian LNG curtailment potential might impact you guys. What kind of opportunities you guys might see or just in general what it means for the market? So, that was my first question.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I'm going to have Joe go through it in more details, but what I will say is that we've been saying all along that we saw a market opportunity in the 2021 to 2023 period. And I think now the kind of the herd mentality is where we've been all along.", "And that's why we've moved forward. We're trying to get Port Arthur in the marketing stage where we are right now. And while we're trying to get the issues with Cameron Train 4 resolved so that we can get into the market for that. And I think what you're seeing is what we have been predicting all along as if there was going to be a demand need in the market come that kind of timeframe, and that's why we've continued to work on development of our projects.", "Joe, do you want to talk about the Australian curtailments?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Sure. Hi, Paul. I guess I would say it this way, I think that the long-term users of LNG both in Asia and Europe are looking for long-term solutions and reliability. And so they want to make sure that they're going to a source where they can see that over a long term.", "And I can say that the meetings that we had together with Woodside where we were jointly marketing the Port Arthur facility went very well and there's quite a lot of interest in that facility. And I think that what's going on in Australia it just shows that not necessarily getting these things done means that always that that's going to be available or available for a longer period of time.", "So, I'm not sure it's going to have an immediate effect, but it starts to show that the end users are seriously starting to contemplate the need to go FID pretty soon, if not this year, next year or into the next year so that they can make sure that they meet the needs that they have, and don't get in trouble if something like that were to become more serious. And so, I think that having Woodside along with us has been very good for the project and for us. So, we look forward to trying to get these things signed up.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So, it's been positive for the most part, and \u2013 but you don't actually see any sort of near-term potential opportunities that are going to be developed (26:42) if I'm understanding what you guys are saying, is that right?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "I would like to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about near-term development projects in Australia or here?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "No. No. I mean, with you guys. I mean, if you're having curtailments, that would suggest that people might have concerns about \u2013 first of all, what does it mean for just LNG sales in the near term in the market, what does it mean in terms of tightening up the market perhaps in Asia?", "And then secondly, does it make \u2013 and it sounds like you were saying that it does, does it make people more interested in something like Port Arthur or are there opportunities that you guys are exploring in terms of getting supply that may not be as \u2013 I'm sorry, that may not have as much risk perhaps associated with it as something like we're seeing in Australia?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I mean, we have talked to you all about what we saw as the advantages of the U.S. project, over these projects with dedicated supply sources because of the supply it dries up or that there's a problem of getting that supply to market. And in the U.S. market, you don't have one dedicated supply source for the gas.", "And you also have the ability to sell off the gas at liquid points in the U.S. if you don't want to take the gas. I actually think that what's happening in Australia and in some of these other locations where the supply source starts to get more constrained makes it way better for the U.S. in terms of marketing our projects.", "And so that's the opportunity that we see right now. And I think Woodside's seen the similar view, they've been very excited about our Port Arthur project from the beginning. And I think, being an Australian company, they see the benefit of that as well.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, great. And then the second question I have is that we're seeing \u2013 there was an announcement last \u2013 yesterday on some immigration enforcement by the DOJ with respect to another LNG facility. And we've also been hearing in other industries potential issues with immigration raising construction prices, delaying in-service dates and stuff. And I was just wondering \u2013 or at least the risk that's being perceived to that, I'm just wondering if that \u2013 is it all an issue that you guys are thinking about in terms of just as a cost and scheduling with LNG.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I'm going to have Joe \u2013 because we just read the news report and we checked into it. It's not our project and we have controls in our project that should allow us not to have this kind of a situation occur. Joe, do you have any...", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. So, I think as she just said, we saw this article this morning and didn't \u2013 we haven't heard that, so that didn't sound like it was us.", "I checked. It wasn't us, it wasn't CC JV, and it wasn't their contractors, and we have controls in place around that. Also, you heard on the call yesterday, Phil mentioned that they were employing a great number of people, and they have a huge roster of people that they go to to bring people onsite. And they haven't really had problems bringing people onto the site.", "So, I think their controls are very sound, and we haven't seen this problem. Obviously, one of the reasons that we hired this consortium of contractors to work on this project was they have a large resource of people to go to, to bring to the site, and very much though in Louisiana.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I didn't mean to suggest it was your facility. I guess what I...", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "There was a comment that if a news article that it was.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Oh there was? Okay, I'm sorry.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, there was. Yeah. That's why we had it checked right before the call. So...", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Yeah, I checked as well. But just an \u2013 and FYI, though, I guess, just a \u2013 sort of a derivative to that is \u2013 and I don't mean to belabor this, but are you seeing any issue with any of your projects, LNG or otherwise with respect to this issue of \u2013 we're hearing this from the building sector, et cetera, that like they're having significant concerns about access to labor due in part to limitations on immigration and more immigration enforcement. Have you heard of anything? Was that \u2013 is that something that's coming up in terms of costs or anything that you're hearing about in general in the market?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "We have not, actually, Paul, and we do talk about this when we meet with the contractors. And they seem to have ready access to labor and have not brought this up as an issue.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes the time that we have for questions at this point. I would now turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, thanks again, for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact our IR team. Have a great day.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2016 financial presentation. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With me in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and CEO; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 4, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive a proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached a multiparty settlement agreement, we continue to believe the most likely GRC outcome is one consistent with the settlement. We also believe we have made a strong showing to support our historical treatment of tax repair allowance benefits.", "Therefore, today, we are updating our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance and providing you with our long-term growth rate, assuming a GRC outcome consistent with the settlement. We think the best approach is to postpone our Analyst Conference until we have a final GRC decision. We are tentatively looking at the month of July in New York City as a possible date for the conference. Once we received a PD, we will confirm the date and location.", "In our other businesses, we recently announced the sale of Southeast utilities and our interest in REX. We expect to receive about $760 million of cash proceeds to invest in projects that align better with our growth strategy. As you know, our strategy is to provide growth that is roughly twice that of the utility average but with a commensurate risk profile. I will discuss these transactions later on the call.", "Our updated 2016 adjusted guidance range is now $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects approximately $60 million of reduced earnings from REX. The sale of our Southeast utilities does not affect current or future earnings. These earnings reduced from the sale can largely be offset by lower interest costs.", "Looking forward, we are well positioned for strong growth over the next five years. We expect our base plan to provide earnings in 2020 at $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted compound annual growth rate for 2016 to 2020 is about 12%.", "Prior to the sale of REX, the comparable growth rate would have been about 11%. Joe will address the growth rate further in his remarks, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have significant credit capacity in the latter years of our plan which will provide us with flexibility in capital allocation. We will discuss our plan assumptions, business unit projections and growth strategy in more depth once we reschedule the Analyst Conference.", "Turning to our financial results, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $370 million. As a reminder, until we receive a final GRC, we are recording revenues based upon 2015 authorized amount. Once we receive the final decision, we will report the impact of the 2016 authorized margins back to January 1. If the GRC had been finalized by January 1 and was consistent with the settlement agreement, utility first quarter earnings would have been in line with last year despite the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC.", "Now, please turn to slide 5. There are several updates related to Aliso Canyon. First, SoCalGas is cooperating with DOGGR and the CPUC on the root cause investigation through their contractor, Blade Energy Partners. We expect the investigation to take about six months to nine months with the results be issued by the agencies late this year or early next year.", "Second, we are working to get the field back in service for injection. Consistent with DOGGR's proposed safety review, we have implemented a plan to prioritize and test wells, with the goal to have the facility in service by the end of this summer.", "Third, we are working with state and local agencies to address electric reliability concerns. Aliso Canyon currently has about 15 Bcf of gas available for withdrawal. When deciding how best to use that gas, reliability for both the summer and winter seasons must be considered.", "Fourth, we are completing our estimate of the total amount of gas lost from the leak and formulating a plan to mitigate that amount. Fifth, the temporary relocation program has been extended to allow the county to complete in-home testing, with results expected this month. SoCalGas and public agencies have conducted numerous tests of outdoor air quality. Results continue to confirm that air quality in Porter Ranch is at normal level. Finally, we are addressing the litigation that has been filed related to the leak.", "With regards to costs, we have incurred additional amounts, primarily from continuation of the temporary relocation program, as ordered by the court. The court has scheduled a follow-up hearing on June 7. Based on an expectation that the relocation program continues through June 7, we estimate the costs for amounts paid and forecast to be paid at approximately $665 million. We have recorded an insurance receivable of $660 million. Our cost estimate does not include certain potential items as described on the slide. Please refer to our 2015 10-K and first quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on costs and our insurance.", "Now, let's turn to slide 6 for an update on our other businesses. Sempra constantly looks at our assets to determine whether they fit with our long-term contracted infrastructure model and whether they integrate with other assets to offer strong long-term growth prospects. We identified three assets that are no longer a strategic fit for us: REX, our Southeast utilities and the TdM power plant in Mexico. For the first two, we have announced sales agreements, and for TdM, we are conducting a sales process. For REX, we expect the sale of our equity interest to close in the second quarter and to provide $440 million in proceeds. The sale also allows us to forego expected future contributions for capital investment and debt repayments. We believe our capital can be better utilized to further enhance our strong growth outlook.", "As a result of the sale, we forecast a reduction for partial year 2016 earnings of approximately $60 million, which is included in our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. It is important to note that had we held our interest in REX, we expected 2020 earnings to be immaterial and dilute our growth, largely due to loss of earnings from west-to-east contracts that expire in 2019.", "In addition, we plan to permanently release uncontracted capacity held by Sempra. The negative earnings impact of this capacity release is projected to be between $100 million and $120 million and will be recorded in the second quarter. This amount reflects the acceleration of estimated losses that would have otherwise been realized over the remaining contract term. It is excluded from our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance.", "Moving to our Southeast utilities, we finalized the sales agreement last week and expect to receive $323 million in cash proceeds with the buyer to assume $67 million of debt. We did not see significant additional growth potential in our Southeast utility footprint and the earnings impact is projected to offset with reduced interest costs. Similar to REX, we expect to use the proceeds to invest in projects with strong growth prospects. Finally, TdM is the third asset that no longer fits with our long-term contracted infrastructure strategy. It is currently held for sale, and we are in the midst of a sales process.", "Now, please turn to slide 7. IEnova is building upon its position as the largest private energy company in Mexico to identify and originate new investment opportunities. IEnova is working on multiple development initiatives, including M&A, asset optimization, strategic partnerships with established companies and new companies seeking to enter the Mexican market, and emerging the opportunities in clean energy, storage, and liquids infrastructure.", "One example of asset optimization is the building of laterals of our gas pipeline network to interconnect with end users. Just this week, CFE awarded IEnova a contract to build a small lateral that connects our Sonora pipeline to a combined cycle power plant.", "In addition, the project opportunities identified by IEnova, the CFE bidding process for natural gas pipelines continues. We are currently evaluating two tenders with likely bid dates during the second quarter. In generation, we expect to see the second round of renewable energy auctions in August. And in electric transmission, we expect to see the first two bids under new rules of energy reform in 2016 and 2017. Each electric transmission project represents an estimated $1.2 billion of investment.", "With that, please turn to slide 8 and I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Debbie. Turning to our long-term financial projections, we expect that our base plan can provide 2020 earnings of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings CAGR from 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Some of our key plan assumptions include an $18.5 billion capital program including joint venture CapEx for Cameron trains 1 through 3, full-year earnings of $300 million to $350 million from Cameron trains 1 through 3 in both 2019 and 2020, a GRC outcome in line with our proposed settlement agreement and tax repair allowance benefits prior to 2016 being retained by shareholders and an optional $2 billion share repurchase.", "Under our base plan, annual adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by $1.7 billion over the plan period, raising our FFO to debt to roughly 22%. Including our targeted annual increase in the dividend of 8% to 9%, we project excess credit capacity in the later years of our plan to be between $2 billion and $4 billion. Leaving excess capacity on our balance sheet would not maximize shareholder value. We have used a conservative assumption of an optional $2 billion share repurchase, split between 2019 and 2020.", "While we do include this assumption, it is our intention to allocate capital toward high-value development projects. I will discuss all of our base plan assumptions and provide business unit guidance at our Analyst Conference. I want to remind you today that our plan is not aspirational in nature. It is anchored on expected utility performance and projects that are already contracted and operating or under construction. This approach gives us high visibility and conviction in our growth rate.", "On a final note, before turning to the quarterly results, I want to address the long-term earnings impact from the REX capacity release that Debbie discussed earlier. In the base plan we presented last year, we had only assumed about $5 million to $10 million of annual losses associated with this capacity for 2016 and 2017 because we had not factored in the financial distress that several counterparties have recently experienced. We had no capacity obligations in 2020. By permanently releasing the capacity now, our new five-year plan does not have to reflect any future losses from this capacity, nor any negative impact from the recently announced counterparty bankruptcies beyond the loss we expect to record in the second quarter.", "Now, please turn to slide 9. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $319 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported first quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude the $27 million after-tax loss on the pending sale of our equity interest in REX and $24 million of deferred Mexican income tax expense as a result of holding the TdM power plant for sale.", "In addition, just as a reminder, in 2016, we are now including LNG development expenses in our reported adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings guidance, whereas in 2015, these were excluded. There are several factors affecting the first quarter results that are either timing items, or items expected to reverse in later quarters.", "Please turn to slide 10 and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At our California utilities, we had $17 million of lower earnings mostly due to higher operating costs from higher depreciation and litigation with no increase in authorized margin due to the delay in our GRC.", "As Debbie noted, until we receive a final decision, we are recording revenues based on amounts authorized for 2015. Once we receive the final decision, we will record the cumulative impact of 2016 authorized revenues back to January 1. Including this retroactive benefit, we expect the utilities quarterly earnings would be roughly in line with last year which is important given the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC.", "Moving to the Parent category, we recorded $10 million of higher losses due to $7 million of lower repatriation tax expense that was more than offset by $10 million of higher net interest expense combined with a $5 million income tax benefit that was reported in the first quarter of 2015.", "At U.S. Gas & Power, we had $9 million of lower earnings due primarily to the impact of natural gas price movements on inventories that we sold forward. We expect this $9 million loss to reverse by year-end. At Sempra International, we had $8 million of lower earnings from foreign currency effects. This was due to a $4 million negative impact in South America and a $4 million higher positive impact in Mexico in Q1 2015. At SoCalGas, our Q1 2015 results included an $8 million GCIM award. No GCIM award was recorded in Q1 2016 as this reward was received in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Now, let's conclude on slide 11. In summary, we have updated our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.60 per share to $5 per share to reflect the REX sale. The annualized impact of the REX sale will also reduce earnings by approximately $70 million per year for the next few years.", "Our adjusted guidance is defined in further detail in the appendix. In terms of our financial results, while our first quarter earnings were impacted by the delay in our GRC, we will record the retroactive authorized margin back to January 1 once the final decision is received.", "Finally, assuming the GRC outcome is consistent with the settlement agreement, we project a base plan adjusted earnings CAGR of about 12% from 2016 to 2020.", "With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go first to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Julien. Hi, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Congrats.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Yeah. So, first quick question to get out of the way, what's the implied growth rate year-over-year on 2019 into 2020? You talked about share repurchases; I have been getting questions on it. Just wanted to settle that.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, what we've disclosed now is the growth rate through 2020, and we're not going to give any adjusted earnings guidance for 2019. We always give you the fifth year in our five-year plan. But I think you can kind of infer from what we've given you before and kind of the range of growth over that period of time. What I will say is as you know in our business that some of our growth tends to be lumpy because we have large projects coming into service, and then 2019 will be the first full year of Cameron trains 1 through 3 going into service. Those trains remain on schedule to be completed throughout 2018 as we've told you before. So, 2019, you'll see that come into 2019. And so, 2019 will be lumpy in comparison to 2018, and 2018 will be lumpy in compared to 2017 as the trains come in service.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, Julien, this is Joe. I'll just add on to that, exactly what Debbie said, but remember, the way we build our base plan, it will have utility growth ongoing from attrition and utility growth in South America, but there are no new projects that we have outlined that would come on service in 2019 and 2020. So, the growth, I think, you would see there or you would predict to see there won't be what we expect to have because we expect to have new projects. But we're talking about four years or five years from now.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And with that technicality out of the way, thinking holistically, what is the next focus, at least, of the company when it comes to that capital allocation? I appreciate you delineating the share repurchase as a placeholder. You are selling down some of the gas assets, deeming them non-core. Where is the company going? If you can at least describe your preliminary thinking. I know it's a little bit of an Analyst Day kind of question. But just thought I'd get it out there, especially in light of what should be nearer-term cash proceeds from the asset sales that you articulated already.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me talk to you about some of the things that we're looking at. And obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity right now in the space, there's a lot of opportunities. But we have a lot of organic growth as well. So let me talk about some of those things.", "First of all, we are still looking at train 4 being developed, and so that we would anticipate having agreements in place by the end of the year based upon conversations we've been having with the parties now. And that is not at all in our growth plan. So the numbers we gave you for 2020 has nothing for any additional LNG beyond trains 1 through 3. So we're still focused on that. We think it's a good growth opportunity for us. And then what we also think is the integrated asset. When you have such a huge demand for gas, the opportunity to develop pipelines and storage to serve those loads is a really great opportunity for us. So we continue to look at putting capital into those areas.", "I would also say that as you look at the opening of the energy markets in Mexico, they're at the infancy right now. They've only done some of the gas infrastructure. We have electric transmission, we have pipelines for liquids, we have pipelines for our terminals for liquid, we have a lot of more energy infrastructure to come out for opportunities in Mexico, and we think we just have wonderful foundation of assets there that allows us some opportunity.", "And then I would say our renewable business, we don't talk a lot about our renewable business, but we had a growing robust successful renewable business that we continue to have new projects that we find, and we have the ability to expand on some of our existing projects. What I would say is that we have a strategy that's really focused on growing at more than twice the rate or at twice the rate of the typical utility but with a similar risk profile.", "So, when we start looking at assets, we look at are they long-term contracted? Can they have low volatility because we know you all value low volatility with growth? And can they support our growing dividends? And can they give us the strength of the balance sheet that we're seeing over the five years of plan?", "And so projects that kind of fit that criteria, we're open to a lot of things. We constantly look at M&A, and we see some assets that may be on the market that might be of interest to us. So, our strategy hasn't changed and we just thought that the capital that we had in some of these things was kind of trapped and was not really integrated with anything else we had and was not going to provide us the kind of growth that other investments might.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And the last little piece there on the cash in hand today, I know it's part of the broader capital allocation, anything in particular there to emphasize?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Just the cash that you're getting from the asset sales.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Yeah, I'll let Joe...yeah.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I think, Julien, nothing particular. We're building out about $1 billion of renewables this year, and money is fungible. We're looking at all kinds of opportunities. Mark's groups are looking at lots of opportunities. So, I can't name one thing because there's a whole bunch of things on the plate.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Well, thank you, guys, very much. Good luck.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Julien.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Neel.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "I just wanted to touch on Mexico first, the three pipeline bids which IEnova got disqualified from. Could you explain the reasoning behind that and if there's any way to reverse the result or appeal it, and how that may affect the bidding going forward for you guys?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'm going to have Mark address that. And because I think it's important to know that it was not kind of \u2013 it didn't happen with as being disqualified one bid after the other. Unfortunately, we had to submit all bids kind of at the same time, and we didn't find out about being disqualified for the first one until the other two had already been submitted. But, Mark, would you talk a little bit about...", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yes.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", ".... of that really going forward and how we're dealing with that.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Right. Sure. I mean, on those particular bids, what \u2013 the methodology that we used was to adjust our tariff to CFE by additional capacity that we anticipated to sell to other customers down the road. But without specifying exactly where on the pipeline we would do that and that's the basis on which they would disqualify us. I mean, as Debbie said, we submitted three bids at once, used that same methodology. We're disqualified. We don't agree with it. And we've challenged it, but I think we've adjusted our bidding procedure going forward. And we've \u2013 frankly, it's kind of behind us now, and we're looking at the other bids. And we've adjusted how we're doing it. We would expect to be quite competitive in the future.", "So, it's not something \u2013 it was unfortunate just the way those bids came together, but it's behind us now, and we're moving on. But I will say that I think talking about Mexico in particular, we're still in a very, very good competitive position there and I'm really pleased with the growth that we've had. It's unfortunate you don't see it quite in the financials, but our EBITDA there was up 19% from $93 million last year to $110 million if you include our ownership in the JV and our proportionate share of their EBITDA. And it gets masked a little bit in the GAAP reporting and because of FX. Last quarter 2015 in the first quarter, we had a 3% inflation with \u2013 or a strengthening of the peso which actually reduced our tax expense. And in 2016, it was pretty much flat, and so we didn't get that same benefit. So, that kind of masked the underlying growth. But we had very strong growth there and are in a very good and competitive position in Mexico.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Got it. And, Debbie, you mentioned a lot of opportunities in Mexico beyond just the CFE pipelines. Could you maybe comment on, nearer-term, what maybe the best opportunities are that we should be looking at?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'll talk about some, and I think one that we have before us that we expect to close during the third quarter is the PEMEX acquisition of the JV assets that we currently hold jointly with PEMEX, and we're still moving forward on that. But as you probably read, now PEMEX is looking at other potential asset sales. And they have a number of assets that we would be interested in that will give us some opportunities. We're also looking at some of the other energy assets that are in Mexico now, some of which are in operations, some of which are in the development stage that we could potentially acquire and we have some that we're looking at there.", "And then just in terms of the broader markets opening, you have the bids coming out that are about $1.2 billion a piece for electric transmission that we're seeing. You have renewable being bid and several billion dollars worth of potential there. And then for us, since we kind of own and operate pipelines, there's a lot of liquid pipeline assets in Mexico. They are currently held by PEMEX now or needs for new liquids pipeline that deal with their opening of the oil market. And so we think that that's a great area for us as well to have similar type of long-term contracted infrastructure in liquids.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Got it. And my last question, with you guys divesting REX, there's no real domestic midstream presence. Are you looking to grow that through acquisition or organically or is that something that's not necessarily important as long as you have contracted growth in other areas?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. What we've looked at as a strategy to grow that but more on an integrated basis with our other assets. And that when you have a huge load like building an LNG facility, that gives you the opportunity to build pipelines and storage to serve that load that integrate with others, and then to expand those in a way that you can pick up additional customers, whether they're electric generation facilities or manufacturing facilities and really have a full pipeline. So what we tend to look at is where we have a load and we're the one that has that load, whether it's a utility or, it's a \u2013 or a contract with PEMEX or it's a contract for LNG export that we like to have assets that integrate with that load. And so that would be kind of our priority for looking at assets as to how they could be more integrated with our business. I mean, REX is fine, but it didn't integrate with anything we had. We only had a 25% interest in it. We didn't control it. It has contracts expiring. It's just really didn't fit our model. And I don't want that to tell you at all that we're reluctant to get into other midstream assets. We are very interested in getting into those types of assets.", "But they need to provide us more growth. And when we look at REX, we just did not see the profile as providing the kind of growth. But there's some interesting assets that we're starting to look at now that maybe come on market that we are already in existence, and then there's some that we foresee the need to develop that we think would be really interesting as well.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Hello, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "So, I just want to be clear on \u2013 if I were trying to replicate your business plan with my own financial model that we take the balance sheet capacity you have, and we just assume that you buy the shares back at some higher stock price as we compound out four years of growth. And that would be a pretty low implied return on equity on that capital relative to what you would consider a competitive hurdle rate for an actual infrastructure project. Is that a fair articulation of the math?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Greg. I think you figured that out actually quite well. One of the things we struggled with is that when we do our base plan, the only things we put in our base plan are things we already have contracted and our expected utility earnings and that \u2013 most others, when they build those plans, they put aspirational projects and we don't do that. So then when we looked at that and we thought with all the projects we have at our contracts and what that would yield, and then looking at all the cash flows we have coming from the projects that are in service at that time and what that did to our FFO to debt, we just said, there's no way we would sit with that FFO to debt on our balance sheet at that time.", "So what's the most conservative assumption we could put in and decided that to do a stock buyback with the most conservative way to handle it. But I'm going to turn it to Joe to talk a little bit more about how you might think about that in your question.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Greg, I want to emphasize the two key factors that she mentioned that are the element of the base plan. It's built on the strength of our regulated utilities and the already contracted infrastructure business that contributes to the strong balance sheet and the cash flow. So we did kind of what you said, we looked forward, we had to pick up price, we estimated the price based on a reasonable utility multiple several years out and used that as a way to develop the optional share buyback. And I think that our goal is really to develop infrastructure and beat that. And so the earnings from those projects will replace this and that's the goal that we expect to achieve.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Great. I would presume once we get to Analyst Day that you would give us a similar framework of, this is what we have on the list of things that are moving ahead. And then the checklist of that aspirational items that we could hold you to either achieving or not achieving as you move through time, much like you did last year?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely. We'll do the blue box, which is the base plan, and the green box, which is the aspirational items. And I mean, the key thing is that that some of those aspirational items will replace these stock buybacks, obviously. But to the extent that we can do more of those projects, they would also be additive to the stock buyback. And so we'll go through all of that with you at the Analyst Meeting as we usually do.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Great. Switching to Aliso Canyon, the costs obviously are up pretty significantly since the 10-K disclosure of around $330 million, if my memory serves me correctly. Can you give us what the incremental costs have been in basic buckets? Has it been mostly the extension by the judges of the relocation program? Or has it been other items that have also been significant?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'm going to refer this to Dennis so he can kind of walk you through some of that and what's happening relative to the relocation. But the majority of these costs are associated with relocation. The vast majority \u2013 I think it's about 70% of the costs are relocation. So, Dennis, do you want to kind of walk him through that a bit?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Sure. Good afternoon, Greg. You're right. If you think back when we reported in the 10-K, the costs were about $332 million. Since that time, we have had the relocation program extended at least a couple of times by the courts. So if you look at the change of about $333 million, the majority of that has been relocation, a 70%. Then you basically have two other buckets. So about 15% of the overall total relates to the work of stopping the leak, building the relief wells, the root cause investigation that's underway and everything and then you've got the buckets of the other costs related to legal and other out-of-pocket. So, those are the three main 70% relo, 15% for the stopping the leak and the investigation, and then the other 15% related to legal expense and other costs.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thank you very much. Take care.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. On the TdM asset sale, I suppose that with the sale sort of announced, did that mean it was difficult to get a long-term contract on that plant for sales into Mexico? Is that the genesis behind why this asset is being sold? I thought that this would fall underneath that bucket of assets that could be under a long-term contract, but maybe that wasn't a possibility.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'm going to have Mark talk about that, but it had been sold into the U.S. previously. And we were working on the possibility of trying to sell it into the Mexican markets. But as we looked at the asset and the difficulty in that, we decided that it was not likely to be not long-term contracted in the near-term. Mark, do you want to...", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the plant right now is configured only for sale into the U.S. We've looked at and we have a plan to connect it into the grid in Mexico. It could be that in the not too distant future that there could be a long-term contract opportunity with the CFE. The CFE did just sponsor and build a new plant very close to our LNG facility in \u2013 down by Ensenada. And so, it's going to delay for some years the need for additional capacity in that region.", "And also to \u2013 just with those kinds of plants, fossil fuel-fired plants in Mexico, the contracting periods are not as long as they once were and so we started to see that this asset is not likely to meet our kind of long-term contracted objectives and therefore, we thought that we ought to put it on the market and see if we \u2013 and move to sell it.", "All that said, I think we have certainly a reserve price in our heads that if we don't get it, or don't get it, then we'll rethink that. But I think we're in very good \u2013 we're looking at trying to move forward on it.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, makes sense. And then just going back to Aliso, just want to understand. So, you're saying that you probably won't get any major final report from the agencies until late 2016 or 2017. Are there going to be any initial findings that come out through the regulatory process over the next few months?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say there were some initial findings from DOGGR that indicated that SoCalGas was in full compliance with all the rules that were in place at that time, and DOGGR came out with those findings early on from the preliminary review. But right now, the work that Blade is doing on-site in conjunction with CPUC, I don't think we're going to get any preliminary information. What they'll do is they're gathering the data and then they'll write the report, and it's likely that report will be out at the end of this year or early next year.", "Dennis, do you want to add to that?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Well, the only thing that I'd add to that, Debbie, is that there's a lot of work going on not just under the root cause investigation with DOGGR, the CPUC, and Blade, but work to get Aliso back up and running. And I can tell you right now that it's really clear that the regulators and policymakers truly understand the importance of Aliso Canyon and gas storage to both gas and electric reliability. So the tone is basically, let's make sure it's safe but let's get it back up and running as quickly as we can. And so far, we've got \u2013 of the 114 wells at Aliso, about 100 wells of them have completed the Phase I inspections and we're transitioning those now to Phase II so that \u2013 our target right now, Faisel, is to have the field ready for full operation obviously subject to DOGGR confirmation. But by late summer, probably late August, so a lot of work going on there.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then the storage field would not be able to go back into operation until this report comes out? Or could you put it back into service before then?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Well, today, we've got about 15 billion cubic feet of gas, so if needed, we can withdraw. We're just not allowed to inject until the field has been confirmed ready by DOGGR. And as I said, our current target right now is to have wells ready for re-injection by late summer.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And that is before the full report will be out.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah. And that's separate from the root cause analysis. So those things don't \u2013 they aren't linked. The root cause is going down one work stream and then there's a separate work stream to get the field back up and running.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, makes sense. And then just on REX, just wanted to make sure I understand the \u2013 I guess, what you had initially had in guidance in the past. So, did you always have the legacy REX interest that you have going to zero earnings in 2020? Just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. No, you understood it correctly. I mean, we basically had \u2013 it was de minimis in 2020 because we had looked at the contracts all expiring in 2019, and then there was debt refinancing that needed to be done and so we looked at the economics of that. And so when we were putting our plans together, we were not expecting REX to continue at the kind of run rate that \u2013 we told you that it was $60 million for the 10-month we have this year. We were not expecting it to continue at that kind of run rate after those contracts expired in 2019.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That makes sense. So do you expect the contracts to expire and nothing would happen after that, or did you also \u2013 did you expect some re-contracting but at a lower rate? Did it also include the east-to-west contracts that were signed?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Yeah, we looked at all of that and we expected that there would be some contracting at a lower rate. Mark, do you want to...", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. Faisel, yeah, obviously, we did. We had a projection of what we thought the re-contracting rate would be, and then we also assumed that we would continue with the east-to-west contracting that we've done and that we had a market check on that, and that's what was in our plan. But that combined with the interest cost and some refinancing that we thought was going to happen, it just didn't have a material impact on our financials beyond 2018.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, got it. Then last question for me. With the midstream and MLP markets coming back, to some degree, off the bottom, I'm just wondering \u2013 and also with the sale of REX, does this mean the MLP is completely off the table even in the future?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say nothing is off the table in the future. I mean, I would never do that. We will always look at what's the lowest cost of capital for us to grow, and that's the way we look at it that \u2013 REX was not a core asset for the MLP anyway since we only owned a fraction of it, and we really didn't have the ability to use that as openly as you would an asset that you had 100%. And I would say Cameron trains 1 through 3 are excellent assets for an MLP. But those would not be off the table, but right now if you kind of look at where that market is, it's certainly not our top priority.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Understood. Thank you, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple of them. First of all, Debbie, can you talk about the portfolio and whether you think there's anything else within it that you wouldn't view as core or strategic to Sempra over the long-term? And if so, why?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. No, there's nothing that we identify right now that fits that category, Michael. We look at our assets all the time. And the \u2013 all of our assets or other assets really are pretty well long-term contracted. The only one that comes up that we look at constantly is gas storage and that we do have still contracts on gas storage that have some duration left on those contracts. And we look at that and say how does that fit with our other assets? And what we see happening kind of in the Gulf region with the export of LNG, the conversion of coal to gas and need for different type of assets to support that and then looking at the storage market right now, we kind of think that the timing on that asset, if things aren't going to happen, they're going to get better, not likely worse. And so, that's one we constantly look at but we have concluded on that at least for the time being. It doesn't seem like something that we would want to try to get out of our portfolio at this time.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. When you talk about the $18.5 billion capital plan over the next five years, how much of that is at the two core California utilities?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's about $12 billion of that at the two California utilities, so the vast majority of that. And there may be some opportunities \u2013 I was going to say, there may be some opportunities for the utilities to actually consume more of that. There's some projects that we have that are on the green sheets that we show you that we're hoping to get some accrual on that would add to the capital expenditures at the utilities during that time. But we really put in that only the ones that we have some great visibility and high certainty that we either have rate case approval or project approval from the CPUC or FERC.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And last question, how are you thinking about the growth rate in the South American utilities relative to the rest of the Sempra portfolio? I ask only because if I back out the FX impact, it still doesn't seem like it was a huge growth rate and going back over the last couple of quarters as well, just curious how you are thinking about that business and its organic growth potential.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I mean, we still see a lot of organic growth potential there because similar to Mexico, there is huge needs for infrastructure in those countries. And we're looking at quite a few things right now in Peru, in particular. Mark, why don't you maybe hit a little bit about some of the things that we'd looked out and opportunities for growth.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Right. I mean, there is huge infrastructure needs there. I do think both economies, probably Chile more than Peru, but both economies have been affected by the downturn in the mining sector and effectively China's downturn. And so I think that's hurt the overall growth. But I think when you look at them, where they've been historically and what the expectation is for this year and next year, we still see strong underlying growth that you just don't see in any domestic utilities. So, you're seeing \u2013 you still see here the 3%, 4% customer growth and 3%, 4% energy growth coming back. And we \u2013 I think, with the recession, we've had a little bit of a downturn there, but it's \u2013 but we see that coming back.", "And then on top of that, we see some large infrastructure needs, which really wouldn't be available to us if we weren't active in that market in the utility market there. There, we just wouldn't have a presence to be able to capitalize on those. And so I think we're \u2013 again, we don't put those in our plan because we don't have them signed up yet, but we're close on several things. And I think it looks promising. It looks like that there's definitely some activity level that's going to be happening down there that will increase the growth for those facilities.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks, Mark and Debbie. Much appreciated.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Thanks.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "The next is Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Debbie. Couple quick questions. First on the assumptions on the rate case. So you highlight that the guidance includes the settlement, including the repair tax treatment. Could you just remind me that \u2013 I recall that not being a big number, but I just want to make sure I know what the number is for the prior repair tax treatment?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me have Joe walk through the repair tax treatment numbers for you. Let me talk about the rate case though while he's getting the precise numbers on that. What I would say is on the GRC that we've been given every indication that we should be getting a decision soon. And that we're expecting since we had 8 out of 11 parties sign on to the settlement that we would likely get the settlement as the outcome.", "We would also expect to get a repair allowance because we feel like we have very strong argument and have differentiated ourselves in terms of how we handle that in our rate cases going forward and returning the benefits to customers. And so we would anticipate getting a decision hopefully very soon and that very consistent with the settlement. And what we've been told is that the hang-up and the delay is not any different than when you're hearing from every utilities commenting on their proceedings is that there's just a lack of resources at the commission right now, especially in the ALJ division, to get some of these things out as quickly as they would like. And so we anticipated that that would come earlier but that we continue to be told it will be soon and that it's really more hung-up because of their resource issues.", "Okay? Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Steve. Hey, let me just...", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "...remind you all. Jeff and Dennis and their teams have been working closely with the commission on this issue, and we've tried to emphasize with them that we have very unique facts that are differentiated from some of the other utilities. And some of those things relate to \u2013 our rate case was actually worked on and closed and officially closed by the ALJ before we made our changes in the tax treatment. And in our 2012 GRC, we offered up a sharing mechanism much like we have in the past, and that was rejected. It was denied. So we've kind of offered up avenues for them to look at this kind of things. And as we've talked about before, there's very good precedent that the savings you generate before next rate case for all kinds of things, tax and general operating \u2013 flow to shareholders. So we think this will be resolved favorably, but let me get to the numbers that you asked about.", "There's two timing periods that are important. One is up through 2014 and then one is 2015. And I'll talk about the first period first. So from the beginning of the rate case through 2014, the interveners that applied for this suggested that we had about $90 million at each utility that they want to be adjusted through rate base. So that would be a rate base adjustment and the impact, if we lost that, we don't think we will, but if we lost that, the impact would be $6 million to $7 million at each of the utilities kind of going forward because of that change in rate base. But then the commission asked us to put a memorandum account together for 2015 savings from this tax repair allowance. And if we were to lose that issue, we will, of course, appeal it and fight it. But if we were to lose it, we would have to take a charge of about $70 million that's broken between the two utilities, but in total, $65 million to $70 million in total for the 2015 memorandum account. Again, I think these are things that we expect to go in our favor. We're giving you all the data...", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "... we've done before.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. But I guess the main reason I asked the question is a scheme of a range that's $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. These are pretty small when you look at the ongoing impacts.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Very small.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "They are really not meaningful, so I didn't know why you highlighted it out, because it really doesn't move the needle very much at all.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. It doesn't move the needle at all in the outer years. It was really a 2016 issue because...", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "... if that decision were to come out in the next couple of weeks and we had a negative result and we didn't want to surprise anybody.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And just on the Aliso, with the changes to the relocation that you set up, could you give us a sense of what the ongoing like weekly cost is? Is there some way to get a sense of that?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me hand it to Dennis. I think that one of the things that we need to put in perspective is that we've made a lot of changes to the program that reduced the cost from where it was. And so, Dennis can walk you through including the number of people that are going home now which is quite significant. Dennis?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Hey, Steve. Yeah, let me give you a little color around that because I think as we get some questions, people want to understand and put in perspective. When you look at \u2013 first of all, the leak, as you know, was permanently sealed back on February 18. And at that time, when you look at the number of people that were impacted, it was really \u2013 the vast majority of the households around Aliso Canyon, they never left. They stayed at their homes. Everything was safe and everything. So, it was a smaller number to begin with. But since then, we've had over 54% of any impacted residents that have actually gotten back to their homes, and every week, we're seeing more and more. So, to give you an actual run rate is difficult because, as Debbie said, we're doing things within our program that allow us to \u2013 and help the residents move safe from hotels to corporate-style apartments, more family-situated apartments with kitchens where they can cook and everything, and that helps bring down the cost.", "The other things that we're doing is we've been offering in-home cleaning services to give further assurance to residents that everything is safe. So, while we haven't given an official run rate, what we can tell you is that the number that we gave out for the $665 million assumed relocation expenses through June 7. And as we said, we expect to get additional information from the Department of Public Health this month regarding their testing. And I think that type of information will even further get people more comfortable that they can go home and we'll see the numbers continue to drop week after week.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "And then just very quickly, last question, Debbie, any incremental color to your year-end call on news on Cameron 4?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me just ask Mark to address that since we've been having some conversations with Oct\u00e1vio recently about how those discussions are going and actually feel pretty positive about what we're hearing from the customers and the high level of interest. So, Mark?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. I \u2013 Steve, thanks. I think the big thing \u2013 the point to keep in mind is as far as U.S. LNG exports go, we believe train 4 will be one of the least expensive options available. So that's why we have \u2013 we continue to have pretty good interest from people looking at securing that option early and maybe even in advance of when world demand may require it. So, we are feeling pretty confident that it's going to move forward.", "Our original statements that we made on the last call at the end of the year or two were that we expected to have something wrapped up by the end of the year and that our FID amount would be in the first part of next year. And that hasn't changed. So, we're still working towards that. And if we get any indication that things are different, we'll tell you right away. But I think right now, we're still feeling like this will happen sometime this year.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And then I would add to that just that you all read about what's happening in the markets. And we have great expressed interest from customers. I mean, they're spending time. They're putting teams on this to negotiate with us. So it's not like they're just saying, oh, we like this, do something. They're actually dedicating resources to this. But this is a very challenging market to get agreements signed and so I just want to counterbalance that. And honestly, if we get agreements signed in January or February of next year versus December of this year, I'll be a happy camper.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yes.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So we're really focused on it. And as I said, it's not like the counterparties are not engaged fully. They are engaged fully. So...", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Rose-Lynn Armstrong at Barclays.", "Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi. How are you, Rose-Lynn?", "Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I'm well. Can you just talk with a little bit greater specificity about the construction progress at Cameron trains 1 through 3? And then separately, regarding the Aliso estimates of $665 million, can \u2013 with regard to the relocation assumption in there, are you assuming that the same number of households are relocating over the entire period? Or is there a decline in trends through June 7?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Let me take the LNG question first and talk a little bit about that and then have Dennis address the assumptions on the relocation. So for Cameron 1 through 3, we're 43% complete. The construction is going really well. We're all slightly ahead of our construction schedule. I would say on schedule but if you look at some of the data, we're slightly ahead. And that we're still expecting train 1 to come on in March of 2018, train 2 to come on in July of 2018 and 3 in November of 2018 which was the schedule that we had outlined for you previously.", "So, everything is going very, very well there. I would say the safety performance has been exceptional on the job. And that the major materials, the long lead time materials have all been ordered and everything is moving on quite well in construction. I don't know, Mark, is there anything else you want to add?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "No. I mean, I think, right now, the project is moving as smoothly as we could have expected. It's in very good shape.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So, then your second question related to the assumptions that are in the $665 million on the relocation, and let me have Dennis address that.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Sure, Rose-Lynn. Yeah, as I mentioned, what we did is we assumed that the relocation cost would continue through June 7. And we basically \u2013 to be conservative, we've assumed that they stay flat throughout that period. Now, what we are seeing, and this was incorporated into our assumptions, is that as we're cleaning more homes, people are going home. They're being \u2013 they're even more comfortable that their homes are safe and everything. So, we are seeing more and more people go home that way.", "The other thing that we've been doing that we incorporated into our assumptions is as we're able to locate more of the family-style corporate housing options within the area, we're transitioning more people from hotels where they're also receiving per diem to these corporate apartments where they have their kitchens and we don't have to pay the per diems. So, those are the types of \u2013 and that's part of the program that we have. That's part of the approved program. So, that helps reduce the overall cost as well. So, all those things are built into it, but we aren't assuming a huge drop-off. But we are seeing that on a week-to-week basis, so I think that's favorable.", "Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, to Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So, I just wanted to touch base just to revisit Steve's question on the growth rate and the repairs deduction, just to understand this. The impact is roughly \u2013 approximately $70 million in 2016. And then after that it really doesn't have much of a significant impact afterwards. Is that the way to think of it?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Paul, this is Joe. Yeah, that's the way to think of it. But the $65 million to $70 million is not in any of our numbers. We're assuming that we win that, we don't have that impact. So it's really...", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Quite right.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "...if we get a negative impact going forward, there's just really very \u2013 it's not significant, not material.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Just wanted to double-check on that. And then with respect to the $100 million to $120 million of capacity release and the loss that you guys expect to take in the second quarter on that, what would it have been if you \u2013 I mean, this is not completely clear. What is it that \u2013 I mean, you did describe it and I apologize, but what would it have been if you hadn't done that? Would it have just been pro-rated through, what was it, 2019 or something or...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Paul, I said that and so I'll say it again, so it's clear it'll be in the transcript. I said that in our plan, the one that we gave you last year, we had for 2016 and 2017 between $5 million and $10 million of losses related to this capacity because we had a lot of capacity sold forward. It wasn't exactly at the same price we were buying the capacity up. It was pretty close. So, we had a $5 million to $10 million loss for 2016 and 2017. That did not take into account some of the recent financial troubles that some of the capacity holders had. So, if we had kept it, we would have had bigger losses going forward, which is why as we try to sell this forward on a permanent basis, we're taking a bigger loss than you would assume from the $5 million to $10 million that had been in our plan. But for you to go adjust your plans, you were probably basing them off of our numbers, and I want you to know what was in our numbers before which was $5 million to $10 million for the next couple of years.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then the potential buyback, that's kind of a placeholder. And if I understand it correctly, you guys are aiming for better returns with investments and what have you. But the 12% has this as a placeholder in the event that you were for some reason not able to find investments. Is that the right way to think of it?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Paul, that is the way to think about it. What I'd like to emphasize is, look, we're pretty unique here. Most of our peers whether they're utilities or midstream companies or renewable companies are issuing equity to grow. We're actually growing our earnings and our cash flow so fast and increasing the strength of our balance sheet and increasing our dividend 8% to 9% a year over this period that we're able to actually look at a potential buyback if we don't capture some of these projects we're working on, but we fully expect to capture those projects and do better. We just showed this as an optional thing that it's within our control and we can do. That's unique.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So if you were to be able to find the investments, the 12% would be on the lower end of the range? Is that the way to think of it?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me just add to that that the 12% is based upon what we already have under contract and in construction. And what our expected utility earnings would be assuming we get the settlement in the rate case and then we just assume in out years that we use attrition in addition to that. So we try to use conservative assumptions for that, but then we show you all the development projects. And in this time, we thought that using the assumption of the buyback was conservative because we wouldn't be sitting there with 22% FFO to debt on our balance sheet and not do something with it. What we fully expect in the next five years that we will have projects that will have a much better return than what we're showing you with the stock buyback. But we have, as Joe said, we have wonderful flexibility.", "To be able to show you five years what we have long-term contracted that yields that kind of a growth rate and gives us the strength of the balance sheet that gives us the flexibility, if we were not to find projects, to buy back stock, which we don't think is going to be the outcome because we have a robust backlog of projects that we're working on. But it's just a wonderful position to be in and honestly, this is what I was going to talk about at the Analyst Meeting because not too many others can talk about having a strengthening balance sheet, having this type of a 12% growth rate with conservative assumption, and then having the ability to grow the dividend by 8% to 9% over that five-year period of time with nothing else.", "So, that was going to be a lot of my presentation. I'm (01:07:53) closing kind of what we're going to be talking about, but it's a really great position to be in. And since we didn't do the Analyst Conference, we wanted you to all understand where we stood relative to that, and we'll go into a lot more details as we always do when we get to the conference.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Debbie Reed for any closing comments.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks for all of you joining us today, and as always, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact our IR team. We look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Conference. We will let you know as soon as we get a date scheduled so that you can plan around that. And thank you very much for being understanding with our decision to postpone that. We would not likely have done that, but we also want to do the best job possible in outlining our business. And I think having the certainty of a rate case decision will be a much better position at the end when we really talk to you about the business. So, have a great day and we'll see you sometime hopefully in July.", "Operator", "This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2013 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's 10-K and most recent 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC later today.", "Important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2013 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 6, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to Slide 3, and let me hand it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The second quarter was an important one for Sempra, as we received the final decision in our General Rate Case for SDG&E and SoCalGas. This decision provides us with a sufficient level of revenues to maintain a safe and reliable system for our customers and provides regulatory clarity for the company through our current rate case cycle, which runs through 2015. Additionally, we continue to move forward on many infrastructure projects during the quarter, and I will give updates on some of these projects a little later in the call.", "Now let's move to Slide 4. Our consolidated financial performance this quarter was strong, and that performance, coupled with our efforts to control costs within the revenue structure we were granted in our GRC, allows us to remain on track to meet our full year EPS guidance. This guidance of $4.30 to $4.60 per share is updated to exclude a $119 million loss of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS. This guidance also includes the 2012 retroactive benefit from the GRC of $77 million. We remain committed to achieving the 6% to 8% long-term compound annual growth projections we laid out at our analyst conference in May. This growth rate is based off of our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share, which excludes both the 2012 retroactive GRC benefit and the $119 million loss at SONGS.", "Annual earnings from SONGS were between $15 million and $20 million, but that has now ceased as of the date Edison decided to retire to facility. Our guidance for the year reflects our view that we will overcome the loss of these earnings through better performance across our business.", "Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the financial results in more detail, starting with Slide 5. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $245 million or $0.98 per share. This compares to earnings of $62 million or $0.25 per share in the same quarter last year, which included a $179 million impairment charge on our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. This quarter, we reported a loss of $119 million related to SoCal Edison's decision to permanently retire SONGS. We estimated this loss using California utility regulatory precedent to determine the expected recovery of SONGS rate base assets, replacement power cost and O&M during the time of the outage. The loss is slightly higher than the top of our previously disclosed range as additional analysis and the most current information was taken into account since the date we filed our 8-K on the topic.", "After excluding the SONGS loss, second quarter 2013 earnings for guidance comparison purposes were $364 million or $1.46 per share. As Debbie indicated, our year-to-date performance was strong and allows us to remain on track to meet our guidance of $4.30 to $4.60. Additionally, this quarter's results include $106 million for the retroactive benefits from our final General Rate Case decision. $77 million of this benefit is associated with 2012, and $29 million is associated with the first quarter of 2013. Without those benefits and the loss at SONGS, adjusted earnings for the period were $258 million or $1.04 per share.", "Keep in mind that our results for the first half of 2013 include the $63 million planned annual repatriation tax expense, which we recorded in its entirety in the first quarter. Additionally, first half results include the dilutive effect of our highly successful IEnova IPO.", "Now let's go through the results for each of our segments in detail, beginning with San Diego Gas & Electric on Slide 6. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $65 million, down from earnings of $95 million in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of the loss at SONGS and the GRC retroactive benefits for 2012 and Q1 '13 of $69 million, SDG&E's adjusted earnings grew to $115 million.", "The increase was due to $15 million of higher CPUC and FERC margin and to an $11 million reduction in 2013 income taxes. This reduction resulted primarily from the change we made last year in the tax treatment of certain transmission and distribution repair expenditures, an increase spending on self-developed software. These increases were partially offset by $4 million of lower revenue from our cost of capital decision and $2 million of lower earnings due to the loss of SONGS rate base margin as a result of the closure.", "Now please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter 2013 earnings at Southern California Gas were $118 million compared to earnings of $53 million last year. Excluding the GRC retroactive benefits for 2012 and Q1 '13 of $37 million, adjusted earnings at SoCalGas in Q2 '13 grew to $81 million. The improvement in earnings was driven by $15 million of increased income tax benefits in 2013, primarily as a result of a change in repair expenditures for natural gas pipelines similar to the one I just described for SDG&E and by $9 million of higher CPUC-based margin due to the final GRC decision. This quarter's results also benefited from $4 million positive variance due to the full recovery of transmission integrity management program costs in 2013, which were not balanced in the 2012 revenues.", "Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 8. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $34 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to earnings of $38 million in the same period of 2012. The decrease was due to a loss related to the sale of our investment in 2 Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. In June, we completed our exit from Argentina through the sale of our investments in that country for $13 million. As we discussed last quarter, the completion of this sale will produce a tax refund of approximately $80 million, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2014. This tax benefit was previously recognized in earnings in prior years.", "Second quarter 2013 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $26 million versus earnings of $47 million in the second quarter of last year. The decrease is due to $10 million of lower tax benefits in 2013 versus 2012. These are largely related to currency and inflation adjustments; also $8 million from noncontrolling interest at IEnova related to our reduced ownership; and $4 million lower earnings from operations, primarily related to the planned major maintenance that occurred at our gas-fired generation plant in Mexicali.", "Now please turn to Slide 9. Moving to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $9 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $193 million in the year-ago period, which includes last year's $179 million impairment charge on REX. The increase came primarily from improved earnings from LNG and gas storage operations mainly due to changes in natural gas prices this year.", "The Renewables segment generated earnings of $15 million in the second quarter of 2013, down from earnings of $24 million in the second quarter of 2012. The decrease is largely driven by deferred tax benefits in 2012 from solar assets placed in service last year. This decrease was partially offset by higher levels of production tax credits from our wind assets, many of which were placed into service in late 2012.", "Now let me hand the call back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. As you know, in June, Southern California Edison, the majority owner and operator at SONGS, made the decision to shut down the plant. As a result of this decision, SDG&E established a new regulatory asset in the amount of $322 million, which reflects management's assessment of the amount probable but not certain of recovery in rates for SDG&E's investment in SONGS.", "Additionally, SDG&E recorded a loss of $119 million after tax due to the plant closure. Due to the outage of SONGS from January 1, 2012 through June 6, 2013, which is the date Edison announced the plant was to close, SDG&E has spent approximately $166 million on replacement power. The CPUC has opened a multi-phased OII to determine the ultimate recovery of the investment in SONGS and the cost incurred since the start of the outage, including the cost of purchasing replacement power. I can assure you that as a minority owner of SONGS, SDG&E will do all it can to protect the interest of its customers and shareholders as these proceedings move forward.", "Now please turn to Slide 11. Last quarter, FERC issued an order on SDG&E's transmission rate case filing, which conditionally accepted our filing, including the methodology we used to calculate our requested ROE of 11.3% and approved the 50-basis-point adder for SDG&E's membership in the California ISO. Last week, FERC issued an order making the 11.3% ROE effective September 1, 2013, subject to refund pending an approved settlement or final decision. Settlement discussions with the key parties have already begun.", "Since many of you have asked me what happens in a rising interest rate environment, I wanted to remind you that both our utilities have a trigger mechanism, which allows our CPUC-authorized ROEs to be reset if the annual average Moody's A utility bond index rate move 100 basis points above or below the benchmark level, which is currently 4.24%. While interest rates have been rising in recent months, the move has not been significant enough to raise the average rate to a level where a trigger would occur this year. However, if rates continue on a similar trajectory to what we've seen recently, the potential does exist from an upward trigger to occur effective January 1, 2015. If an upward trigger did occur, it would increase our equity return by 1/2 of the difference between the new monthly average rate and the benchmark rate. Additionally, the authorized cost of debt would be adjusted to reflect the actual cost of debt at that time.", "We continue to await a final decision on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan or PSEP and expect that decision to come out later this year. As you know, we have received authorization to track in a memo account and are currently spending capital and O&M in anticipation of a final decision.", "Let's now go on to Slide 12. Moving to our Cameron Liquefaction project, I'm pleased with the progress we are making, and we remain on track to begin operations in the second half of 2017. We currently expect EPC bids back from the 2 consortium bidding on the project this quarter, and we would anticipate selecting a final EPC contractor by the end of the year. Our efforts to secure financing for the project continue to move ahead, and interest in project financing Cameron remains very strong. We expect firm commitments from lenders by the end of the year and anticipate putting 60% to 70% leverage on the project at attractive terms.", "We remain confident that the DOE will approve our non-FTA permit in 2013. This is based both on the positive recent comments made by Secretary Moniz concerning LNG export approval and on strong bipartisan support for our project. Given the FERC schedule issued in April of this year, we expect to receive our FERC permit in February of next year, which will put us on schedule to begin construction in the first half of 2014.", "Turning to South America. As you recall, last year, a joint venture we formed with SAESA, another Chilean electric utility, was awarded 2 transmission line projects, which are now under construction. In June, this JV was awarded 2 additional 220-kilovolt transmission lines that will extend roughly 70 miles. The total project cost for these 2 new lines is expected to be about $80 million. 50% of which will be Sempra's share. And we expect construction to be completed in 2018.", "Let's now move on to Slide 13. At IEnova, we recently signed a contract with PEMEX for the first phase of the Los Ramones pipeline project and expect to begin construction in the fourth quarter of this year. This 48-inch pipeline, which is 70 miles in length and starts at the US-Mexico border is South Texas will be a part of our JV with PEMEX, and the total project costs are expected to be between $450 million and $550 million. This pipeline is expected to commence operations in the second half of next year.", "The second phase of Los Ramones is a 450-mile pipeline project, which is estimated to cost roughly $2 billion. The pipeline will begin at the terminus of our Phase 1 project and extend into Central Mexico, bringing gas supply to this region of Mexico for the first time. Bids for the second phase of Los Ramones are due this quarter, and IEnova will most likely submit a bid, potentially with a partner.", "We continue to make good progress on our $1 billion Sonora pipeline project, and we have now signed both the construction and pipeline supply agreement. We remain on schedule to begin construction on the pipeline this quarter and expect the first phase to be operational in the second half of next year.", "I'm really pleased that our team at Sempra International has been able to execute on these opportunities. We continue to see a number of very strong incremental opportunities in this business unit that will help us grow at or above the 6% to 8% range we laid out at our analyst conference.", "So let's now go on Slide 14. While it is unfortunate we had to take the loss at SONGS, I am really pleased that we had such a strong quarter otherwise. We continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solid performance for our shareholders. We remain on track to meet our earnings guidance for the year, and we continue to have very compelling long-term growth prospects.", "And with that, let me stop and take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Faisel Khan, Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. There's an recent sort of news about the potential to change the foreign tax rate for repatriation of overseas earnings. Just wondering if you can just remind us if we're going to move to more of a quasi-territorial system as what might be outlined in some of these tax trade publications? What will be the earnings impact or benefit to you guys? And then I have a follow-up.", "Debra L. Reed", "Let me first remind you of what we've committed to do under the current tax situation, and then I'll have Joe kind of talk about what's happening in Washington right now and what the impacts might be with that. What we committed to do under our -- under the current tax situation is that we're repatriating about $200 million this year and then about $300 million over the next 5 years back and that we're doing that by using the net operating losses that we have as a result of some of the bonus depreciation we had at the utilities. And so that is the plan that we're working currently. As you know, under the tax laws, they looked at changes that may change the overall corporate tax rate, and with doing that, then we would get a benefit. And I think the number was something around $30 million. But Joe, let me ask you to go into more details.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Sure. Yes. It sort of depends on where they land here. As Debbie mentioned, if they were to drop the rate such -- to like 28%, something that the President suggested the other day, Debbie's right. Instead of about $60 million a year of expense, we'd have roughly $30 million. But if they were to go to a more territorial system, which we've been advocating, perhaps, they might do something that would have no tax, although they might actually impose some kind of a onetime tax to bring back some of this money that's sitting offshore in many companies. So they might impose sort of a 5% tax or something like they have done previously. And in that case, certainly, it would lower the earnings impact that we have in our plan today. So it would be very beneficial to us.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then just you guys ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash on the books. It looks like you had a number of asset sales, including the IPO of IEnova. What's the plan with the $1 billion in cash? Is it to pay down debt? Or is it -- is that how you're going to reinvest that cash or give it back to shareholders?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Faisel, this is Joe. Let me talk about that most of that cash that's sitting on the balance sheet right now is either in Mexico or in Chile. As we've talked about before, we are not repatriating any of the funds from Chile because we would have an incremental Chilean tax, and we're looking for investment opportunities for that sum, which is around $300 million. The other $500 million about is sitting in Mexico, and that's money that was raised in the IPO and is going to fund the Sonora pipeline project.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Naaz Khumawala with Wolfe Research.", "Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Just had a couple of quick questions for you guys. First of all, if you exclude Argentina from South America, can you discuss how Chile and Peru are doing year-over-year?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. If you take Argentina out, Chile and Peru are right on track to what we would be anticipating and kind of what we laid out for you at May at the Analyst Meeting. We're having good performance from both of those companies. The growth rates are very positive, and the ranges that we've talked about before, we're seeing customer growth of 2% to 3.5% and load growth of 5% to 6% in both of those utilities.", "Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay, great. And then for SONGS, what's the ongoing impact to earnings from pulling SONGS at a rate base?", "Debra L. Reed", "The ongoing impact, what -- well, what I can say is what, historically, we've had is about $15 million to $20 million a year of net income from SONGS. And as I mentioned in my comments, certainly, for this year through looking at cost efficiencies and in some of the improvements in our operations due to advancements of technology that we're deploying and all, we feel that we can offset that for this year. And so we were able to include that in our updated earnings guidance that we would still be in the $4.60 -- $4.30 to $4.60 range, including covering off that loss of SONGS income for this year.", "Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Right. Now I mean, I appreciate that but just sort of thinking about next year and forever or are they cost efficiencies, stuff that you guys can keep?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we'll look at -- we'll update our guidance as we always do in February. I mean, what we will certainly look at continuing to look for ways that we can improve the operations of our business as we always do and look at some opportunities to offset that. One of the things that hasn't been factored in and will be factoring in when we do our guidance is what is needed to replace SONGS and what that would mean in terms of additional investment. And so all those things we'll be looking at the before we give updated 2014 guidance in February.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of just quick questions on some of the international projects. The number, I think, on the Los Ramones looks roughly the same. I was just wondering, with the Chilean project that you won and the announcements that you highlighted, are these projects all already fully included in your planned CapEx as of the Analyst Day?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The -- on the Analyst Day, we had the Los Ramones Phase 1 that we talked about, and then we had the Chilean first 2 transmission lines in Chile. The second 2, that I mentioned today that we had just bid were not in the capital plan. But as Joe mentioned, we have plenty of cash in Chile to fund those projects.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And you had mentioned for one of the projects, I believe, Mexico, the second phase, you had mentioned a potential partner. Would that be a domestic partner you'd be looking at or maybe another multinational?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we're still looking at that right now. The bid hasn't even come out. We're looking at -- September time frame is what they've said for the bidding on that. And so we're, of course, pursuing all possible options and looking at how we would want to handle it. We haven't made any decisions.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just last one, I guess, that, as you said, it's a little too early with the bid not out yet, but is there kind of a, would you say, a greater interest in bidding on these projects, maybe a little bit more competition circling the market? Or it's a little bit too early to comment?", "Debra L. Reed", "Mark, why don't you just talk about that?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, I would say that it -- there's certainly interest in Mexico. I think there's -- the people recognize that there's good growth there and that these are good projects. But I do think that the companies that have historically been successful in Mexico, of which, obviously, we're one of the leaders in, are the ones that are -- continue to be successful. And I think it's just a knowledge of the market and knowing how to get things done there. But it is attracting more international investment, but I think the companies that have been doing business in Mexico for a long time still have some advantage.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a question on Cameron. In the event that the DOE doesn't issue the non-FTA approval until, say, next year, how does that impact the overall timeline and construction of the project?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, first of all, we expect that to come this year. And that's -- every indication that we received and most recently a key person that works with Moniz, his energy counselor, Melanie Kenderdine, commented that he had completed his review of the data. He had completed his review of the analysis to ensure that the public interest analysis was done appropriately. And he had affirmed that no further modeling was required. And so we would anticipate having him now completed that we will start seeing these projects roll forward. It's not on a critical path for us yet because the FERC permit comes after our expectations on the non-FTA. And so as long as we have both of our permits in the first quarter of next year, then we're pretty much on path.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And in terms of the incremental investment opportunities above the 6% to 8% growth that you laid out at the Analyst Day, can you talk you about -- and you talked about Latin America and some of the opportunities there, but where do you stand with the opportunities in California and under, I guess, the shale gas revolution?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we gave you the slide at the Analyst Meeting, and we broke it down into utilities and midstream and renewables. And just to give you a highlight of some of the things we're working on, as I mentioned in the utilities for San Onofre and what needs to be put in place with San Onofre retiring, there will most likely be some incremental transmission investments that would be necessary but also the gas system because to replace San Onofre is most likely a combination of renewables and natural gas will be necessary and that we will be looking at what type of investments will be necessary in the gas system. And so that is underway. In Latin America, we talked about Los Ramones Phase 2. We're looking at clearly moving forward with -- to the extent that we can on the Santa Teresa Hydro II project. And then we talked about the additional transmission in Chile, and then we'll continue to look at other things there. And then in the U.S. midstream area that we have made a filing to do some laterals on REX, that's a public filing and that we're also looking at the assets adjacent to Cameron, the LA Storage and then the Cameron pipeline and would expect to be developing those assets in the same kind of time frame as Cameron. And then on the Renewables space, we're certainly looking at any additional opportunities there, including if there's some to get -- some potential to get some wind projects done before the clock ticks away and that we no longer have the opportunity for the production tax credit. So those are all kind of underway right now in those areas.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I guess, actually, following on a little bit on the REX comment on the laterals and I understand there's some sensitivity around this likely. But can you comment just generally REX's future as a bidirectional pipe and then also, how that fits into a drop-down MLP strategy on a go-forward basis?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Let me just say that this is something that we told you before we were looking at because we saw the flows out of the Marcellus and Utica and needing to get to market. And so this has been something that we've been quite interested in for a while now, and now we're pursuing it with a new partner. So let me have Mark kind of talk a little bit about that.", "Mark A. Snell", "I think the future of REX, it will, over time, start to look a giant header system for the Midcon. And it'll take flows from both directions and probably feed into Chicago and other Midcon markets. I think that'll take some time. There are some tariff issues, and you've probably seen the news on some of the issues with existing shippers. All of that has to get worked out. But I think, over time, that's where this asset will go. We probably, as far as the MLP-able, it's obviously an MLP-able asset, but until a lot of these issues are resolved, there would be one that wouldn't drop into an MLP right away until we kind of had some long-term predictable cash flows out of it. But we have -- the good news is we have plenty of other MLP-able assets that are very strong. And obviously, with the Cameron facility, we'll have very good assets that we can look at developing that kind of infrastructure down the road.", "Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And just to follow on, again, kind of midterm, are there incremental ideas that may be percolating around REX today?", "Mark A. Snell", "Oh, there are, and we're pursuing them right now. And I think there's likely to be some near-term kind of things coming out of REX that's showing additional revenue possibility.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Figured I'd follow up with a few more questions. On the LNG project, the, I think -- can you just clarify that you're expecting the construction permit in February of '14?", "Debra L. Reed", "What, we're expecting in February 14 is the FERC permit, which basically allows us -- without the FERC permit, we cannot begin construction, and so that's what we're expecting in the February time frame.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So after that, you guys can start construction. So starting February -- assuming you get the permit in February '14, you'd start construction right away. There's no other permit that's required after that.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, yes, there's a few months between when you get the permit and when you can actually begin construction. But assuming that we get the permit in February as we expect, then we would be on our construction schedule that we've laid out to have the first train come on at the end of 2017.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And just on this project queue that everyone keeps looking out for the -- for all these -- for all the liquefaction projects, it seems like the DOE is going in the project queue order. I mean, are there criteria that the DOE has to look at in order for a project to get the approval? Or is it simply having the application in place? I mean, how do you guys -- what's your opinion on how you see the DOE looking at each application? Is it -- you guys have talked about having to have the FERC application, the process and all those other things. Can you just remind us what the key criteria are to kind of get that FTA?", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure. The FTA criteria is really that in order not to approve the permit, they have to show that the project is not in the public interest. So there's a presumption that these projects should get approved, and that's an important factor. And there's been nothing that has come out in any of the public studies that have been done, the EIA studies or any of the studies that have been done that have demonstrated that exporting is not in the public interest. And so what we think has happened is after the Freeport project was approved, Moniz stepped into his job. He had made a commitment to go through the data and to go through the determination of public interest that had been published earlier in the NIRA report. And as we understand, he has completed that work now and has affirmed that, that work is accurate and no further studies are necessary. So what really should happen is that these projects should move forward then in the queue because that report showed that the projects are in the public interest and to export LNG. And the projects actually -- the report actually showed that the more LNG you export, the more on the public interest it is. So we would anticipate seeing some projects start going through the queue now that he's completed his affirmation of the data. Mark, do you want to add to that?", "Mark A. Snell", "I [indiscernible]...", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sorry, go ahead, Mark.", "Mark A. Snell", "No, go ahead, Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was going to ask is it -- I mean, does it really have to be in order? I mean, is that -- is the DOE committed to reviewing each application in order? And so if they're going to do one application every few months, is that kind of -- does that put you guys on track to get the permit when you want? Or are they going to -- do you think they'll issue permits in kind of batches?", "Mark A. Snell", "Let me try to answer that. I mean, we're all speculating on what we think the DOE is going to do, and so there's a high degree that we'll be incorrect. I think we all thought, a lot of us and, not just us at Sempra but other companies as well, Dominion and others, all thought that there may be some of this would come out in batches. It seemed reasonable to think that, that was going to happen. In hasn't happened yet. That doesn't mean that it won't happen. It could. But our belief is that even if we stay on the schedule that Moniz has laid out and he does do them one by one under some thoughtful process, we still believe we'll get ours by the end of the year. So I think we're -- we feel comfortable that we're on track to do this. As Debbie said earlier, it's not a -- it's an important permit obviously. We have to get it to secure our financing and all the other things. But as long as we get it this year or very early next year, we're still on track, and it doesn't really -- doesn't change our timing as long as it's within a reasonable time frame.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then I was also wondering if you guys had any opinion on the low carbon fuel standard and sort of the carbon prices we're kind of seeing in those forward markets now and if that has any sort of impact to you guys or if that's just a pass-through to the consumer?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I'll have Mark...", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, let me tell you from a business perspective that we're looking at. I mean, we have talked a little bit in the past. We are looking at LNG and natural gas as a fuel, and a lot of the low carbon standards, especially in the shipping industry, is things that we're looking at, and we see opportunities there to provide infrastructure to that industry, both shipping and the railroad industry to use natural gas. And so we do -- we think that there's going to be some real benefits and growth opportunities in the future around those kinds of regulation.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And any sort of update on natural gas vehicles and transportation infrastructure for natural gas vehicles? I mean, you guys put a lot of stuff on your website related to this sort of topic and just wondering if something is sort of moving forward at SoCalGas or maybe outside of SoCalGas.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we've done a lot of work at SoCalGas on the fleet side, and we have a lot of fleets operational now. We also were able to put something in place at SoCalGas, which is a Compression Services Tariff where we can actually serve compressed natural gas directly from our pipeline system. So we're doing those kinds of things. But I think probably the more interesting things are some of the things that we're doing in our U.S. Gas & Power and looking at the potential to develop some market opportunities there. So Mark, you want to?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. No, I just think, just as I said, I mean, I think the opportunities that look to have the best potential to really be significant in the near term, I think are on the commercial side, both on the maritime and railroads and large haul trucking and those kinds of things as opposed to passenger vehicles.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI.", "Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Jon Cohen calling in for Greg. What is the earliest date that you could lock down financing for Cameron? And is there any way to hedge out your interest rate risk between now and when you close on your construction loans?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Let me have Joe talk about that because we were just talking about that this morning, and we've done some analysis on the interest rate impact. And also, Joe, do you want to?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Sure. What we're focused on is getting these commitments later in the year. We want to make sure that we do them in the right time frame so that commitments don't expire before we actually draw down the money. But it's progressing very well. There are more meetings going on all the time. And we're getting strong, very strong indications of interest. So the financing is going along well very well. We will look to do hedging when we have the commitments in place, and we're talking to our partners about that. Interest rates have moved some, but it's pretty modest. The impact is really pretty modest based on the numbers we have in our plan. So we will, in fact, do a significant amount of hedging. The timing will be probably closer to the end of the year or beginning of next year, depending on when we and the partners agree on the structure.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time for closing remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Debbie Reed. Please go ahead.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thank you. Well, thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we have Rick Vaccari and his team available to answer any follow-up questions you have from our call today, and thank you very much for being with us. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

(Operator instructions).  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Martin.  Please go ahead.", "Jeff Martin", "Good morning.  I\u2019d like to thank each of you for joining us.  This morning we\u2019ll be discussing Sempra Energy\u2019s 2008 financial results.  A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Neil Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer, Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Debbie Reed, President and CEO of our utilities and lastly Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You\u2019ll note that slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement.  Please remember that this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.

It is important to note that all the earnings per share amount in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis.  And with that I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Don Felsinger who will begin with slide number three.", "Don Felsinger", "", "Thanks, Jeff, and again, thanks to each of you for joining us.  I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the strength of our financial results especially when considering the current market environment.  All of our operating businesses performed well for the quarter and for the full year, and several of our businesses have record earnings.  ", "I\u2019m also pleased with all of the successful milestones we reached during the year.  We accomplished a lot in 2008 but more importantly we laid the groundwork for our future growth.  As a result, we\u2019re reaffirming our previously announced 2009 earnings guidance of $4.35 to $4.60 per share.  ", "Now to the financial results.  Earlier this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of $319 million or $1.30 per share up from fourth quarter 2007 net income of $289 million or $1.10 per share, an 18% increase in quarterly EPS.", "Net income for the full year 2008 was $1.1 billion or $4.43 per share compared with $1.1 billion or $4.16 per share in 2007.  As we go through our 2008 results there are a couple of things to keep in mind.  First, our earnings per share results reflect the benefit of the share repurchase program that we initiated last April.  Also, our full year results were negatively impacted by the reduced ownership in our commodities business. ", "Now let me hand it over to Mark Snell.  He\u2019ll take you through each of the business unit financial results beginning with slide four.", "Mark A. Snell ", "Well, our California utility saw improved earnings in 2008 helped by a strong fourth quarter.  At San Diego Gas and Electric, net income for the fourth quarter was $81 million, an increase from earnings of $47 million in the year-ago quarter.  The increase was due primarily to $16 million in higher operating margin, $11 million to a lower tax rate and $8 million in higher regulatory awards.", "Full year 2008 net income increased to $339 million up from $283 million in the previous year.  At Southern California Gas fourth quarter 2008 net income was $54 million compared with $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  SoCal Gas was impacted by higher litigation expense during the quarter.", "Full year income increased to $244 million in 2008 up from $230 million in 2007.  Now let\u2019s go to slide five.  ", "Sempra commodities reported net income of $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $186 million in the prior year's quarter.  Led by crude oil and petroleum, the joint venture had strong contributions from all of its product lines.", "Full year 2008 income was $345 million compared with $499 million in 2007.  2008 net income benefited by $67 million from the gain on sale from the formation of the joint venture with RBS, offset by $30 million in charges primarily related to litigation and tax matters that occurred in the second quarter.  ", "This is our third reporting period under our new joint venture with RBS and reflects our reduced ownership in the business.  You\u2019ll recall that prior to the second quarter of last year Sempra had 100% ownership of the commodity business.  Now let\u2019s move to slide six where we\u2019ll review how income from the joint venture with RBS is allocated.", "Here we show how income is allocated as a joint venture both for the quarter and its first nine months.  A couple of highlights; first, the joint venture had income of $374 million during the quarter.  After applying the income allocation methodology the distributable income to Sempra was $253 million.  After adjusting to U.S. GAAP and for the impact of taxes, Sempra\u2019s joint venture equity earnings for the quarter were $162 million. ", "In the first nine months since its formation, the joint venture earned $1.4 billion in margin on a mark-to-market basis.  After operating expenses, the JV earned $675 million.  Sempra\u2019s after-tax share of the earnings since April 1st was $252 million.  Now please move to slide seven.", "Fourth quarter net income for our generation business increased to $60 million compared with $40 million in the same quarter in 2007.  The improvement in the fourth quarter of 2008 was due primarily to lower income tax expense.", "Net income increased to $222 million for the full year 2008, a 37% increase over last year's net income of $162 million.  The increase was driven by improved plant operations due to the absence of maintenance outages we had in 2007.  Also, lower income tax expense and solar investment tax credits that were earned from placing the El Dorado Energy solar facility into service.  Please move to slide eight.", "Sempra Pipelines and Storage net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $22 million up from $14 million in the same period in 2007.  Mexican pipeline operations contributed $11 million in the fourth quarter compared with $3 million in the same quarter in 2007.  The increase was primarily due to earnings from LNG-related pipeline contracts.", "The Rockies Express West Pipeline, which went into service in early 2008, contributed $10 million of earnings in the quarter compared with no contribution in 2007.   ", "For the full year in 2008 net income increased to $106 million up from $64 million in 2007.  Full year 2008 includes $27 million of earnings from Rockies Express and $18 million of improved earnings from Mexican pipeline operations.  Please turn to slide nine.", "Now this slide provides a summary of our business unit results.  I\u2019d like to point out a couple of things here.  First, Sempra LNG recorded a net loss of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with a net loss of $19 million in the prior year.  The improvement was primarily due to a tax benefit related to currency and inflation adjustments.", "At Parent and Other, we recorded a loss of $49 million in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $38 million in the same quarter in 2007 primarily due to losses on non-qualified assets in support of executive retirement and deferred compensation programs.  ", "I\u2019d like to note also the fact we had a very low effective tax rate in the fourth quarter.  There\u2019s principally two things going on here.  First, we have a dollar-based debt related to our Mexican assets.  A weakening peso in the quarter created a Mexican tax deduction and drove a large tax benefit.  Second, and what complicates it here, is that earlier in 2008 we put into place a hedge at the parent to offset the impact of Mexican foreign currency changes.  This hedge negatively impacted operating income in the fourth quarter.  ", "Removing the effect of the hedge loss and the Mexican peso adjustment, the tax rate would have been 22% and our net income for the quarter would have been reduced by $22 million, or something less than $0.10 a share.  For the year the tax rate was 29% and the effect of the hedge loss and the Mexican currency adjustments reduced income by $12 million.  ", "Now please turn to slide 10.  Now I'd like to update you on our liquidity position through the end of the year from what we've previously provided on our third quarter call.", "When the debt markets opened up briefly in the fourth quarter, we felt it was prudent to take advantage of a market window that had been completely closed for several weeks.  We issued $1 billion of new debt at the holding company and SoCalGas.", "As of December 31st we had $3.2 billion of cash and availability under committed bank lines.  After adding our planned sources of cash, including $300 million in issuances of utility debt and the re-marketing of $200 million of IDBs, we expect to have $5.5 billion of total funds available.  After netting our planned uses for the year, we still expect to have excess liquidity of $2.2 billion at the end of 2009.  ", "Now please turn to slide 11.  In summary we expect our current liquidity to cover our net funding needs through the end of 2009 by over three times.  Since our last update in November we improved our excess liquidity position by about $700 million.  We also have the flexibility to defer some capital spending if necessary.  But keep in mind this liquidity outlook assumes we issue no debt outside of our utilities.  It is much more likely, markets permitting, that we would issue debt and strengthen our liquidity position going forward.  ", "Now please turn to slide 12.  We're really very pleased with our financial results, particularly in a difficult environment.  Earnings per share for 2008 were up 6.5% over 2007's results, even after considering that we sold 51% of our commodities business at the end of the first quarter.  We had record results in several of our operating businesses.  We have ample liquidity and last week we increased our dividend over 11% in accordance with our previously announced dividend policy.", "And with that I'd like to turn it back over to Don who will begin with slide 13.", "Donald E. Felsinger", "", "Now let me update you on some operational priorities starting with our utilities.  In December we reached a major milestone with the California Public Utility Commission's approval of the Sunrise Powerlink transmission project.  ", "After several years of thorough review the commission concluded that the Sunrise project was the best option to increase reliability and bring renewable energy to the San Diego region.  We're continuing pre-construction activities and expect a $1.9 billion transmission line to be placed in service in 2012.", "Turning to our smart meters program at SDG&E we'll begin full scale installations next quarter.  Our goal is to have 200,000 meters installed by the end of this year and have all installations completed by year end 2011.  And at SoCalGas we have filed for regulatory approval of $1.1 billion smart meter program of which $900 million would be capital.  We anticipate the program will be approved later this year and installations will begin in 2011.", "Before moving on, I'd like to briefly you on the litigation resulting from the 2007 wildfires.  As many of you know, SDG&E is facing numerous lawsuits relating to this issue.  The largest claims are from insurers who have thus far paid out approximately $1.4 billion to homeowners.  ", "There are several defendants involved in addition to SDG&E, with various amounts of insurance coverage.  We are the largest with $1.1 billion of insurance and Cox Communications, the local cable company, is second also with substantial coverage.  In light of the other defendants and given that we would expect the claimants to compromise as part of any settlement, we have not accrued or reserved for any amounts except for our normal deductibles.", "Now moving to some of the projects we have under development at Generation, LNG and Pipelines and Storage, in the fourth quarter we placed into service the 10 megawatt El Dorado Energy solar facility.  This project is the largest thin-film solar powered project in North America.", "At peak production El Dorado Energy Solar generates enough electricity to power over 6,000 homes.  All of the output of the plant is sold for 20 years through a power purchase agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric.", "Turning to our Cameron LNG receipt terminal we've experienced some delays in construction at Cameron, and we're currently in discussions with our contractor to see if we could accelerate the timeline for completion.", "Nonetheless, in our best judgment we expect to receive our first start-up cargo at the end of next quarter and begin testing the facility, all with the view toward commencing terminal operations in the third quarter.  The associated Cameron Pipeline is complete and ready to transport gas from the terminal when it comes online.", "Now let me update you on our natural gas storage strategy in the Gulf Coast region.  As you know, we believe natural gas will become an increasingly important fuel in this country and it's in our pipelines and storage business that we are focused on getting new sources of gas to premium markets.  That's why we're increasing our presence in the Gulf.", "Whether the gas is coming from new, unconventional production or LNG or both, the southeastern market needs storage services.  And our recent acquisition of EnergySouth storage assets puts us in a position to build out a total of almost 90 Bcf of high-deliverability storage by 2015.", "We have over 11 Bcf of storage in operation today and just last month we were able to increase our ownership in Mississippi Hub from 60% to 100%.  Currently Mississippi Hub's first 15 Bcf of storage capacity is under construction.  Operations are targeted to commence next year.  Our development plan calls for eventually increasing the total Mississippi Hub capacity to 30 Bcf.  You'll recall that Mississippi Hub was part of our October 1st acquisition of EnergySouth.", "A quick update on our Liberty Gas Storage project.  For the last couple of months we've been looking at several low-cost solutions to improving the well integrity at one of our caverns.  We have testing underway to determine the effectiveness of our corrective measures, and we expect to know more in a couple of months.  In a worse case, were we not successful, we would have $65 million on an after-tax basis at risk if we have to impair this asset.  ", "And finally regarding our 25% interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline, progress continues on the east portion of this pipeline.  We anticipate interim service next quarter, with the line fully complete by year end.  Labor escalations and some of the work-around issues that were required as part of the permitting process for the east portion have placed cost estimates for the entire Rockies Express Pipeline now at $6.2 billion.", "Let's now go to slide 14.  Let me just say, in summarizing where we are, that I'm very pleased with the strength of our financial results for the quarter and full year 2008.  Most importantly we've accomplished all of this against the backdrop of a tough economy which I think reflects favorably on our business approach of strong risk management and contracted returns with certainty of cash flows.", "Two thousand eight was a busy year for us, and we accomplished many major milestones that will provide a great platform for growth in the future.  A combination of our business approach and recent accomplishments has allowed us to reaffirm our 2009 guidance in a very trying market.", "We'll be getting into more detail around our strategic initiatives and our five-year financial outlook at our annual analyst conference March 26 in New York.  We look forward to seeing many of you there and with that what I would like to do now is open up the call and take questions that you may have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Your first question comes from Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets. ", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Congratulations on a great quarter, quick questions on the commodities business.  There's been a lot of news floating around RBS.  Anything change over there that we need to think about in terms of how it affects the JV?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, Lasan, thank you for your comments.  We are extremely pleased with the relationship that we have with RBS.  There have been a lot of rumors circling around about whether RBS is a long-term player in this market and I would just say this, that we have had several board meetings and other meetings with our principals that we interface with at RBS, and the only discussions we have had are about how we implement our strategy to grow this business, to fund it, and take advantage of the unique position we have in the marketplace today, as we have had other people exist from this commodities arena.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "So can we expect $200 million in earnings the first quarter?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, we like the position we're in.  As you see we have extremely low commodity prices right now and this business I think is attractive both to us and to RBS because, one, we are one of the few players that are still left in the marketplace and we have a goal to keep growing this business out side of North America.  That's the current plan for both us and for RBS.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Excellent.  On the LNG front, can give us a sense of how much you expect to see coming to the U.S. and if Cameron will benefit from that upside on the open uncontracted volumes at Cameron?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, Lasan, I think the way I would answer this for you is that we have been saying for a number of years that there is a lot of liquefaction capacity coming online in the next few years. And that capacity will outstrip the ability of Asia and Europe to absorb it and that means that North America will be the final destination for many of these cargos. ", "The position that we are in with our LNG facilities, we 'e probably as well positioned as anyone because not only do we have facilities on the East Coast, on the West Coast, and the Gulf, but we are only 65% contracted and so we have the ability to take advantage of spot cargo opportunities.  So it is a position that we kind of look forward to participating in.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Excellent.  One last question, any decisions on whether REX will continue to Princeton, New Jersey?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well this is a very, very troubling economic market for a lot of the people that would be looking as off takers on this pipeline.  My optimism about this pipeline moving forward anytime this year has been diminished.  I think we're going to have to wait until we see the market turn around, some of the distribution companies getting into a much stronger environment before anyone will make a commitment to sign up for capacity where we can extend this pipeline further east. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Goldenberg with Luminous Management. ", "Michael Goldenberg \u2013 Luminous Management", "", "Still trying to understand a couple of things as they relate to taxes, as well as other income on Corp front; if I just looked up the Corp segment by itself, there is obviously a very large tax benefit and I\u2019m still having difficulty reconciling it.  Do you mind breaking down the negative $99 million head or $99 million benefit to taxes on the Corp level?  And then I also wanted to ask about other income at the Corp level. ", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well that would be good.  I think that that's probably something we ought to talk about, because I noticed coming in here this morning that there were several things that came across my computer screen that talked about the strength of our earnings in the fourth quarter being tax-driven.  That is entirely untrue.  We had from an operating standpoint both a very good year and a very good quarter, and I think we ought to spend some time talking through why that is. ", "You want to take this one Mark?", "Mark A. Snell", "Sure.  Michael, as I think you probably recall, but others on the call may not, in \u2013 we did get a benefit in the fourth quarter from our position in Mexico. And that benefit derives from the fact primarily because we have some dollar, some U.S. dollar-denominated debit in Mexico.  And when revalued that for tax purposes into the peso, depending on the strength of the peso it, with a weak peso, that becomes a tax benefit and it can become a tax liability with a strong peso. ", "And what happened in the fourth quarter was we had this rapidly declining peso which created a large tax benefit and the problem or the issue there was, when you look at it, it resulted in a very, very low tax rate.  Now that's only half the story, because during the year, and on the early part of the year we had a strengthening peso, a very strong peso, was creating a tax detriment and we in order to prevent that from getting any worse we had put a hedge in place. ", "So when you look at table A, that was in the package that we released this morning, you'll see other income expense net a negative 77, which is approximately $100 million swing from the prior year.  Well a big chunk of that almost, half of that is the loss on the hedge, which is offsetting that tax benefit and also in that number is some other kind of one time items, the biggest one being some losses on assets related to deferred comp and other nonqualified pension plans that were sort of one time drops. ", "But just the two tax items, they don\u2019t necessarily offset each other, but like I said in my scripted remarks, if you take out the effect of the hedge and take out the effect of the benefit from the change in the peso, you end up with about a 22% tax rate for the quarter and about $22 million left income. ", "But for the whole year, when you look at the whole year, we had a tax rate that was roughly 30% and the actual \u2013 the effect of these hedges and the currency adjustments actually reduced income for the whole year by $12 million. So it's really a misnomer to take a look at the strong quarterly earnings and just attribute it all to tax benefits, because you're really not taking into account the extra expense in other income. ", "Michael Goldenberg \u2013 Luminous Management", "", "Just to summarize, the minus 77 for the quarter, if you assume roughly half, so there was roughly $35 million pre-tax loss in that 77, is that correct?", "Mark A. Snell", "It is actually $44 million, and then that was the loss on the hedge, and there is actually $57 million related to those assets, of a loss related to those assets for deferred comp and other nonqualified plans. And then those two numbers are offset by some positives.", "Michael Goldenberg \u2013 Luminous Management", "And how much was the tax gain in that 99?", "Mark A. Snell", "The tax benefit, yes, $30 million was the benefit.", "Michael Goldenberg \u2013 Luminous Management", "Okay, that makes sense.", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay.", "Michael Goldenberg \u2013 Luminous Management", "I\u2019m sorry I must have missed this.  What is the latest for in service date for REX East?", "Dan Felsinger", "The end of this year.", "Michael Goldenberg \u2013 Luminous Management", "End of this year, okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar", "just had a quick one also about the Rockies Express. I\u2019m wondering if given your new, your updated cost outlook, I\u2019m wondering what sort of returns you guys are targeting now for that project?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "The unlevered returns on that project are currently about 6%, 6.2% or so.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar", "6.2%?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Unlevered.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar", "Unlevered.  All right, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Brothwell with Wachovia. ", "Sam Brothwell \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hey.  Obviously commodities had a very strong fourth quarter.  Would you \u2013 kind of the character where that came from, is that driven mainly by just the very favorable commodity environment that you were in or is this also driven by some new business resulting from bringing in RBS as a JV partner. ", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, Sam, it's really all those.  I think the thing that we've talked about in quarters and years past is that this is really five little small businesses.  We're not tied to any one commodity.  We're a strong physical player, but we're in oil, natural gas, electricity, metals, all of those businesses in a quarter perform very well.  Helped by the fact that RBS has been taking us around the markets we haven't been in.  So, it's a combination of all those things working very effectively.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Annie Sal \u2013 Alliance Bernstein.", "Annie Sal \u2013 Alliance Bernstein", "My question's been answered but I \u2013 it's the same question as to do with the large tax benefit in the \u2013 at your corporate level.  But I have a follow-up question.  You said if you take out the $22 million in income the tax rate should be about, the whole year should be around 30%?  Is that right?", "Mark A. Snell", "No, Annie, the tax rate for the year is roughly 30% and for the year we had a tax detriment because of the \u2013 between the hedge losses and the currency adjustments of a negative $12 million.  And then for the quarter, if you take out the Mexican currency adjustments and the hedge loss we would have had a tax rate of 22% and our income would have been reduced by $22 million.  So we benefited by $22 million in the fourth quarter.", "Annie Sal \u2013 Alliance Bernstein", "So what kind of normalized tax rate we should use for '09?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "For '09 we expect to be a pretty much a full taxpayer.", "Unidentified Corporate Participant", "Yes, low to mid-thirties.", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Annie, but you know I would suggest and I'll make this offer, is that any of you that want to pursue this in more detail, as always, you can call Jeff, Glen or any of the staff here.  But the message I want to leave you with, that we had just great operating results for the year, and great operating results in the fourth quarter.  So we want to make sure and clarify with you that what you're seeing here are not one-time items coming in to impact earnings.  But it really came from the strength of our operating business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Question for you, is there an update on the Liberty Gas Storage project?  I apologize.  I missed the first few minutes of the conference call, so if you discussed it in the first five or ten minutes I'm happy to follow-up offline.", "Donald E. Felsinger", "You did.  But let me just repeat that again.  We mentioned to you, I think the last call, that we were struggling with the integrity of one of our caverns.  For the last few months we have been going through and putting in place some low-cost solutions that we're currently testing out.  ", "And I would expect that within the next several months we will have an answer on whether or not we can get this cavern to work.  In a worst case scenario, where we have to abandon this cavern, we would be looking at a write-off of something that would be around, $65 million after tax.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Separate and a little bit unrelated question, when you think out the next five to seven years at pipeline development in the western U.S., which are the major pipelines, whether yours or someone else's, that you think actually get built in that time horizon?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, we spend a lot of time thinking about that, and we've been watching with a lot of interest the activities of both Sunstone Project and the Ruby Project.  In a rational market we would think only one of these would get built.  In an irrational market, and then sometimes the way we behave, both could get built.  We currently don't have an active MOU with either party.  ", "And so we are sitting on the sideline here taking a look to see if we have any position that we would want to take with either one of these pipelines.  But I do believe a pipeline will get built.  There's enough gas in the Rockies that can supply the needs in California.  And I think this next year ought to be kind of interesting to look at what takes place in that pipeline competition.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Are there any of those two pipelines or the others that have advantages or disadvantages in terms of permitting right-of-way, siting, etc.?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "I think that they both have strengths and weaknesses from the standpoint of their routes and their market opportunities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Leon Dubov \u2013 Catapult Capital Management.", "", "Leon Dubov \u2013 Catapult Capital Management", "Two questions.  You guys, when you originally gave '09 guidance you gave us some breakdown of which business contributes what.  Could you just update us, today, where we stand on that and what percentages come from the utilities versus what percentage of guidance of '09 is expected to come from commodities?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, we're going to do this in a lot of detail when we travel to New York at the end of March to update you on our five-year plan.  I think we can do that for '08.  I'm not sure we want to do it for '09 right now.", "Leon Dubov \u2013 Catapult Capital Management", "Can you just give us a rough idea to maybe what percentage regulated versus unregulated?  Is that easier?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Mark, why don't you go ahead and just give a general overview?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, I think, generally speaking, the breakdown that we gave you last year, with the targets by business unit, are going to be very similar.  There's going to be some little bit trading between the units but I think especially as to the split between commodities and the non-commodity businesses that should be roughly the same.", "Leon Dubov \u2013 Catapult Capital Management", "On a different note, we kind of hear a lot in the news about the economy in California and them having trouble balancing the budget.  Is this having any effect at all on the regulatory environment or are the Commissioners more conscious of it?  We're seeing the Edison general rate case being delayed and I'm curious if you guys have a view as to what effect this might be having?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "I'm not sure that the status of the various utilities and their regulatory applications.  But I think one of the things that we have done, is we got through the regulatory process and put in place a four-year rate plan.  And we're currently operating off that.  So we don't plan to go back to the Commission for another two to three years to ask for any changes.  ", "I think we got everything that we wanted that works well in this environment.  As you know, in California we don't have any commodity exposure, we don't have any shareholder sharing mechanisms with customers in the settlement.  And from the standpoint of our attrition years we just have fixed-dollar amounts not tied to customer growth.  ", "I think the thing that's going on in California is we do have a troubled economy right now but from our standpoint the good news is, is that commodity prices are really down.  And so when we look at the billings that go out to our customers they are probably at a low point right now.  So it means, from an affordability standpoint, that people can look at their utility bills as something that are manageable to pay.  Debbie, do you want to add to this?", "Debra L. Reed", "I would just add that 2008 was a great year in getting rid of any risks in our business.  We got our general rate case, as Don mentioned.  We also got the Sunrise decision.  We had our storage incentive mechanism approved by the CPUC, and our energy efficiency approved.  And so, last year we cleaned out a lot of cases and eliminated a lot of risk in our business.  And now we're moving forward with our growth plans to get our Smart Meters installed, to get Sunrise constructed and to move forward.", "Donald E. Felsinger", "I think there's a certain amount of foresightedness that we have at this commission led by [Mike Peavy], and that is taking the long-term approach.  And so looking at what we need to set the state on a course that is driven by renewables and energy efficiency and some control over our energy future, we are spending money today for infrastructure to make that happen.  And I see that commitment, not only at the CPUC, but also at the Governor's office.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Colin Rush \u2013 Broadpoint Capital.", "Colin Rush \u2013 Broadpoint Capital", "Can you talk a little bit about the roll out of solar in your asset base, how you see that playing out?  And how you're benchmarking pricing going forward if you're looking at the wholesale electricity market, or if there's another benchmark that you're using?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Neal, do you want to talk about solar for a second, both at the utility and at Sempra Generation?", "Neal E. Schmale", "We have solar activities going on, as Don mentioned, both in the utilities and in Sempra Generation.  Starting with Sempra Generation we recently dedicated a 10 megawatt thin-film plant outside of Las Vegas, Nevada.  And it's the largest thin-film plant that\u2019s been built and we are looking at the possibility of expanding that by about another 50 megawatts in that area and what we need to do in order to expand that is to sign a long-term contract to take the output as we have done with respect to the first 10 megawatts.  So that\u2019s going ahead and I think it should go ahead reasonably well assuming we can get a contract.", "We also control several thousand acres of land where we can build more solar particularly around Mesquite plant in Arizona.  So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us to develop solar to sell into the markets in the southwest near our existing power plants.  Now that\u2019s all on the Sempra Generation side.  ", "On the utility side, they put in an application to spend up to $250 million to develop solar in basin in the San Diego area and that\u2019s currently in the hearing process.  And given the kind of support that the California Commission has exhibited for these kinds of projects, I think there is some potential that that could go ahead on a fairly large scale as well.  ", "Colin Rush \u2013 Broadpoint Capital", "Are you looking at the market price referent plus the time of use premium for pricing these systems or is there another metric that you guys are using?", "Neal E. Schmale", "Well without getting into the details of the pricing as a practical matter when you\u2019re selling into the California markets, you have to look at the time premiums that are there in the market reference price because those are the kinds of things that are considered in the regulatory regime and that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re dealing with, what the regulatory regime will allow in terms of purchases.", "Donald E. Felsinger", "But Colin, I think you can expect to see us both at our utilities and our Sempra Generation business pursue solar investments.  ", "Neal E. Schmale", "And just one final question and thanks so much for all the detail on this.  Are you evaluating any other technologies other than the thin-film technology that you worked with on your 10-megawatt facility?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Yes, we\u2019re evaluating various technologies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [Charles Sherritt] \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "[Charles Sherritt] \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Could you walk me through the scenario in which RBS says that they don\u2019t want to be part of this JV anymore on their call on Thursday?  Would you take the trading book back on your balance sheet?  What\u2019s your thinking there?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well, they\u2019re not going to say that on Thursday so we\u2019ll start with that but I will have Mark walk you through the agreement we have with RBS and it starts from the standpoint that we have a four-year agreement not to transact the business by either party.  Mark?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, a couple things.  I mean, again, let me just reiterate what Don just said, which is we have been in constant talks with our partner and you know I can\u2019t speak for them but I will tell you what they have said, which is if there was to be any change in the JV status, they would have informed us by now and I can say they have not.  So we feel very comfortable that this JV will stick together.", "But with that said, if they down the road decided to change their minds, the first hurdle is, is the agreement itself has a contractual obligation that neither party would try to sell or get out of the agreement for four years.  We\u2019re not quite a year into that yet but we have about, we have roughly three years to go on that.  So I think contractually they\u2019re bound to do that. ", "We do think that the support that they\u2019re getting from the U.K. government would completely eliminate the possibility of any kind of a fire sale or something where we had to do something very quickly without careful planning and thought.  I think we\u2019re kind of in a stable position now with RBS and the government influence that they have on the bank has stabilized them to the extent that if we were to do something, it would be we would have a negotiation, we would figure out what the right thing to do is.  ", "And we kind of think as our worst possible downside is sort of getting our capital back at book, which is $1.6 billion, which is what we have invested in the business.  And I think that\u2019s sort of a downside and frankly that\u2019s about $6.50 a share so you can do your own math and decide whether there\u2019s more than $6.00 a share at our stock now for the commodity business.  ", "But I think as we look at this business going forward, the opportunities for growth and the ability to really capture a market with not very much competition right now is so good and our results for the last quarter and our ongoing results have been so positive, that I think that this is a very valuable asset in the long run and I think the bank recognizes it and I think we certainly recognize it and it\u2019s something we\u2019d like to stay in for a while.  ", "[Charles Sherritt] \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "And in follow up, so does that mean that under this worst cast scenario where you get the capital back, you would take the business back?  Is that the right way to think that?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, I think we\u2019d certainly have an opportunity to do that if we wanted to.  I think our ideal would be to find another partner if that was the case.  One of the things with this business is it would be hard to run it in the size that it is on our balance sheet; that\u2019s the reason we looked for a financial partner in the first place, so I don\u2019t know that we would take, you know that we would take it all back but I think what we would do is work it out over time with the bank and figure out something that makes sense for everybody.  ", "[Charles Sherritt] \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So you would take a smaller piece of it back?", "Mark A. Snell", "Probably.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from [Tom O\u2019Neil \u2013 Green Arrow].", "[Tom O\u2019Neil \u2013 Green Arrow]", "Just a quick question on the utility.  The GRC was struck in a pretty highly inflationary environment and subsequent to that, we\u2019ve seen some pretty good deflation or it looks like we will.  Just, if I understood your comments correctly, those were fixed revenue increases that don\u2019t really have a [inaudible] mechanism that would reflect change in environment?", "Mark A. Snell", "You\u2019re correct.", "[Tom O\u2019Neil \u2013 Green Arrow]", "And just your comment about not going back in for the next two to three years, could you just remind me when that rate deal runs through?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Debbie, do you want to walk through this?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, just to, Tom, to give a little flavor the fixed revenue requirement.  We will be getting about $95 million, $93 to $95 million each year for the next three years and the end of the rate period.  It started in 2008 and it goes through 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "A lot of my questions were answered but I just wanted to, and I\u2019m sorry if you guys went over this and I missed it, what\u2019s the effective tax rate you guys are expecting in 2009?", "Male", "Thirty percent.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar", "Hey guys, just one more question.  Sorry, I had forgotten to hit this on the first time around.  But I was wondering if you had, in your expectations for LNG shipments for the year, if you had maybe an explicit forecast for cargos that you\u2019re expecting?  I know you had said you\u2019re expecting one cargo in Louisiana for the test but I\u2019m wondering if you had an explicit sort of forecast for what would be hitting your facilities?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "We have nothing in our earnings outlook for cargos.  The cargos that we are anticipating bringing in at Cameron are for start-up.  We do expect spot cargos to make themselves available to North America in the second half of this year.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, so you had said you were 65% contracted and the rest, that 35% you\u2019re expecting spot cargos?", "Neal Schmale", "We do expect, this is Neal Schmale, we of course do expect cargos from [Tangu] to come into the eco-plant later in the year, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to?", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Contractually, our BP cargos start arriving later this year.  Spot cargos we look at as strictly being opportunistic and of course in Cameron there\u2019s going to be a function of when our plant goes into operation, which I said we plan to have that happen the middle of this year.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today.  I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Don Felsinger for any additional or closing remarks.", "Donald E. Felsinger", "Well once again, thanks to each of you for taking time to join us today.  If you have any follow-on calls, you know how to get a hold of Jeff, [Ben] or [Scott] and look forward to seeing you in about a month in New York and laying out our five-year plan.  You guys have a great day.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference.  Thank you for you participation.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Martin. Please go ahead sir.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Good afternoon. I would like to thank you for joining us to discuss Sempra Energy's 2007 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, President and CEO of Sempra Utilities, and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You will note that slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

Because we are holding it in New York City, there has been a lot of interest and we are hopeful that you will each make time to join us.", "And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Don who will begin with slide 3.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Jeff, and thanks to each of you for joining us. Here is how I would like to proceed with today's call. Mark Snell and I will start with the financial results, and I will update you on the status of our key business activities, and finally we will close with any questions that you may have.", "Before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to mention how pleased I am with the strength of our financial results. All of our operating businesses performed well for the quarter and for the full year. In fact, 2007 was a record year for income from continuing operations, all in all, a very good year and a great foundation for our future growth.", "Based on our outlook for the remainder of this year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2008 earnings guidance of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. This guidance reflects the closing of the Royal Bank of Scotland transaction and our reduced ownership in Sempra Commodities and the positive impact of our planned share repurchase program.", "And with that, I am going to ask Mark to take you through the financial results in more detail.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Don. Well, earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $288 million or $1.10 per share. Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was $129 million or $0.49 per share. This included $221 million for the impairment of our Argentine assets.", "Net income for the fourth quarter was $289 million or $1.10 per share compared with net income in the prior year quarter of $125 million or $0.47 per share. Income from continuing operations increased to a record $1.13 billion or $4.26 per share for the full year 2007. That's up from $1.09 billion or $4.17 per share in 2006. Last year's results included $204 million in gains on asset sales and the Argentine write-down.", "Now let's review the financial results for each of our business units. I'll start with Sempra Utilities on slide 4. Sempra Utilities reported fourth quarter net income of $105 million, compared with the $110 million in the year ago period. San Diego Gas & Electric's net income for the fourth quarter was $47 million, that compares with $55 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower taxes in 2006.", "At Southern California Gas, fourth quarter 2007 net income was $58 million. That compares with $55 million in the prior year's quarter. For the full year 2007, Sempra Utilities reported net income of $513 million, a 12% increase over the $460 million posted in 06.", "Net income for SDG&E rose to $283 million in 2007 from $237 million in 2006. That was due primarily to favorable resolution of tax issues, together with higher electric transmission and generation earnings. 2000 (sic) [2007] net income for SoCalGas increased to $230 million from $223 million in 2006, due primarily to higher operating margins. Now let's go to slide 5.", "Sempra Commodities reported fourth quarter net income of $186 million in 2007, compared with $214 in the prior year's quarter. This is primarily due to reduced earnings from our natural gas and synthetic fuel tax credit operations. For the full year 2007, Sempra Commodities recorded net income of $499 million compared with 2006 earnings of $504 million.", "And with that, I'll also bring you a short update on our planned joint venture with RBS. We plan to close the transaction by April depending on the timing of our last regulatory approval. You'll recall that the transaction was approved by the FERC and the UK's Financial Services Authority last call, and we're now awaiting approval from the Federal Reserve Board which we expect in March.", "At this point, we don't envision any material issues and we believe we will receive Federal approval as previously mentioned by the end of the quarter. While we and RBS are disappointed that the approval process has taken longer than anticipated, there certainly has been some other significant issues in the financial markets that has taken up a lot of the regulators' time and attention.", "One change I would like to mention is that the amount of regulatory capital or equity of the commodities business required has increased over our original estimates. The change, this is driven by significant increases in commodity prices since the deal was first announced and recent changes in banking regulations.", "Considering this and the 15% preferred returns dictated by the partnership agreement, we requested and the partners agreed to increase our investment. As currently contemplated, Sempra will now invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion at closing. This increase from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion that we had originally contemplated, does not affect any other aspects of the transaction nor will it affect our planned stock buyback or dividend increase.", "And with respect to those, post closing we begin the first $1 billion of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion share repurchase program and again will raise our dividend. Earlier this month we raised our quarterly dividend 3.2% to $0.32 per share and we expect to increase the quarterly dividend the second time to $0.35 a share once we close the transaction. This will reflect the 35% to 40% payout ratio at an annual rate of $1.40 per share.", "Now we will move onto slide 6. Fourth quarter net income for our generation business was $40 million compared with $53 million in the same quarter in 2006, due primarily to a 3 month outage of the company's El Dorado Energy plant in Nevada and higher taxes. The El Dorado plant was placed back in service on January 7th of this year.", "For the full year 2007, net income for Sempra Generation was $162 million compared with $375 million in 2006, which included $204 million related to the sale of the Topaz Power plant.", "Now please move to slide 7. In the fourth quarter, 2007 Sempra Pipelines & Storage reported net income of $14 million compared with a net loss of $223 million in the same period in 2006. Fourth quarter 2006 results included a $221 million write-down on the company's Argentine Utility investments, together with $24 million in taxes on repatriated foreign earnings.", "For the full year of 2007, net income was $64 million compared with net loss of $165 million in 2006. The prior year results included the previously mentioned write-down and taxes on repatriation offset by $10 million from the favorable resolution of prior year tax issues.", "Please turn to slide 8. This slide provides the summary of our business unit results, and I'll highlight a few points and I will start with our LNG business. Sempra LNG recorded a net loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter of '07, that's compared with a net loss of $7 million in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to a mark-to-market loss on a marketing agreement with Sempra Commodities where this loss was offset by a corresponding gain.", "Parent and other reported a net loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with a net loss of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to increased charitable contributions and income taxes.", "Please turn to slide 9. We are very pleased with our 2007 results. Income from continuing operations set a new record for the company and our financial results were bolstered by strong earnings from our California Utilities and Sempra Commodities. Second, we continue to have a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity with over $650 million of cash on hand and $5 billion in unused credit line.", "We also finished the year with a debt-to-total cap ratio of 39%, a 3% drop from 2006. That's noteworthy, because as we close the RBS transaction, we've made the commitment to restructure our balance sheet by repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, both of which will directly benefit shareholders.", "Now I would like to turn it back to Don, with slide 10.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark. Let me start with a short business update beginning with our utilities. In December, SDG&A received a final decision on its cost of capital proceeding which increased its authorized return on equity to 11.1% from 10.7%. This increase was effective on January 1st. You will also recall that last year the FERC increased our authorized return on equity on transmission assets to 11.35%.", "In regard to our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, we reached settlements on major aspects of those proceedings. We now expect a final decision from the California Public Utilities Commission in the second quarter of this year, and we have filed for rates to be retroactive to January 1st of this year.", "In November, SDG&E's purchase of Sempra Generation's El Dorado power plant was approved by the CPUC. The purchase will be effective in late 2011. As for the Sunrise Powerlink 500 KV transmission project, we received a draft environmental impact study last month which is an important project milestone. We expect a final decision on the project in the second half of this year which would result in the line being placed into service in 2011.", "Now let me update you on our LNG business on slide 11. Our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul terminal will begin operations in the second quarter. While the revised start date is a couple of month later than expected, the net income impact of this delay is negligible. As you would expect, there is lot of excitement about placing into service the first LNG receipt terminal on the West Coast of North America. We secured initial test cargos for the commissioning and completed the connecting pipeline. At the end of 2007, we also finalized an agreement to develop the $125 million nitrogen injection facility at the terminal. As many of you know, California has adopted some of the most stringent gas quality specifications in the country. This new nitrogen facility will allow gas from the expanded number of sources around the world to meet these more stringent specifications.", "Recently an affirmation of our LNG strategy was reiterated by FERC Chairman, Kelliher, who forecasted that the U.S. will become the largest LNG importer by 2011, due to heating and natural gas fuel generation growth. Chairman, Kelliher also said that our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul project is very important because with its commissioning, the U.S. will be the only LNG importer with ready access to both the Atlantic and Pacific markets. This will make the U.S. market increasingly attractive to LNG importers. In Louisiana, our Cameron receipt facility is 75% complete. This project remains on track for operations in early 2009 and we are still focused on contracting the remainder of capacity at Cameron.", "Now let's move to slide 12, for an update on pipelines and storage and the Rockies Express pipeline project. A major milestone occurred in January when we began interim service on the 500 mile segment of the Rockies Express west portion of the pipeline that runs from Colorado to Kansas. We expect the entire 700 mile western portion of the pipeline which ends in Missouri to be in full service next month. As for Rockies Express East, we are continuing to work closely with the FERC on permitting and expect to receive approval sometime in the spring. This will enable us to start construction in early summer and need a December 2008 interim service date.", "The total cost of the Rockies Express pipeline is now estimated to be $4.9 billion, an increase of $500 million from the original estimate. Sempra Energy's 25% share of the overall project cost is roughly $1.2 billion. As many of you know, there continues to be a lot of interest in a follow on project to the Rockies Express Pipeline that would deliver natural gas to markets further east.", "Late last year, we completed an open season for the Northeast Express Pipeline project that would extend service from Clarington, Ohio to Princeton, New Jersey. We are now negotiating with interested parties for firm contracts with a view towards making a final decision on the project sometime in the next quarter.", "Please turn now to slide 13. In summary, here is a couple of key highlights. First, all of our businesses units have performed well. 2007 saw record income from continuing operations, driven in large part by a strong year from our California utilities and our commodities business. In addition, we have some important milestones taking place this year. The closing of our joint venture with RBS, the conclusion of our general rate cases, REX-West is now flowing gas, we are commissioning our Costa Azul receipt facility in the second quarter and we have several more major projects coming online this year, an exciting time as many of our projects and activities move into the operations and earnings phase.", "With that, our outlook for 2008 has a lot of certainty and we reaffirm our earnings guidance with a range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. In 2009, we will be seeing the first full year of operations for many of the projects I just discussed, and that will be reflected in significantly stronger earnings growth in the future. We'll get into the detail behind that growth at our Analyst Conference coming up in March.", "And with that, let me now open up the call and take any questions that you might have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", ": Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from John Kiani with Deutsche Bank.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "I know you made some comments earlier on in your discussion about the RBS commodities joint venture. Can you talk a little about any... did you had any recent discussion with RBS or with the U.S. Fed?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me have Mark answer your question, but we are in contact with RBS almost on a daily basis and just to want to reaffirm to you that we expect this transaction to close here within a month.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", ": Yes, John this is Mark, I think the transaction took a little longer to close than we had anticipated, but I don't think could have anticipated the kind of financial turmoil.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Right.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", ": That the regulators have been at and you know I want to say that I think it's on... in my conversations with them, they are being diligent and they are really trying to get this done, trying to get the attention of all of the people that they need to get. It's been understandably difficult and I think this just took longer than they expected as well and so... but we are getting there and I think we'll... we expect to get that this month and we expect to close shortly thereafter.", "And as far as the conversations we have with RBS, they are meeting with us on a daily basis. We are working to integrate the two businesses and I think from the get go we're going to be ready to move forward.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks, that's helpful. And then can you talk a little bit about this gas-fired power plant that you have in early stage development in Maryland. I think I saw something for around 500 or 600 megawatts?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We had a site in Maryland for a number of years that we have not developed because the market hasn't given us the right price signals. And as we look at what's taking place right now on PJM and the fact that they've gone out for capacity payments in 2011. If in fact these capacity payments get approved by the FERC, which we think they will and we're able to deal with some local issues regarding taxes and get our construction cost at a point that they make sense to us, it's a project we will move forward with. But there is still a few open items, but it looks very positive from the standpoint of what we're seeing today.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "So just to be clear, it sounds like your expectation is that the new and higher corn prices are approved and therefore we might continue to see pretty robust PJM capacity pricing and specifically in the region in which you have sub region where you have the site and if that's the case, you very well may push forward with this development?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think as you watch construction cost for new combined cycle, we're seeing cost in a range now of $900 to $1000 of megawatt or KW. When we look at what's happening in PJM, is they need capacity and we think the prices that they have adopted and they sent to the FERC to get approved would in fact support new generation. We also think we have one of the few sites that's ready to be built upon and meet the 2011 date. So, once again, if the prices get approved by the FERC and we are able to get our construction cost estimates coming into the price range that supports our economics and deal one or two the minor issues, it's a project that in fact we will move forward with.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Don, first of all, congratulations on a good year, but more kind of looking out globally, I can't imagine you seeing back and saying to yourself, there are no acquisition opportunities on the horizon... or in the mixed today that you are looking out and I can probably give you three companies that might be of interest to you. How you kind of looking at the landscape today relative to the fact that you are throwing of enormous amount of free cash flow, or we expect to?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lasan, thank you for the congratulations on the year. We are always looking at opportunities to buy assets or it may be assets or companies, we are no different than anyone else. But key thing that we have before us is to close the RBS transaction, so in fact that we can do a restructuring of our balance sheet and so that's primary on our focus and we are going to do that, and when we see a right opportunity come along that make sense for us in the space, we want to be in, we will be an active player.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Mark, you had mentioned that the capital infusion at the JV would probably have to increase by at least $100 million to $200 million it sounds like. Is that a physical cash injection or is that the amount of capital being returned would be reduced, how is that going to work?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I think they are one and the same, but let me make it clear that it's not something we have to do with, something that we know that we wanted to do may help us, it helps preserve our earnings and actually increases our earnings slightly because of the preferred return. It is... when these new regulations came out and with the high commodity pricing, the regulatory capital calculation was higher than what we had originally anticipated and we just sat down with our partners and worked out something that was equitable for both of us.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "So is it a cash infusion or is it a less cash return?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess it's less cash return. There's about 2 days difference between the two, so I am not sure it makes any difference.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. In terms of global liquefaction capacity, are you guys seeing any differently? It seems like this more announcements coming out about either for fraction capacity?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Neal, you want to address this?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think generally our view of this market is pretty consistent with the way we have seen it. There's a lot of liquefaction capacity going to be coming on in the next few years and that will have an impact on the market. But generally, our view around this global market has been positive and it continues to be so.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And any kind of thoughts on what Schneier announced recently about strategic review?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Neal, follow on with that.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Just consistent with what I just said. I think we don't generally comment on other companies, but essentially Schneier announcement came out, we looked at the company and looked at what the market resource saying about Schneier. And I think once again in general terms, when you look at the long-term for energy and the long-term for LNG, market has a pretty good view of Schneier and I think it reflects very well on the access that we hold.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And if I may, one last question, there is lot of discussion going on about building a REX equivalent to the West; Ruby and Bronco would do that and think of. How is that going to impact REX, is there going to be enough capacity out of the Rockies to feed both sides of the equation.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lasan, the reserve forecast we have... when we looked at building REX to the Eastern markets, there were adequate reserves there to support that project for 20 plus years and there have been reserve increases in the interim. So, no one would build a pipeline unless they felt comfortable about the reserves being there versus those which have been committed slightly, but yes, the reserves are in the Rockies to support a pipeline of project to the West.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "And why give them an opportunity to build and why don't you just take it away by building those spur on REX?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "If the opportunity present itself for us to do that, we would. We are looking at all the options that are out there with gas flowing to the west and we have made no decisions.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Operator", "Sir, your line is open.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Hi, can you hear me?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, go ahead.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, sorry about that. Wanted to touch basically first on the timing between the Fed approval and the actual close? You mentioned that you probably are going to be I guess the approval would have in March and it should actually close it in April?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes that's right.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's Mark Snell.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I... assuming that we get the Fed approval in the next few weeks, we would... our plan is to close it on April 1. We have been looking at trying to close it on the first of the month and made it easier for some things, but we are also exploring the possibility of closing at mid month.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "So it could happen earlier than April?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It could.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then in terms of Port Arthur, you guys I think have delayed due to the contracting situation there, the LNG development. And I was just wondering if you could sort of comment on that, what's your thoughts on in terms of the pricing environment that we are going to have to see in terms of the LNG outlook going forward in the U.S. the other market.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we had a discussion in the last call, maybe the call before that as you are aware we have gone forward and seek the expansion approval for both Costa Azul and for Cameron. So we now have the ability without launching Port Arthur to increase the capacity in our Mexican facility up to about 2.5 Bcf a day and about 2.6 Bcf at Cameron.", "And what we have done is we have left ourselves from little room to look at how the upstream market develops and if it made more sense to expand one of our existing facilities for incremental supply or to launch a whole new facility. So, we are very well positioned, we can expand in Mexico, we can expand in Cameron or we have permit some place where we can move forward with Port Arthur. So, I think it really is a function of how quickly the liquefaction market develops and how robust the market is in the U.S. to support the new LNG supplies. That's at the end of the day, we have as much flexibility as anybody out there to take advantage of what happens or what doesn't happen.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Right. So, I guess I am wondering when do you see that liquefaction market will show up and what kind of contracting are we looking at in terms of when we actually might see that development... that additional development to take place.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well let me just looking at the projects that are currently under construction, it looks like the water shed years are going be 2011 and later.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Right. And the contracting, I mean you would expect that to sort of develop, when do you think there will be a picture on the contract?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would think that as most of these projects get 18 months or so away from completion, that I would expect that upstream suppliers would start making sure they have a place to unload this someplace, whether it be in North America, Asia or Europe.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then finally, the level of non-investment grade on the trading book, it seems to have increased again over the quarter. Just elaborate a little bit more on the activity that is happening here in driving that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, do you want to take that?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. There really hasn't been... it's a relatively small difference and I think these are just things that happen from time-to-time. We really aren't noticing anything really different in our book of business, and frankly, if you are thinking that it might be a reflection of some of our customers being downgraded, that really hasn't happened yet with the majority of our customers. So I think from the most part, it's just a fluctuation that will probably correct itself over time.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks. My questions have been addressed.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Winfried Fruehauf with Fruehauf Consulting.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Good morning. My first question is on the allowance for funds used in construction. What was that amount in the fourth quarter and the year versus 2006?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hang on just a second, Winfried.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Thank you.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I want to get you... I want to give you the right answer so.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Winfried, why don't you go ahead and give me your second question and we'll --.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "All right. The second question relates to the large increase in short term debts year-over-year on your balance sheet to a little bit over $1 billion. What does that reflect and how you are going to refinance this large amount of short term debt?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That just reflects some of our current borrowings that we have taken down, one of those things that we have done is moved out of some of our commercial paper market and our and... notes that are long-term notes that re-price on a monthly basis we moved into more shorter term paper. But we have adequate, our credit lines if we don't end up going back into the bond market, we will just use our credit lines to finance that there are almost multiyear lines.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. What is your current estimate of the final construction cost for Costa Azul, given the cost of the nitrogen facility and some delay? And if you could please tell me whether that includes or excludes an allowance for funds used in construction?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I want to give this to Neal.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, at Costa Azul, we estimate that the final cost will be about $975 million. Now that includes capitalized interest and it excludes the nitrogen plant of $125 million and some pre-expansion cost of around $66 million.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. And next question is on Entrega, what was the net income contribution from Entrega in the fourth quarter?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "In the fourth quarter of?", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "2007, yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have that -- broken down?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, we won't disclose that.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, if I had, I couldn't give it to you.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "All right, okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And I don't. Let's go back to your first question. This is Neal.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I will cover. The AFQDC for the year for SDG&E equity was 17 for the year and SoCal was 5.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay and for the quarter?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "5 for SDG&A and 2 for SoCal.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Winfried.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", ": Hi, guys. Congrats on a good year. When we think about the incremental cost for REX, the $125 million to you. How does that impact your returns on invested capital on the project?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's negligible from the standpoint of the overall returns. I think it moves at few basis points.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "This time the numbers will move it kind of in proportion of the capital a little bit less so it's a very small impact.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", ": I mean, it's almost a 10% cost increase if I look at it from the overall project levels. I mean... how should we think about and... maybe I'll rephrase the question, what's the right... whether its ROE or ROIC target that investors should think about in terms for this projects?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Once again, when you look at the impact of this kind of a capital increase, it will move in more or less in kind of in proportion to the total capital. Now on an ROE basis, it should be a little bit less because of the impact of the leverage, but on ROA, return on absolute capital basis, that we've given particular forecast.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I understand. What's the ROE assumption for REX?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think we ever gave that.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And last question, and this is kind of touching based on the utilities a little bit, had a lot of utility related question today. How do we think about what the new generation needs are especially after the CPUC filings at the backend of the year '07 for San Diego Gas and Electric?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Debbie, you want to address that?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Sure, we have to... this is Debbie Reed, Michael. We have to file at the CPUC a 10 year long-term resource plan which was just basically approved by the CPUC that looks out on the generation needs going forward. And as Don mentioned in his remarks, not only do we have generation assets that are part of our portfolio today but we did receive approval to acquire El Dorado in 2011, and so we will have quite a bit of utility own generation as part of our portfolio. We will then add a compliment of peaking generation to meet our reliability and resource adequacy needs going forward, and that in addition to the Calpine plant that is under construction as well as our acquisition at El Dorado and in some peaking generation should meet our needs for the next 10 years or so.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "And if Sunrise is delayed, I think that 10 year procurements approval by the CPUC mentioned about another incremental 400 megawatts of capacity at Sunrises delay, where would that 400 come from?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Again, we would look at principally peaking generation and we would go through the required CPUC request for proposal process necessary to get down.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I got it. Okay, thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "We go next to Patrick Forkin with Tejas Security.", "Patrick Forkin - Tejas Security", "Good morning I was wondering if you could give us an update on your advanced metering program. Have you made the technology selection and what's your time table for regulatory approval?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Debbie Reed again.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Hi Patrick. We received regulatory approval for smart meter program last year and the CPUC authorized $572 million budget, $500 million of which approximately of capital. We will begin deployment of the first 5000 test meters in the second quarter of this year and then we will be again full deployment in Q4 of this year of all of the meters to be completed and installed in SDG&E service territory by early 2011 and that will be 1.4 million electric and 900,000 gas. We are still in negotiations with the vendor and so we are not at a point where we can release the name of the vendors that we have selected yet.", "Patrick Forkin - Tejas Security", "Okay, but on the core metering you have made a technology selection.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes.", "Patrick Forkin - Tejas Security", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Patrick.", "Operator", "We will go next to Peter Hark with Talon Capital.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Hello, Don and Mark. It's Peter Hark, how are you doing?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Peter, how are you?", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Very good. Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions on the RBS deal. First, could you review for us in more detail the factors that influenced your decision to revise the agreement in the first place? And is there a possibility that there will be further revisions coming. And lastly, is your increased capital contribution being matched by RBS also so that your respectable ownership interest are intact?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, well the decision, our partnership agreement that calls for a 15% preferred return on regulatory capital and so as we saw the numbers go up we decided that it would make more sense for us to put a little bit more -- to leave a little bit more money in the business. The couple of things that happened, because some of this was driven by higher commodity prices, we're actually... when we sell the business because we're essentially selling the kind of a book value, we are actually pulling a little more money out of the business and our cash flow from the businesses has been higher this year than we anticipated.", "So actually our net proceeds that are coming out are going to be roughly the same as what they would had been, what we have been anticipate earlier and just they would have been a little bit higher. And so it was pretty easy decision for us to make. We are still under the agreement limited on how much that we can be required to put in or how much we can... we may want to put in. So we don't expect to be... to see any further changes in that.", "And then long-term, we think partly this was relatively short-term issue with us. Then these new bank regulations drove some of the... I will refer to it as Basel II, which I think some of you might be familiar with and that have started to affect the European bank as of January 1st. And it will come into play here in the U.S. next January. That drove up some of the requirements, but under that Basel II requirements as well as the old requirements, we will be able to go to a far based model for determining regulatory capital instead of the formal lag model that happened before you can get your bar model approved. And once we do that, that will bring the capital back down again. So we are not... we are thinking the business more of a 12 to 15 months kind of issue and we will give the capital numbers back in balance where we thought we were a year from now.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Thank you, Mark, for explaining that and just to be clear then, RBS is not posting additional --?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am glad you brought that up, they will post about an equal amount more too, they will always, because the initial ownership percentage is 51.40, 49 they will always be just slightly more capital than us.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Okay, perfect. And then just also to be clear, is any of these being driven by either credit or collateral obligation?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it's really just is driven by the pure fact that commodity prices are higher so things like that requires more capital in the business and then the other part is like, like I said that these regulatory changes which until we... yes, we knew they were coming, but until we had worked through all of the numbers we really didn't know how they were going to turn out.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "I got you. Thanks. And then lastly, for clarification I think, answer to Jason's [ph] question. I think you said there was a two day difference in cap rating return, I am not sure, what you meant by that.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am sorry, I was probably was a little misleading. All I was really saying was that he was asking... Lasan was asking whether we were putting more money in or taking less money out and I said, this happens about the same time, it's hard to tell, which is which, but I think the net result is about the same.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much, Mark.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Peter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good afternoon.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Hi. Just one follow-up question on the RBS transaction. The profits will still get paid out at the end of every year, is that correct?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And assuming the transaction goes through, will you bring down the additional amount of your credit also.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And in the... can you discuss what happened to tax rate in the fourth quarter achieved relatively high compared to last?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The tax rate in the fourth quarter?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "That's right.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The fourth quarter was a little bit higher. That was partially because of the phase out of the Section 29 credit went up quite a bit and also we had lower income from lower tax jurisdictions during the quarter, just for the year it's about 34% in both years, next year we expect them to go up 3% because there are no Section 29.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And that was your householder.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Got you. And then in terms of your guidance, does that include any potential settlement discussions you are having with ISTG and inside CalGas?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It includes our best estimate of what the year is going to look like.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Fair enough. In terms of the cool-down cargoes you are receiving at Costa Azul, are those part... is that part of the capital that will be part of the investor capital in Costa Azul or is it?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think of it as working gas. It is like capital", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And any, given your operational in the second quarter other opportunities that you are looking at or potential spot cargoes given that there is a time difference between when your contracts ramp up, between what the facility comes on line?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there is.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And how are you guys looking at that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean the opportunity here is just as... just this aside, we were in a different meeting yesterday and had some people on the phone and it was interesting that we had LNG people all over the world and they're outselling capacity and looking for spot cargoes. So, as this facility goes operational and there is the ability to bring gas into it before the BP contract starts. We will be out there trying to convince people to bring it to Costa Azul.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Anyway to talk about the cost for MMBTU, the test cargoes cost?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would only say that we are paying market prices and as we went through the analysis of what these things are worth to us we can't start getting revenues from our customers until such times as we can prove that facilities commercial and you can't make it be it commercial and so you run test cargo through it so.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "One point on is that these test cargoes are part of the start up operation in their capitalized.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You were sleeping when we said that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Fair enough. On the Port Arthur, you guys talked about the open season for oil terminal capabilities, where are you guys at open season?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll have Neal address this but I just on the surplus we announced that in fact we are having an open season that was the end of last year and we had good response and we are in the process now of looking at those responders and seeing there is in fact there is enough interest to turn these into contracts to build terminaling.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Now this really is not in terms of the open season a lot to elaborate there, but I think it is worth underlining that both with respect to its possible uses in LNG terminal and with respect to its use at the possible oil terminal, the plot of land that we have down there is very well located, so long term this is going to be a very quality asset with a lot of potential.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And on the... at the generation segment, the outage of El Dorado I think it was a forced outage?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's started out as a planned outage and as we started the plan up it was a problem in the way it was put back together so it turned into a forced outage.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And did you guys talk about the impact from that forced outage on income?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You know it was negligible.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And then looking at the wind farm assets that you guys have under construction, where are you in terms of construction of those assets, the first phase and how is the second phase, third phase kind of looking?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think you're referencing the wind project that we have in Sempra generation.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "That's right. The 1000 megawatts potential wind capacity?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the status is as we've secured a good resource in terms of land and we've signed a contract with Southern California Edison. We have not started construction; we have two factors that are impeding that. One is as you're... I guess we all are painfully aware, we just don't have transmission in this region to move renewals to market and our project that we have in Mexico is a victim of that same outcome. So we are waiting for the transmission issues to get resolved. But beyond that, some of the equipment prices come in as planned will move forward once we have the transmission issues resolved.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And are you talking about having Sunrise Transmission via linked to those asset or is it versus --?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's Sunrise or some other transmission solution and our generation company is working both with the ISO and with the government of Mexico to see if we can find a transmission solution.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks for the time, guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow-up from Winfried Fruehauf with the Fruehauf Consulting Company.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Thank you. Regarding the Paloma outage, are you in anyway protected either by warranties and or insurance business interruption or insurance?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have a claim pending against people who did the repair work.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "And are you in a position to assess the chances of your succeeding?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if we didn't think we had a chance, we wouldn't waste our time filing it so.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Can you disclose the amount that you are claiming?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Not at this time.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow-up from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, just three quick follow-ups. How are sales of Argentine business going?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I didn't hear that, go ahead.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I am sorry, sales of the Argentine business?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "As you know, we're still trying to collect up on the claim that was awarded in our favor in Argentina, and so our plan there is to pursue a two courses of action. One is to dispose those assets in the market and secondly, collect from the claim against the government, and we are moving on both those.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then if I understood your comments on REX Northeast correctly, it sounds like there was enough interest in terms of people wanting to deserve capacity, so it sounds like it's coming down to negotiation of price, is that about the sum of it?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I guess I would maybe approach it a little differently, Lasan, as they were... I don't have a correct count here, but they were some between 8 and 12 projects that were one-time proposed that would basically take gas further east and they ended up in different locations, they carry different volumes. What we are doing is we're having discussions with the people that participate in our open season and we are as you know we're building a much larger pipeline that has a much lower rate, but requires much larger volumes to make it work. And we will see in the next couple of months whether or not there is enough market interest to have people sign up long-term contract to make this project to reality. I would say again that of all the people that are out there from the standpoint of those that have track record, have the creditability, have the team put together that we have a good... as good a shot as anybody in fact in extending this pipeline into the eastern markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then last question, Don, while ago, when we chatted you said the potential that Sempra may take a position in a liquefaction facility somewhere else, is that still kind of what you are looking for hoping for to achieve?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a space that we look that we bring some strengths to with our marketing capability, so as we're afforded opportunities to participate in liquefaction, the interest is not so much in just having equity in liquefaction, but having the marketing rights to go with it. And so in every case, we are looking at the opportunity to invest in liquefaction we're in fact we can have a disproportion share of the uptake to market.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take a follow-up from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Sorry, couple more question. What did you guys book in the year for your attrition filing, SoCalGas, SDG&E?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's Debbie Reed here.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes, in 2006 to 2007, our attrition was about $73 million to both utility.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, and then if I look at the operating income of both utilities over that timeframe, there was not that much growth in your operating profit number, so I assume that the attrition amount have been higher than O&M?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "There was actually a number of factors on the operating income side and we did in that having at SoCalGas a positive benefit from the attrition mechanism and a slight positive benefit at SDG&E last year and these were offset licensing like litigation costs in other item.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. But generally, the attrition amount seemed to be working in a way they were supposed to basically offsetting cost inflation overall of operation?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Absolutely, and we manage our costs based upon as we look ahead and we forecast what the attrition is going to be and we manage our business so that we can stay within that attrition amount.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "In terms of your other performance-based mechanisms, GCIM or other purchase gas costs... where you guys stand with that?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "If you look at all of our mechanisms for 2007, we had a total of $33 million pre-tax and $20 million after tax out of all of the incentive mechanisms from both utilities. That was about $10.6 million pre-tax at SoCalGas from PVR and GCIM 12 and then at SCG&E from the PVR was about $8.8 million pre-tax, a DSM incentive of $12 million and then PVR on the gas purchasing of about $2.3 million.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, I got you. Then last question on the equity earnings of certain of the subsidiaries underneath your pipeline storage segments. I think you have roughly $59 million for the year. Can I assume that a lot of that is related to your equity interest interact or is that something else?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's in ultimately South America too.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. Thanks", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Faisel.", "Operator", "With that we have no further questions in queue. At this time, I would like to turn conference back to Mr. Don Felsinger for closing remarks.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, once again, thanks to all of you for joining us for the 2007 earning call. If you have any follow-on questions, you have Jeff, Glen or Scott a call and if not, we will you see you end of March in New York. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference, ladies and gentleman.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Martin. Please go ahead sir.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Good afternoon. I would like to thank you for joining us to discuss Sempra Energy's 2007 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, President and CEO of Sempra Utilities, and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You will note that slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

Because we are holding it in New York City, there has been a lot of interest and we are hopeful that you will each make time to join us.", "And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Don who will begin with slide 3.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Jeff, and thanks to each of you for joining us. Here is how I would like to proceed with today's call. Mark Snell and I will start with the financial results, and I will update you on the status of our key business activities, and finally we will close with any questions that you may have.", "Before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to mention how pleased I am with the strength of our financial results. All of our operating businesses performed well for the quarter and for the full year. In fact, 2007 was a record year for income from continuing operations, all in all, a very good year and a great foundation for our future growth.", "Based on our outlook for the remainder of this year, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2008 earnings guidance of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. This guidance reflects the closing of the Royal Bank of Scotland transaction and our reduced ownership in Sempra Commodities and the positive impact of our planned share repurchase program.", "And with that, I am going to ask Mark to take you through the financial results in more detail.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Don. Well, earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $288 million or $1.10 per share. Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was $129 million or $0.49 per share. This included $221 million for the impairment of our Argentine assets.", "Net income for the fourth quarter was $289 million or $1.10 per share compared with net income in the prior year quarter of $125 million or $0.47 per share. Income from continuing operations increased to a record $1.13 billion or $4.26 per share for the full year 2007. That's up from $1.09 billion or $4.17 per share in 2006. Last year's results included $204 million in gains on asset sales and the Argentine write-down.", "Now let's review the financial results for each of our business units. I'll start with Sempra Utilities on slide 4. Sempra Utilities reported fourth quarter net income of $105 million, compared with the $110 million in the year ago period. San Diego Gas & Electric's net income for the fourth quarter was $47 million, that compares with $55 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower taxes in 2006.", "At Southern California Gas, fourth quarter 2007 net income was $58 million. That compares with $55 million in the prior year's quarter. For the full year 2007, Sempra Utilities reported net income of $513 million, a 12% increase over the $460 million posted in 06.", "Net income for SDG&E rose to $283 million in 2007 from $237 million in 2006. That was due primarily to favorable resolution of tax issues, together with higher electric transmission and generation earnings. 2000 (sic) [2007] net income for SoCalGas increased to $230 million from $223 million in 2006, due primarily to higher operating margins. Now let's go to slide 5.", "Sempra Commodities reported fourth quarter net income of $186 million in 2007, compared with $214 in the prior year's quarter. This is primarily due to reduced earnings from our natural gas and synthetic fuel tax credit operations. For the full year 2007, Sempra Commodities recorded net income of $499 million compared with 2006 earnings of $504 million.", "And with that, I'll also bring you a short update on our planned joint venture with RBS. We plan to close the transaction by April depending on the timing of our last regulatory approval. You'll recall that the transaction was approved by the FERC and the UK's Financial Services Authority last call, and we're now awaiting approval from the Federal Reserve Board which we expect in March.", "At this point, we don't envision any material issues and we believe we will receive Federal approval as previously mentioned by the end of the quarter. While we and RBS are disappointed that the approval process has taken longer than anticipated, there certainly has been some other significant issues in the financial markets that has taken up a lot of the regulators' time and attention.", "One change I would like to mention is that the amount of regulatory capital or equity of the commodities business required has increased over our original estimates. The change, this is driven by significant increases in commodity prices since the deal was first announced and recent changes in banking regulations.", "Considering this and the 15% preferred returns dictated by the partnership agreement, we requested and the partners agreed to increase our investment. As currently contemplated, Sempra will now invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion at closing. This increase from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion that we had originally contemplated, does not affect any other aspects of the transaction nor will it affect our planned stock buyback or dividend increase.", "And with respect to those, post closing we begin the first $1 billion of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion share repurchase program and again will raise our dividend. Earlier this month we raised our quarterly dividend 3.2% to $0.32 per share and we expect to increase the quarterly dividend the second time to $0.35 a share once we close the transaction. This will reflect the 35% to 40% payout ratio at an annual rate of $1.40 per share.", "Now we will move onto slide 6. Fourth quarter net income for our generation business was $40 million compared with $53 million in the same quarter in 2006, due primarily to a 3 month outage of the company's El Dorado Energy plant in Nevada and higher taxes. The El Dorado plant was placed back in service on January 7th of this year.", "For the full year 2007, net income for Sempra Generation was $162 million compared with $375 million in 2006, which included $204 million related to the sale of the Topaz Power plant.", "Now please move to slide 7. In the fourth quarter, 2007 Sempra Pipelines & Storage reported net income of $14 million compared with a net loss of $223 million in the same period in 2006. Fourth quarter 2006 results included a $221 million write-down on the company's Argentine Utility investments, together with $24 million in taxes on repatriated foreign earnings.", "For the full year of 2007, net income was $64 million compared with net loss of $165 million in 2006. The prior year results included the previously mentioned write-down and taxes on repatriation offset by $10 million from the favorable resolution of prior year tax issues.", "Please turn to slide 8. This slide provides the summary of our business unit results, and I'll highlight a few points and I will start with our LNG business. Sempra LNG recorded a net loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter of '07, that's compared with a net loss of $7 million in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to a mark-to-market loss on a marketing agreement with Sempra Commodities where this loss was offset by a corresponding gain.", "Parent and other reported a net loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with a net loss of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily due to increased charitable contributions and income taxes.", "Please turn to slide 9. We are very pleased with our 2007 results. Income from continuing operations set a new record for the company and our financial results were bolstered by strong earnings from our California Utilities and Sempra Commodities. Second, we continue to have a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity with over $650 million of cash on hand and $5 billion in unused credit line.", "We also finished the year with a debt-to-total cap ratio of 39%, a 3% drop from 2006. That's noteworthy, because as we close the RBS transaction, we've made the commitment to restructure our balance sheet by repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, both of which will directly benefit shareholders.", "Now I would like to turn it back to Don, with slide 10.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark. Let me start with a short business update beginning with our utilities. In December, SDG&A received a final decision on its cost of capital proceeding which increased its authorized return on equity to 11.1% from 10.7%. This increase was effective on January 1st. You will also recall that last year the FERC increased our authorized return on equity on transmission assets to 11.35%.", "In regard to our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, we reached settlements on major aspects of those proceedings. We now expect a final decision from the California Public Utilities Commission in the second quarter of this year, and we have filed for rates to be retroactive to January 1st of this year.", "In November, SDG&E's purchase of Sempra Generation's El Dorado power plant was approved by the CPUC. The purchase will be effective in late 2011. As for the Sunrise Powerlink 500 KV transmission project, we received a draft environmental impact study last month which is an important project milestone. We expect a final decision on the project in the second half of this year which would result in the line being placed into service in 2011.", "Now let me update you on our LNG business on slide 11. Our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul terminal will begin operations in the second quarter. While the revised start date is a couple of month later than expected, the net income impact of this delay is negligible. As you would expect, there is lot of excitement about placing into service the first LNG receipt terminal on the West Coast of North America. We secured initial test cargos for the commissioning and completed the connecting pipeline. At the end of 2007, we also finalized an agreement to develop the $125 million nitrogen injection facility at the terminal. As many of you know, California has adopted some of the most stringent gas quality specifications in the country. This new nitrogen facility will allow gas from the expanded number of sources around the world to meet these more stringent specifications.", "Recently an affirmation of our LNG strategy was reiterated by FERC Chairman, Kelliher, who forecasted that the U.S. will become the largest LNG importer by 2011, due to heating and natural gas fuel generation growth. Chairman, Kelliher also said that our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul project is very important because with its commissioning, the U.S. will be the only LNG importer with ready access to both the Atlantic and Pacific markets. This will make the U.S. market increasingly attractive to LNG importers. In Louisiana, our Cameron receipt facility is 75% complete. This project remains on track for operations in early 2009 and we are still focused on contracting the remainder of capacity at Cameron.", "Now let's move to slide 12, for an update on pipelines and storage and the Rockies Express pipeline project. A major milestone occurred in January when we began interim service on the 500 mile segment of the Rockies Express west portion of the pipeline that runs from Colorado to Kansas. We expect the entire 700 mile western portion of the pipeline which ends in Missouri to be in full service next month. As for Rockies Express East, we are continuing to work closely with the FERC on permitting and expect to receive approval sometime in the spring. This will enable us to start construction in early summer and need a December 2008 interim service date.", "The total cost of the Rockies Express pipeline is now estimated to be $4.9 billion, an increase of $500 million from the original estimate. Sempra Energy's 25% share of the overall project cost is roughly $1.2 billion. As many of you know, there continues to be a lot of interest in a follow on project to the Rockies Express Pipeline that would deliver natural gas to markets further east.", "Late last year, we completed an open season for the Northeast Express Pipeline project that would extend service from Clarington, Ohio to Princeton, New Jersey. We are now negotiating with interested parties for firm contracts with a view towards making a final decision on the project sometime in the next quarter.", "Please turn now to slide 13. In summary, here is a couple of key highlights. First, all of our businesses units have performed well. 2007 saw record income from continuing operations, driven in large part by a strong year from our California utilities and our commodities business. In addition, we have some important milestones taking place this year. The closing of our joint venture with RBS, the conclusion of our general rate cases, REX-West is now flowing gas, we are commissioning our Costa Azul receipt facility in the second quarter and we have several more major projects coming online this year, an exciting time as many of our projects and activities move into the operations and earnings phase.", "With that, our outlook for 2008 has a lot of certainty and we reaffirm our earnings guidance with a range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. In 2009, we will be seeing the first full year of operations for many of the projects I just discussed, and that will be reflected in significantly stronger earnings growth in the future. We'll get into the detail behind that growth at our Analyst Conference coming up in March.", "And with that, let me now open up the call and take any questions that you might have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", ": Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from John Kiani with Deutsche Bank.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "I know you made some comments earlier on in your discussion about the RBS commodities joint venture. Can you talk a little about any... did you had any recent discussion with RBS or with the U.S. Fed?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me have Mark answer your question, but we are in contact with RBS almost on a daily basis and just to want to reaffirm to you that we expect this transaction to close here within a month.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", ": Yes, John this is Mark, I think the transaction took a little longer to close than we had anticipated, but I don't think could have anticipated the kind of financial turmoil.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Right.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", ": That the regulators have been at and you know I want to say that I think it's on... in my conversations with them, they are being diligent and they are really trying to get this done, trying to get the attention of all of the people that they need to get. It's been understandably difficult and I think this just took longer than they expected as well and so... but we are getting there and I think we'll... we expect to get that this month and we expect to close shortly thereafter.", "And as far as the conversations we have with RBS, they are meeting with us on a daily basis. We are working to integrate the two businesses and I think from the get go we're going to be ready to move forward.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks, that's helpful. And then can you talk a little bit about this gas-fired power plant that you have in early stage development in Maryland. I think I saw something for around 500 or 600 megawatts?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We had a site in Maryland for a number of years that we have not developed because the market hasn't given us the right price signals. And as we look at what's taking place right now on PJM and the fact that they've gone out for capacity payments in 2011. If in fact these capacity payments get approved by the FERC, which we think they will and we're able to deal with some local issues regarding taxes and get our construction cost at a point that they make sense to us, it's a project we will move forward with. But there is still a few open items, but it looks very positive from the standpoint of what we're seeing today.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "So just to be clear, it sounds like your expectation is that the new and higher corn prices are approved and therefore we might continue to see pretty robust PJM capacity pricing and specifically in the region in which you have sub region where you have the site and if that's the case, you very well may push forward with this development?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think as you watch construction cost for new combined cycle, we're seeing cost in a range now of $900 to $1000 of megawatt or KW. When we look at what's happening in PJM, is they need capacity and we think the prices that they have adopted and they sent to the FERC to get approved would in fact support new generation. We also think we have one of the few sites that's ready to be built upon and meet the 2011 date. So, once again, if the prices get approved by the FERC and we are able to get our construction cost estimates coming into the price range that supports our economics and deal one or two the minor issues, it's a project that in fact we will move forward with.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Don, first of all, congratulations on a good year, but more kind of looking out globally, I can't imagine you seeing back and saying to yourself, there are no acquisition opportunities on the horizon... or in the mixed today that you are looking out and I can probably give you three companies that might be of interest to you. How you kind of looking at the landscape today relative to the fact that you are throwing of enormous amount of free cash flow, or we expect to?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lasan, thank you for the congratulations on the year. We are always looking at opportunities to buy assets or it may be assets or companies, we are no different than anyone else. But key thing that we have before us is to close the RBS transaction, so in fact that we can do a restructuring of our balance sheet and so that's primary on our focus and we are going to do that, and when we see a right opportunity come along that make sense for us in the space, we want to be in, we will be an active player.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Mark, you had mentioned that the capital infusion at the JV would probably have to increase by at least $100 million to $200 million it sounds like. Is that a physical cash injection or is that the amount of capital being returned would be reduced, how is that going to work?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I think they are one and the same, but let me make it clear that it's not something we have to do with, something that we know that we wanted to do may help us, it helps preserve our earnings and actually increases our earnings slightly because of the preferred return. It is... when these new regulations came out and with the high commodity pricing, the regulatory capital calculation was higher than what we had originally anticipated and we just sat down with our partners and worked out something that was equitable for both of us.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "So is it a cash infusion or is it a less cash return?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess it's less cash return. There's about 2 days difference between the two, so I am not sure it makes any difference.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. In terms of global liquefaction capacity, are you guys seeing any differently? It seems like this more announcements coming out about either for fraction capacity?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Neal, you want to address this?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think generally our view of this market is pretty consistent with the way we have seen it. There's a lot of liquefaction capacity going to be coming on in the next few years and that will have an impact on the market. But generally, our view around this global market has been positive and it continues to be so.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And any kind of thoughts on what Schneier announced recently about strategic review?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Neal, follow on with that.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Just consistent with what I just said. I think we don't generally comment on other companies, but essentially Schneier announcement came out, we looked at the company and looked at what the market resource saying about Schneier. And I think once again in general terms, when you look at the long-term for energy and the long-term for LNG, market has a pretty good view of Schneier and I think it reflects very well on the access that we hold.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And if I may, one last question, there is lot of discussion going on about building a REX equivalent to the West; Ruby and Bronco would do that and think of. How is that going to impact REX, is there going to be enough capacity out of the Rockies to feed both sides of the equation.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lasan, the reserve forecast we have... when we looked at building REX to the Eastern markets, there were adequate reserves there to support that project for 20 plus years and there have been reserve increases in the interim. So, no one would build a pipeline unless they felt comfortable about the reserves being there versus those which have been committed slightly, but yes, the reserves are in the Rockies to support a pipeline of project to the West.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "And why give them an opportunity to build and why don't you just take it away by building those spur on REX?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "If the opportunity present itself for us to do that, we would. We are looking at all the options that are out there with gas flowing to the west and we have made no decisions.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Operator", "Sir, your line is open.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Hi, can you hear me?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, go ahead.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, sorry about that. Wanted to touch basically first on the timing between the Fed approval and the actual close? You mentioned that you probably are going to be I guess the approval would have in March and it should actually close it in April?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes that's right.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's Mark Snell.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I... assuming that we get the Fed approval in the next few weeks, we would... our plan is to close it on April 1. We have been looking at trying to close it on the first of the month and made it easier for some things, but we are also exploring the possibility of closing at mid month.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "So it could happen earlier than April?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It could.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then in terms of Port Arthur, you guys I think have delayed due to the contracting situation there, the LNG development. And I was just wondering if you could sort of comment on that, what's your thoughts on in terms of the pricing environment that we are going to have to see in terms of the LNG outlook going forward in the U.S. the other market.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we had a discussion in the last call, maybe the call before that as you are aware we have gone forward and seek the expansion approval for both Costa Azul and for Cameron. So we now have the ability without launching Port Arthur to increase the capacity in our Mexican facility up to about 2.5 Bcf a day and about 2.6 Bcf at Cameron.", "And what we have done is we have left ourselves from little room to look at how the upstream market develops and if it made more sense to expand one of our existing facilities for incremental supply or to launch a whole new facility. So, we are very well positioned, we can expand in Mexico, we can expand in Cameron or we have permit some place where we can move forward with Port Arthur. So, I think it really is a function of how quickly the liquefaction market develops and how robust the market is in the U.S. to support the new LNG supplies. That's at the end of the day, we have as much flexibility as anybody out there to take advantage of what happens or what doesn't happen.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Right. So, I guess I am wondering when do you see that liquefaction market will show up and what kind of contracting are we looking at in terms of when we actually might see that development... that additional development to take place.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well let me just looking at the projects that are currently under construction, it looks like the water shed years are going be 2011 and later.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Right. And the contracting, I mean you would expect that to sort of develop, when do you think there will be a picture on the contract?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would think that as most of these projects get 18 months or so away from completion, that I would expect that upstream suppliers would start making sure they have a place to unload this someplace, whether it be in North America, Asia or Europe.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then finally, the level of non-investment grade on the trading book, it seems to have increased again over the quarter. Just elaborate a little bit more on the activity that is happening here in driving that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, do you want to take that?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. There really hasn't been... it's a relatively small difference and I think these are just things that happen from time-to-time. We really aren't noticing anything really different in our book of business, and frankly, if you are thinking that it might be a reflection of some of our customers being downgraded, that really hasn't happened yet with the majority of our customers. So I think from the most part, it's just a fluctuation that will probably correct itself over time.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks. My questions have been addressed.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Winfried Fruehauf with Fruehauf Consulting.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Good morning. My first question is on the allowance for funds used in construction. What was that amount in the fourth quarter and the year versus 2006?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hang on just a second, Winfried.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Thank you.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I want to get you... I want to give you the right answer so.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Winfried, why don't you go ahead and give me your second question and we'll --.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "All right. The second question relates to the large increase in short term debts year-over-year on your balance sheet to a little bit over $1 billion. What does that reflect and how you are going to refinance this large amount of short term debt?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That just reflects some of our current borrowings that we have taken down, one of those things that we have done is moved out of some of our commercial paper market and our and... notes that are long-term notes that re-price on a monthly basis we moved into more shorter term paper. But we have adequate, our credit lines if we don't end up going back into the bond market, we will just use our credit lines to finance that there are almost multiyear lines.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. What is your current estimate of the final construction cost for Costa Azul, given the cost of the nitrogen facility and some delay? And if you could please tell me whether that includes or excludes an allowance for funds used in construction?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I want to give this to Neal.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, at Costa Azul, we estimate that the final cost will be about $975 million. Now that includes capitalized interest and it excludes the nitrogen plant of $125 million and some pre-expansion cost of around $66 million.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. And next question is on Entrega, what was the net income contribution from Entrega in the fourth quarter?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "In the fourth quarter of?", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "2007, yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have that -- broken down?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, we won't disclose that.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, if I had, I couldn't give it to you.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "All right, okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And I don't. Let's go back to your first question. This is Neal.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I will cover. The AFQDC for the year for SDG&E equity was 17 for the year and SoCal was 5.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay and for the quarter?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "5 for SDG&A and 2 for SoCal.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Winfried.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", ": Hi, guys. Congrats on a good year. When we think about the incremental cost for REX, the $125 million to you. How does that impact your returns on invested capital on the project?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's negligible from the standpoint of the overall returns. I think it moves at few basis points.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "This time the numbers will move it kind of in proportion of the capital a little bit less so it's a very small impact.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", ": I mean, it's almost a 10% cost increase if I look at it from the overall project levels. I mean... how should we think about and... maybe I'll rephrase the question, what's the right... whether its ROE or ROIC target that investors should think about in terms for this projects?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Once again, when you look at the impact of this kind of a capital increase, it will move in more or less in kind of in proportion to the total capital. Now on an ROE basis, it should be a little bit less because of the impact of the leverage, but on ROA, return on absolute capital basis, that we've given particular forecast.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I understand. What's the ROE assumption for REX?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think we ever gave that.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And last question, and this is kind of touching based on the utilities a little bit, had a lot of utility related question today. How do we think about what the new generation needs are especially after the CPUC filings at the backend of the year '07 for San Diego Gas and Electric?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Debbie, you want to address that?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Sure, we have to... this is Debbie Reed, Michael. We have to file at the CPUC a 10 year long-term resource plan which was just basically approved by the CPUC that looks out on the generation needs going forward. And as Don mentioned in his remarks, not only do we have generation assets that are part of our portfolio today but we did receive approval to acquire El Dorado in 2011, and so we will have quite a bit of utility own generation as part of our portfolio. We will then add a compliment of peaking generation to meet our reliability and resource adequacy needs going forward, and that in addition to the Calpine plant that is under construction as well as our acquisition at El Dorado and in some peaking generation should meet our needs for the next 10 years or so.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "And if Sunrise is delayed, I think that 10 year procurements approval by the CPUC mentioned about another incremental 400 megawatts of capacity at Sunrises delay, where would that 400 come from?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Again, we would look at principally peaking generation and we would go through the required CPUC request for proposal process necessary to get down.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I got it. Okay, thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "We go next to Patrick Forkin with Tejas Security.", "Patrick Forkin - Tejas Security", "Good morning I was wondering if you could give us an update on your advanced metering program. Have you made the technology selection and what's your time table for regulatory approval?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Debbie Reed again.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Hi Patrick. We received regulatory approval for smart meter program last year and the CPUC authorized $572 million budget, $500 million of which approximately of capital. We will begin deployment of the first 5000 test meters in the second quarter of this year and then we will be again full deployment in Q4 of this year of all of the meters to be completed and installed in SDG&E service territory by early 2011 and that will be 1.4 million electric and 900,000 gas. We are still in negotiations with the vendor and so we are not at a point where we can release the name of the vendors that we have selected yet.", "Patrick Forkin - Tejas Security", "Okay, but on the core metering you have made a technology selection.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes.", "Patrick Forkin - Tejas Security", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Patrick.", "Operator", "We will go next to Peter Hark with Talon Capital.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Hello, Don and Mark. It's Peter Hark, how are you doing?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Peter, how are you?", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Very good. Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions on the RBS deal. First, could you review for us in more detail the factors that influenced your decision to revise the agreement in the first place? And is there a possibility that there will be further revisions coming. And lastly, is your increased capital contribution being matched by RBS also so that your respectable ownership interest are intact?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, well the decision, our partnership agreement that calls for a 15% preferred return on regulatory capital and so as we saw the numbers go up we decided that it would make more sense for us to put a little bit more -- to leave a little bit more money in the business. The couple of things that happened, because some of this was driven by higher commodity prices, we're actually... when we sell the business because we're essentially selling the kind of a book value, we are actually pulling a little more money out of the business and our cash flow from the businesses has been higher this year than we anticipated.", "So actually our net proceeds that are coming out are going to be roughly the same as what they would had been, what we have been anticipate earlier and just they would have been a little bit higher. And so it was pretty easy decision for us to make. We are still under the agreement limited on how much that we can be required to put in or how much we can... we may want to put in. So we don't expect to be... to see any further changes in that.", "And then long-term, we think partly this was relatively short-term issue with us. Then these new bank regulations drove some of the... I will refer to it as Basel II, which I think some of you might be familiar with and that have started to affect the European bank as of January 1st. And it will come into play here in the U.S. next January. That drove up some of the requirements, but under that Basel II requirements as well as the old requirements, we will be able to go to a far based model for determining regulatory capital instead of the formal lag model that happened before you can get your bar model approved. And once we do that, that will bring the capital back down again. So we are not... we are thinking the business more of a 12 to 15 months kind of issue and we will give the capital numbers back in balance where we thought we were a year from now.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Thank you, Mark, for explaining that and just to be clear then, RBS is not posting additional --?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am glad you brought that up, they will post about an equal amount more too, they will always, because the initial ownership percentage is 51.40, 49 they will always be just slightly more capital than us.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Okay, perfect. And then just also to be clear, is any of these being driven by either credit or collateral obligation?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it's really just is driven by the pure fact that commodity prices are higher so things like that requires more capital in the business and then the other part is like, like I said that these regulatory changes which until we... yes, we knew they were coming, but until we had worked through all of the numbers we really didn't know how they were going to turn out.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "I got you. Thanks. And then lastly, for clarification I think, answer to Jason's [ph] question. I think you said there was a two day difference in cap rating return, I am not sure, what you meant by that.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am sorry, I was probably was a little misleading. All I was really saying was that he was asking... Lasan was asking whether we were putting more money in or taking less money out and I said, this happens about the same time, it's hard to tell, which is which, but I think the net result is about the same.", "Peter Hark - Talon Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much, Mark.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Peter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good afternoon.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Hi. Just one follow-up question on the RBS transaction. The profits will still get paid out at the end of every year, is that correct?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And assuming the transaction goes through, will you bring down the additional amount of your credit also.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And in the... can you discuss what happened to tax rate in the fourth quarter achieved relatively high compared to last?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The tax rate in the fourth quarter?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "That's right.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The fourth quarter was a little bit higher. That was partially because of the phase out of the Section 29 credit went up quite a bit and also we had lower income from lower tax jurisdictions during the quarter, just for the year it's about 34% in both years, next year we expect them to go up 3% because there are no Section 29.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And that was your householder.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Got you. And then in terms of your guidance, does that include any potential settlement discussions you are having with ISTG and inside CalGas?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It includes our best estimate of what the year is going to look like.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Fair enough. In terms of the cool-down cargoes you are receiving at Costa Azul, are those part... is that part of the capital that will be part of the investor capital in Costa Azul or is it?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think of it as working gas. It is like capital", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And any, given your operational in the second quarter other opportunities that you are looking at or potential spot cargoes given that there is a time difference between when your contracts ramp up, between what the facility comes on line?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there is.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And how are you guys looking at that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean the opportunity here is just as... just this aside, we were in a different meeting yesterday and had some people on the phone and it was interesting that we had LNG people all over the world and they're outselling capacity and looking for spot cargoes. So, as this facility goes operational and there is the ability to bring gas into it before the BP contract starts. We will be out there trying to convince people to bring it to Costa Azul.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Anyway to talk about the cost for MMBTU, the test cargoes cost?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would only say that we are paying market prices and as we went through the analysis of what these things are worth to us we can't start getting revenues from our customers until such times as we can prove that facilities commercial and you can't make it be it commercial and so you run test cargo through it so.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "One point on is that these test cargoes are part of the start up operation in their capitalized.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You were sleeping when we said that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Fair enough. On the Port Arthur, you guys talked about the open season for oil terminal capabilities, where are you guys at open season?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll have Neal address this but I just on the surplus we announced that in fact we are having an open season that was the end of last year and we had good response and we are in the process now of looking at those responders and seeing there is in fact there is enough interest to turn these into contracts to build terminaling.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Now this really is not in terms of the open season a lot to elaborate there, but I think it is worth underlining that both with respect to its possible uses in LNG terminal and with respect to its use at the possible oil terminal, the plot of land that we have down there is very well located, so long term this is going to be a very quality asset with a lot of potential.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And on the... at the generation segment, the outage of El Dorado I think it was a forced outage?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's started out as a planned outage and as we started the plan up it was a problem in the way it was put back together so it turned into a forced outage.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And did you guys talk about the impact from that forced outage on income?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You know it was negligible.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And then looking at the wind farm assets that you guys have under construction, where are you in terms of construction of those assets, the first phase and how is the second phase, third phase kind of looking?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think you're referencing the wind project that we have in Sempra generation.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "That's right. The 1000 megawatts potential wind capacity?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the status is as we've secured a good resource in terms of land and we've signed a contract with Southern California Edison. We have not started construction; we have two factors that are impeding that. One is as you're... I guess we all are painfully aware, we just don't have transmission in this region to move renewals to market and our project that we have in Mexico is a victim of that same outcome. So we are waiting for the transmission issues to get resolved. But beyond that, some of the equipment prices come in as planned will move forward once we have the transmission issues resolved.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And are you talking about having Sunrise Transmission via linked to those asset or is it versus --?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's Sunrise or some other transmission solution and our generation company is working both with the ISO and with the government of Mexico to see if we can find a transmission solution.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks for the time, guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow-up from Winfried Fruehauf with the Fruehauf Consulting Company.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Thank you. Regarding the Paloma outage, are you in anyway protected either by warranties and or insurance business interruption or insurance?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have a claim pending against people who did the repair work.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "And are you in a position to assess the chances of your succeeding?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if we didn't think we had a chance, we wouldn't waste our time filing it so.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Can you disclose the amount that you are claiming?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Not at this time.", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting", "Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow-up from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, just three quick follow-ups. How are sales of Argentine business going?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I didn't hear that, go ahead.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I am sorry, sales of the Argentine business?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "As you know, we're still trying to collect up on the claim that was awarded in our favor in Argentina, and so our plan there is to pursue a two courses of action. One is to dispose those assets in the market and secondly, collect from the claim against the government, and we are moving on both those.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then if I understood your comments on REX Northeast correctly, it sounds like there was enough interest in terms of people wanting to deserve capacity, so it sounds like it's coming down to negotiation of price, is that about the sum of it?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I guess I would maybe approach it a little differently, Lasan, as they were... I don't have a correct count here, but they were some between 8 and 12 projects that were one-time proposed that would basically take gas further east and they ended up in different locations, they carry different volumes. What we are doing is we're having discussions with the people that participate in our open season and we are as you know we're building a much larger pipeline that has a much lower rate, but requires much larger volumes to make it work. And we will see in the next couple of months whether or not there is enough market interest to have people sign up long-term contract to make this project to reality. I would say again that of all the people that are out there from the standpoint of those that have track record, have the creditability, have the team put together that we have a good... as good a shot as anybody in fact in extending this pipeline into the eastern markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then last question, Don, while ago, when we chatted you said the potential that Sempra may take a position in a liquefaction facility somewhere else, is that still kind of what you are looking for hoping for to achieve?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a space that we look that we bring some strengths to with our marketing capability, so as we're afforded opportunities to participate in liquefaction, the interest is not so much in just having equity in liquefaction, but having the marketing rights to go with it. And so in every case, we are looking at the opportunity to invest in liquefaction we're in fact we can have a disproportion share of the uptake to market.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take a follow-up from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Sorry, couple more question. What did you guys book in the year for your attrition filing, SoCalGas, SDG&E?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's Debbie Reed here.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes, in 2006 to 2007, our attrition was about $73 million to both utility.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, and then if I look at the operating income of both utilities over that timeframe, there was not that much growth in your operating profit number, so I assume that the attrition amount have been higher than O&M?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "There was actually a number of factors on the operating income side and we did in that having at SoCalGas a positive benefit from the attrition mechanism and a slight positive benefit at SDG&E last year and these were offset licensing like litigation costs in other item.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. But generally, the attrition amount seemed to be working in a way they were supposed to basically offsetting cost inflation overall of operation?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Absolutely, and we manage our costs based upon as we look ahead and we forecast what the attrition is going to be and we manage our business so that we can stay within that attrition amount.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "In terms of your other performance-based mechanisms, GCIM or other purchase gas costs... where you guys stand with that?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "If you look at all of our mechanisms for 2007, we had a total of $33 million pre-tax and $20 million after tax out of all of the incentive mechanisms from both utilities. That was about $10.6 million pre-tax at SoCalGas from PVR and GCIM 12 and then at SCG&E from the PVR was about $8.8 million pre-tax, a DSM incentive of $12 million and then PVR on the gas purchasing of about $2.3 million.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, I got you. Then last question on the equity earnings of certain of the subsidiaries underneath your pipeline storage segments. I think you have roughly $59 million for the year. Can I assume that a lot of that is related to your equity interest interact or is that something else?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's in ultimately South America too.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. Thanks", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Faisel.", "Operator", "With that we have no further questions in queue. At this time, I would like to turn conference back to Mr. Don Felsinger for closing remarks.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, once again, thanks to all of you for joining us for the 2007 earning call. If you have any follow-on questions, you have Jeff, Glen or Scott a call and if not, we will you see you end of March in New York. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference, ladies and gentleman.

Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I would like now to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Martin. Please go ahead sir.", "Jeff Martin - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good afternoon. I'm Jeff Martin; I would like to thank you for joining us to discuss Sempra Energy's first quarter 2008 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website, under the Investor section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, President and CEO of Sempra Utilities; and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You will note that slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

In those cases, we will reconcile those financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP figures and the reconciliations will be attached as appendices to our slide presentation. In addition it's also important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation today are shown on a diluted basis.", "And with that, I would like to turn it over to Don, who will begin with slide 3.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Jeff. And thanks to you for joining us on this Friday. Here's how I would like to proceed with today's call. First, Mark Snell and I will start with financial results, than I'll update you on the status of our key business activities and finally we will close with any questions that you may have.", "I would like to briefly update you on several things that have been... that have occurred since our February earnings call. First of all, we held our analyst conference in New York in March. At the conference we presented our 2008 to 2012 financial plan which increased our long-term EPS growth rate to 11%. Based on our earnings forecast and our new target of 35% to 40% payout ratio, our dividend is expected to grow on average 12% a year, more than tripling our previous target of 3% to 4% annual growth.", "Also the majority of our earnings are expected to come from long-term contracts and our regulated utilities as well as from the preferred return we'll receive from our new joint venture with RBS. All of this is important because it means our earnings are becoming increasingly more predictable than in the past.", "The balance of slide 3 shows our recent accomplishments. I'll get into more detail on these later on the call. Let's now go to slide 4 for financial results.", "We had a strong first quarter with each of our operating businesses performing well. We also had income contribution for the first time from Rockies Express West which you will recall began service in January. These factors help improve our EPS by 7% over the previous year's quarter. We saw an even stronger improvement in EBITDA, up 17%. All-in-all a great start for 2008 putting us on track to achieve our targets for the remainder of the year.", "And with that I'm going to ask Mark to take you through the financial results in more detail.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Don. Earlier this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million or $0.92 per share; up from first quarter 2007 net income of $228 million or $0.86 per share. Don alluded to it earlier, but the key takeaway for the quarter is the continued strength we're seeing across all of our businesses. As I go through the slide, I'll make a point to call out some of the areas of notable improvement starting with Sempra Utilities on slide 5.", "Sempra Utilities first quarter 2008 net income increased 12% to $131 million from $117 million in the year ago period. San Diego Gas & Electric's net income for the first quarter improved to $74 million compared with $62 million in the year ago quarter. 2008 results include $9 million of favorable tax adjustments. At Southern California Gas first quarter 2008 net income was $57 million, up from $55 million in the prior year quarter. It's important to note that first quarter 2008 revenues for both utilities do not include the anticipated increase from pending general rate case settlements.", "Now, let's go to slide 6, Sempra Commodities reported first quarter net income of $59 million in 2008 compared with $71 million in the prior year quarter. Since the RBS transaction didn't close until April 1st, first quarter 2008 results represent 100% of Commodities earnings. Now, Commodities did see improved margins in the quarter led by our North American power segment. However, during the quarter, commodities took $17 million write down related to an issue with the mining counterparty.", "We have terminated our contracts with that counterparty and our remaining net exposure is less than $5 million. First quarter 2007 results included an $18 million benefit from the gain on sale of equity investments.", "Now, let's move to slide 7. First quarter net income for our generation business was $45 million compared with $54 million in the same quarter in 2007. First quarter 2007 results were positively impacted by $6 million mark-to-market gain on long-term hedges with Sempra Commodities and other counterparties. 2007 results also benefited from $4 million of intercompany interest income.", "Please move to slide 8. In the first quarter of 2008 Sempra Pipelines & Storage reported net income of $26 million compared with $16 million in the same period in 2007. The new Rockies Express West pipeline, which went into service in January, contributed $5 million of earnings in the quarter. 2008 also benefited from favorable foreign exchange rate effects on our investments in Chile and Peru and some improved operations.", "Now please turn to slide 9, this slide provides the summary of our business unit result and I will highlight a few points starting with our LNG business. Sempra LNG recorded a net loss of $9 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared with a net loss of $10 million in the prior year period. The decrease in loss was primarily due to $10 million after-tax cash payment we received. This was the result of an early termination of a capacity agreement at our Cameron LNG terminal.", "That benefit was offset by $6 million in higher income tax expense related to Mexican currency adjustments and some mark-to-market losses on our marketing agreement. All other items totaled to net loss of $10 million in first quarter of 2008 compared with a net loss of $21 million in the first quarter of 2007, primarily due to reduced net interest expense.", "Now let's turn to slide 10, we are very pleased with the start of the year. Earnings per share and EBITDA improved significantly, all largely driven by our California Utilities and Pipeline segment. We closed the RBS transaction in April and began repurchasing the first $1 billion of our common stock as part of our planned $1.5 billion to $2 billion repurchase program. We expect to complete the first $1 billion of our repurchase program in the fourth quarter. We also increased our quarterly dividend 3% in the first quarter, and expect our Board to increase it another 9% to $0.35 per share for the next dividend payable in July.", "Now I'll turn it back to Don with slide 11.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark. Let me start with a short business update beginning with our utilities. With regard to our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, we've reached settlements on major aspects of those proceedings late last year. Some key aspects of those settlements include $197 million revenue increase in the first year with fixed escalations in the following year averaging $96 million per year.", "Under the settlement, it's also important to note that we're not affected by changes in our customer base or productivity gains and there is no earning sharing. We now expect to receive the final decision from the California Public Utilities Commission later this quarter. We filed for rates to be retroactive to January 1st of this year.", "Our $500 million smart meter program at SDG&E will begin the initial phase of installations this quarter. Large scale installations will begin in 2009 with completion in 2011.", "Also we're currently evaluating the installation of natural gas smart meters in the SoCalGas territory. We plan to file an application with the CPUC later this year with a decision anticipated in the second half of 2009.", "Regarding the Sunrise transmission project, in the first quarter, we received a draft environmental impact study. We expect a final decision on the project by yearend which would result in the line being placed into service in 2011.", "Now let me update you one our LNG business on slide 12. At our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul terminal we received our first LNG cargo. That ship left our facility this past Monday and we expect another cargo to arrive in the next several days. The commissioning is now underway and we expect the project to begin commercial operations and start receiving revenue later this month. This is the first LNG receipt terminal in the West Coast of North America, an accomplishment that we are all extremely proud of.", "In Louisiana our Cameron receipt facility is now 80% complete. This project remains on track to be completed by the end of the year. As Mark mentioned earlier, Merrill Lynch terminated their capacity agreement for Cameron.", "As you'll remember from our Analyst Conference, we have invested about $2 billion in this LNG business. And just based on our current contracts and the forward curve for natural gas, we will receive an 8% to 9% un-levered return from our LNG portfolio, and we have significant additional upside based on our ability to contract the remaining supply.", "Now let's move to slide 13. There has been a lot of recent progress on the Rockies Express Pipeline project. In January we began service on the Rockies Express West portion of the pipeline that runs from Colorado to Kansas. Approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of gas is now flowing. Service on the entire 700 mile western portion of the pipeline should begin later this month. As per Rockies Express East we received the final environmental impact study from the FERC last month. We expect to receive final approval to construct later this quarter and begin construction early this summer. We are still targeting a yearend in service date but that's dependent on the timing of FERC approval.", "Please go to slide 14. In summary, here are a couple of key highlights. We had a strong first quarter led by contributions from our California Utilities and our Pipelines & Storage business. We remain focused on the completion of our major construction projects and regulatory proceedings. And finally I'd say, it's been a busy start to this year. We have gotten a lot accomplished, we are focused on execution and we look forward to providing you additional updates on our progress as we go through the year.", "And with that I am going to open up the call and take any questions that you may have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to John Kiani with Deutsche Bank.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Can we assume that... at least at this point, you are not going to build Tatostin [ph] and PJM since FERC did not pass the CONE [Cost of New Entry] increase?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's safe to say from our perspective that the economics that currently exist don't warrant us making an entry at this point-in-time.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks Don. And then another question I have is, is there anything that you all can do or you plan to do to extract value from the land that you own at Port Arthur?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have mentioned, I think, for the last year or so that we are exploring, putting in a marine cargo terminal. That region around Port Arthur is doing a lot of expansion in terms of the refinery growth. And we happen to be situated on the waterway with a lot of land that's in excess of our needs for an L&G terminal that could be utilized for a marine oil terminal. We have an open season some months ago, it was very positive, we're in the process right now of evaluating those responses, and should we get enough firm commitments to launch that project, we will.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Can you provide or have you provided any type of estimate for what type of capital investment that would entail?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The size of terminal that we're looking at, the capital cost could be between $350 million and $500 million depending on how much we build up.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "And that's obviously incremental to the current capital spending program and growth guidance you've provided recently at your Analyst Meeting?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "May ask Mark to make sure that wasn't included in the forecast.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in our capital we had some discretionary sort of capital that we hadn't committed to specific projects, so it is kind of included in there.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Got you, in the discretionary?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "John Kiani - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. Nice quarter by the way. One of the facts that you guys keep your conference calls very short. Couple of questions, first of all there has been some chatter about RBS maybe being a little bit behind the curve in meeting its obligations with the joint venture because of its troubles, are you seeing anything like that at all?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolute not Lasan. This joint venture got launched and never missed a beat. As you know the management is all in place. And we and RBS are moving forward as though that there has been no change to the business.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Excellent. Kind of a strategic question. Sempra has done a phenomenal job of taking some of these distant dreams of accomplishing some unregulated businesses and actually coming fruition and realizing the grand plan, so to speak. I hate to duce [ph] you, Don, but what's next on regulated side. Also the very obvious and new to impair [ph], are you thinking of something more draconian and dramatic, dramatic that we haven't thought about?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think there is any surprises, Lasan. We have signaled that in many different forums that we're all about organic growth, and that we have a lot of organic growth opportunities. And so I think the area that we continue to be focused is natural gas infrastructure, which we think the country is going to need a lot more of, especially with this whole debate on global warming and constraints on emissions. And beyond that we are actively ramping up our renewables business, and over time you will see us become a bigger player in the renewable space.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "And again thoughts on going overseas for liquefaction. I know you've talked about kind of maybe potentially looking at that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have... we mainly have been looking at it in the past from the standpoint of having the marketing capability coming out of new terminals. If we found a location in the world where it made sense for us to invest in upstream liquefaction, after giving our proper consideration, we'd look at it.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "What are the criterias you'd be looking at?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "What country it's in, what advantage that gas supply would have based on its location, who our partners would be... the typical stuff.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Would that involve an intermediation of the joint venture with RBS, and then maybe taking some capacity on Cameron?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think, one of things that we expect to have happened is because RBS is so spread around the world in terms of number of projects they finance that we would expect to have more opportunity to make investments upstream.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, Mark, not to put a damp on you or anything, but we were kind of expecting $9 million expense for the delay in bringing... I think it was Cameron online a little bit, we thought that was going to be the first quarter of this year, is that not the case?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am actually not sure what you are referring to, $9 million delay payment.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yeah, charge or something like that.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't know. I mean Cameron is right on target and there is no, there is nothing, there is no penalties or anything facing us with respect to that.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. I'll take it offline with, Jeff, just in case. What was the background on this write-down with the mining company?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We'll have Mark Snell take that.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The mining company was, it was the company called Black Diamond, it was a coal mine. And we had... they had hedged some of their forward production, we were one of the parties that they had hedged it with. With the rapid increase in coal prices they became exposed to us. We called for adequate assurance on margin, they couldn't meet the margin call, we closed about, and that was the end of it.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I see. Just one last question, what can we expect in terms of kind of ongoing contribution from the joint venture to Sempra's earnings going forward, now that you've kind of closed the deal and moving forward?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, just as happy... we anticipate that we gave a range of $2.50 to $3.50 for this year and we anticipate meeting... being in that range.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "And no change given the current gas price forecast and coal price forecast and the metal prices going nuts all over the world, all prices along with it.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We are not changing our estimates at this time.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Wow. Okay. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Lasan.", "Operator", "We will go next to Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia", "Couple of quick one. Just off of that last issue with this write-off in commodities. Given the situation in the credit markets, do you expect to see a little bit more in terms of credit issues and perhaps a little bit elevated level of write-offs relative to the past or are you comfortable with your exposure.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me have Mark Snell take this.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sam, we historically, credit reserves and credit write-offs have been a very, very insignificant part of our business. And even in this... that's premise on the fact that we have a fairly aggressive credit department, especially in trading. And we margin quite aggressively. And we really don't let these things try to get out too far ahead of us.", "When you have rapid changes in commodity prices it can cause counterparties to be greater exposed than they had anticipated. And so it can cause some liquidity problems. And that's what causes us to close it out. Now this... we may very well not lose as much money as we've written off on this. I mean we have good claims and the mine is producing and they are going to... hopefully they'll pay us off. But we just... we move quickly on these things and we move aggressively, and that's why we've had very little problems and we don't anticipate anything out of the ordinary going forward.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia", "Okay. Don, you hinted at possibly doing more in the future in the renewable space, can you give us any kind of a hint as to what area of that very broad theme you might be looking at?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Sam, what I would say is... as you are aware, in the West, almost all of the utilities have some fairly aggressive renewable portfolio goals. And we have been staking out some positions with land and with land options, so we can expand on the footprint we already have in Mexico with Lagu da Moreca [ph] and also around some of our existing generation sites.", "So I think you could look forward as the prices support our entry, seeing as to some wind and some different types of sore.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia", "Okay. We'll keep an eye on that. Thanks a lot.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Mark Segal with Canaccord Adams.", "Mark Segal - Canaccord Adams", "Hi, yes, hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions regarding your AMI deployment. Have you made a final selection regarding all the related vendors for that project ahead of the Q1 '09 expected rollout?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, let me have Debbie Reed respond to that.", "Mark Segal - Canaccord Adams", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Good morning, Mark. We are in the process of negotiating our final arrangements and we are not going to be announcing a vendor until we negotiated a contract and that will probably be towards the end of May.", "Mark Segal - Canaccord Adams", "Okay, and then is there any further regulatory approval or permitting that needs to take place for that?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Well, let's put it into two pieces. For the San Diego Gas & Electric side we've received full regulatory approval for $572 million, $500 million of which is capital. And we don't need any further approval to deploy. On the Southern California Gas Company side, we are looking at deploying the AMI technology on the gas meters for the SoCalGas customers, and we would be making a filing for that later this year with the hopes of getting approval in 2009.", "Mark Segal - Canaccord Adams", "Okay, and lastly, with regards to your plans for SoCalGas. Will that deployment leverage existing infrastructure in place with SoCalEdison?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "That will be one alternative that would be look at, we'll also look at standalone and do a comparison so that we will look at. If we do it on a standalone basis, we would deploy it throughout all of the meters and it would be about $1 billion investment. And we think that that would probably be a good long-term solution for our customers is to have all customers on the same platform. But we will look at the cost if we were to do it on the Edison overlap which would be about $600 million for deployment there. And look at the comparison between the two, and that's why we're taking sometime now to do request for proposals and gather that information before we make our regulatory filing.", "Mark Segal - Canaccord Adams", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys congrats on a good quarter.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Two, three questions one on we're still in the process in California where the CPUC and the CAL, ISO [ph] and CEC and all the interveners are debating what the capacity market structure might look like. Can you talk about your view and how in-city versus system resources might be treated in whatever gets designed?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me ask Debbie, if she has a point of view from the person that will be taking this capacity?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Good morning, Michael. We are working actively to get a capacity market established in California. We think that that is the best solution for our customers. And the way that we would envision the capacity market working is that there would be a number of nodes and we would bid our capacity that we have and we own into the market at cost and then buy that back. So, I am not sure if I understand specifically your question about in-city resources versus... it would be a market for the whole state and then there would be regionalized nodes that would have different pricing at those nodes.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I guess the question is would all assets be treated equally, meaning new versus old, because of... as I understand how the capacity market works right now, local system resources get treated... local resources get treated differently pricing wise than system resources. And also in the capacity market debate there has been some discussion about treating new versus old assets differently from a pricing perspective?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "That's right. That is something that the CPUC is looking at as part of the transition and that really has to do a lot with our ability right now to go out for a request for proposal for resources and ensure that there is incremental capacity being added. It's less about... being ahead of the pricing when you have a whole market structure put in place. But the CPUC is looking at that and determining how that is going to be handled on the long-term. I think that the way that we would envision it is that all resources would be treated equal when you have enough resources, but that we would be able to go out for proposals to get added resources when we needed to have added resources when we needed to have added resources to meet the resource adequacy requirement.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And Don or Mark, kind of taking it up a step and thinking about your non-regulated generation, you've actually seeing some pretty different prices for asset transactions recently. Just curious, kind of, how you think about at what stage you are a seller?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We look at it... and we look at it all the time. We have a contract that runs through 2011, and it's obvious that prices are moving up which is a recognition that this region needs more capacity. So I think we always, if you are talking about from the standpoint of our assets, something we would sell, is... was that's your question?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah. Your gas generation plant?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think the way we look at it is... when this contract... before this contract expires we are going to take a look at what people are willing to contract for the output of those plants. We know what those plants transact for in the open market, and so from our standpoint if we can't get what they are worth. And I think one of the things we would consider is should we sell the plants.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So you'll likely wait until the contract actually expires before going to that process?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've started doing some feelers now. We are taking some smaller amount of capacity and going out and seeing what the market is willing to pay. And it looks like that we are getting about... in terms of the offers we received so far for energy, that we're getting about 80% to 85% of the cost of the new bill. So that's probably about where we think we should be. Neal had a comment here.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "We'll just make one other comment... we've looked at this a lot of times, and it's pretty difficult to make the sales of these kinds of assets. It depends a lot when you look at the tax leakage associated with the sale. And when you also look at new build cost, I think you would come to the conclusion that these assets are going to be very valuable assets going forward.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Understood.", "Operator", "We will go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good afternoon.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "With regards to the Costa Azul revenues coming on stream next month. Is that for both the Shell and the Tangu [ph] revenues or is it just one of the other.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's just the Shell contract the Tangu [ph] delivery starts a little over a year from now.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Got you. And on the California Phase II cost-to-capital proceeding. I believe ALJ [Administrative Law Judge] issued some recommendation. Is there anything that we should read from those recommendations that would change your ROE assumptions or capital ratios for the utilities?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll let Debbie get into this, but it's a recommendation that we are pretty satisfied with.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Basically the cost of capital recommendation that came out in the proposed decision is almost identical to what San Diego Gas & Electric has been operating with under the last several years. So we were quite pleased with a proposed decision.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay with regards to the smart metering rollout for SDG&E. In your pilot programs can you discuss a little bit what, can you discuss a little bit about what you saw in some of those program in terms or per capita consumption and declines or increases or... did the program work, I think that's why this has all being ruled out.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Go ahead, Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes, Faisel. I can talk about the pilots that were done on a statewide basis. We are going to be rolling out our own pilot of the first meter deployment at SDG&E of a large group of meters, 5,000 meters, in about a month. But we did some statewide work early on where we tried different, different... with the meters and different technologies being used to give price signal to the customers including colored orbs and things like that, to let them know when there were extreme peak days.", "What we found is that the reduction in demand was 12% to 15% during some of those pilots. And what we also found is that the combination of the metering and then something in the home that gives the customer more information, really help to sustain that type of demand reduction, absent that there was erosion over time. So what we are really looking at is how do we combine our energy efficiency and demand response programs with the smart meter to do that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. Do you have any estimates in terms of what that might shave off, some of your peak demand numbers in SDG&E.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Well in our Ks my recollection is there was around 200 megawatts of demand reduction after full deployment that we were looking at in our system coming from the smart meters.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. And on the smart metering for the gas customers, any estimate in terms of what that would cost?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah, if we did full deployment across our customers, we would be looking at about $1 billion. And these are very rough numbers, I would say, as we haven't gone out and gotten any specific proposals. We are using, kind of, the SDG&E data and extrapolating that for SoCalGas.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, do you guys have the same sort of program that PG&E has for reducing customer usage with regards to their gas utility customers also, the 10/20 plan?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "I'm not familiar with that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Where customers basically are incentivised to reduce their consumption and they get a rebate along those lines, you guys don't have a similar program?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "That's... I think you said on the gas side, that's on the electric side.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah, and we've have that historically. We have a lot of summer programs that provide peak demand reduction where we incent customers to cycle air conditioning, where we incent commercial and industrial customers to offload during peak. And well there is a whole variety of programs we have in that regard.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And one last question on the Sunrise transmission line. Is there any change from your previous comments on the timing of when a decision is supposed to be reach, you said late this year, but is that changed at all?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Faisel, no. In fact the hearings, we think the hearings are going to be over today or early next week. And that the ALJ has indicated that it appears that he will be able to maintain the schedule at least that's what he's telling us which would get us a final EIR, EIS in June, a proposed decision sometime in July, and then a final decision, hopefully, by the end of the year.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Paul Fremont with Jefferies.", "Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.", "Alright, two quick questions. One as the... as California moves to a multi-year cost of capital proceeding, is there something in the process that makes the establishment for all three companies of the cost of capital parameters more standardized or do you still expect it to be still very individual for each company?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll let Debbie take a shot at this, but my sense is the Commission will have the flexibility to custom tailor this for issues that each utility may have.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah, I would just add that the mechanism that's been adopted now would be the same mechanism for each company, but it would trigger off of our authorized ROEs that we received last year. There are provisions though in this too... if there are extreme type of blowouts or modest changes in interest rates or whatever that each utility can go in and on in independent basis make an individual filing to address those issues.", "Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.", "No, on a longer term basis than your [ph], you would not expect sort of the differences that currently exists to potentially narrow in terms of... because there seems to be a fairly good spread between ROEs and his bag [ph]", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah, we would be able to back end [ph] in 2011 to have any new ROEs authorized effective in 2011. But that we would use this mechanism between now and 2011.", "Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.", "And then my other question... I guess this is a trading question other entities have sort of been hurt or were caught in being long heat rate. How was it that your operation would be able to avoid that and do you believe that the situation that occurred in the first quarter with respect to heat rate was more of an anomaly?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Are you speaking to the heat rate change that took place in PJM?", "Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.", "Yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I guess, first of all we didn't have a dog in that fight, so... but we are watching it from a far to see if there is any learnings from it. I don't think that I know enough that I could give you any intelligence as to what we think is happening there, except that there was just a short drop in the average market heat rate over a very short period of time.", "Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go to Asher Khan with Sac Capital.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "Good afternoon. I was trying to wonder is there is some way you could give us an idea that if the settlement had been around what the higher earnings could have been from the utility business in the first quarter?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Debbie, do you want to address this.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes. Asher, what I would say is that the ranges that we gave you at the Analyst Meeting in March that were $4.85 to $5.35. We would hold to those for the year, that reflects the adoption of the settlement. And that we would feel that the ranges that we gave you are right on track.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "But you can't tell you how much incremental the first quarter could have been and what you have been accruing?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Well, we haven't... the way that we book for the first quarter is based upon the 2007 revenue requirement. We have even seen a propose decision yet to say that the settlements is been adopted, although we would anticipate that. And so I hope you understand that until we get that we're just really focused on our annual results. We do watch it closely and we are very confident with those annual ranges that we gave you.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "Okay and second, I just want to go back to the Chile and Peru assets. You said you were looking them. Could you tell me what the status is in terms of them, whether it's going to stay on part of the Sempra family or it's still a review that is going on?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, longer term we've said that we're going to exit South America, and that is the plan. These are not strategic assets. The assets in Chile and Peru are very good earning assets though and so as we look at... at the appropriate time to exit, we want to make sure that we get value for those assets and we've got something else to invest that money, and it will give us some equivalent returns.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "So, you haven't reached that point yet Don, is that correct?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct, we have not.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "If I can finish off, Mark how much and I know you're going to replace this with something else down the road. But how much in the 2012 earnings would you say the Merrill Lynch contract contributed?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well it was very little, in fact, and if you recall from our... I don't know if you were at our Analyst Conference or not. But at the Analyst Conference I gave a something that's a breakdown of all of our earnings and showed that only, roughly 12% of our 2012 earnings were attributable to kind of, it's not just spot cargos, Tatostin [ph] Sunrise all of the things that are not 100% definite that we are going to do... that could happen. All of those things combined only contributed 10%, 12% of our total earnings.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "Okay, so this is a small portion of that, is that correct to look at out of that 100%.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's a very small portion.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I want to come back to it to the comments I that gave at the beginning of this call. We are building, we have build these assets for the long-term 30 years or more. And one of things that we did upfront is we make sure in our contracting that we have the ability to get a return of and a return on that investments. And that's why there is $2 billion of LNG investment that we have is going to generate just with the contracts that we have in place about an 8% to 9% un-leveraged return. And so, that gives us a very good position now to watch what's happening in the market and decide at what price and when we will release additional capacity to the market.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "Okay, and if I can end up sorry the remaining $0.5 billion of buyback, when could we expect the decision whether it could be a buyback or reinvestment is that something for January next year when you report.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well right now we've committed to do $1.5 billion to $2 billion and... we are still on track to do that, we'll wrap-up with $1 billion we'll close out this year in the fourth quarter and then we'll launch into the next $500 million and whether we go beyond $500 million or not we haven't decided yet.", "Asher Khan - Sac Capital", "Thank you very much, Mark.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Good afternoon guys can you here me?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Paul go ahead.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I apologize if you have already gone over this. The Kentucky power plant and with new CONE and heat rate situation at PJM, any the additional thoughts on that?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well, yeah I did answer that's earlier and that is that new the CONE was published and they --the process PJM in submitting their new CONE to the FERC. Didn't get approved for procedural reasons, we have decided not to enter the market based upon capacity prices. Now that does not mean that we are... that we are not out shopping with utilities for a contract. But currently the economics in that region don't support us going forward with the new build, without a contract or a hire CONE.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay now you saw Exelon recent announcement and you have seen other companies in terms of what they are willing to do. Any thoughts on those submarkets or just in general and when you look at that heat rate decline in PJM. What do you guys make of that, I mean from your trading perspective in general just. What do you think is fundamentally driving that and just any other favor we have on that?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well as I said, we look at it with interest not because we have a position there. But just because we are trying to figure out what is taken place in that marketplace. I think we have points of views. We were sitting around this morning before the call talking about that. I don't think we have consensus among our management as to what is talking place there.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Really, okay. That would be interesting to find out more of that or may be we won't go over right now. But then I'm sorry about this... the currency impact for the quarter. What was that?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Currency impact.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Yeah.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "This is Joe Householder, there is... it was exchange rates in South America. Those currencies are pushing against the dollar, improved earnings in South American business,", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "How much was that again?", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "That was about $4 million.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Thanks a lot guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Now we'll go to a follow-up from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, Debby last we chatted... we had talked about potentially securing new gas sources for SoCal and any kind of progress on whether you might have a strategic alliance with one of the existing pre-proposed pipes or may be from a foreign source?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "No nothing to report on that regard Lasan. We're continuing to look at... at that as some of our interstate capacity is expiring but nothing to report on that.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay that's fine. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, my follow was already asked and answered. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "We'll go to Mike Patchen with Deutsche Asset Management.", "Michael Patchen - Deutsche Asset Management", "Alright, thanks, could you tell us what would be the triggers to buy the remaining share buyback after the $1 billion you have planning to buy $2 billion?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, go ahead.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, I've talked about this earlier, but again we've committed to $1.5 billion to $2 billion program. We will do $1.5 billion, so after the billion dollars is closed out in the fourth quarter, we'll launch into the next $500 million and that will probably would be in the first quarter of next year or may come a little sooner and then beyond that, beyond the $1.5 billion the decision whether to go from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, we will make it at that time.", "Michael Patchen - Deutsche Asset Management", "Okay. And this 11% earnings growth you mentioned earlier. Is that coming of the '07 base?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Of the '08 base.", "Michael Patchen - Deutsche Asset Management", "Okay. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "And at this time we have no other questions. I would like to turn the call back to Don Felsinger for any additional or closing comments.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks again for joining us for our first quarter 2008 earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, you know how to get a hold of Jeff, Glen or Scott. You guys all have a great weekend.", "Operator", "And again it does conclude today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Martin. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Martin - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good afternoon, I'm Jeff Martin. We know how busy everyone is with earnings season, so we appreciate the fact you've taken the fact to join us today.", "This afternoon we will be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2008 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, President and CEO of Sempra Utilities and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You will note that slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

It's important also to note that all of the earnings per share amount in our presentation today are shown on a diluted basis.", "And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Don, who'll begin with slide 3.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, good morning. Thanks Jeff, and thanks to each of you for joining us.", "Here is a format for today's call. First, Mark Snell and I will start with the financial results. And I will update you on the status of our key business activities. And then, as we usually do, we will close with any questions that you may have.", "Now to the financial results; earlier this morning, we reported second quarter net income of $244 million or $0.98 per share compared with second quarter 2007 net income or $277 million or $1.05 per share. We are pleased with our performance for the first half of 2008 with strong results from our California utilities and a great start for our new joint venture, RBS Sempra Commodities. Based on the strength of our first half performance combined with an improved outlook for the reminder of the year, we are increasing our guidance to a new range of $3.80 to $4 per share, a $0.15 increase over our previous guidance.", "Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, who will take you through the business unit results beginning with slide 4.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Don.", "Well, Sempra Utilities second quarter 2008 net income increased 11% to $117 million from a $105 million in the year ago period. San Diego Gas & Electric net income for the second quarter improved to $61 million compared with $51 million in the year ago-quarter, primarily due to the performance incentives recognized during the quarter and the impact of a lower effective tax rate.", "At Southern California Gas, second quarter 2008 net income was $56 million, up from $54 million in the second quarter of 2007. For the first six months of 2008, Sempra Utilities net was $248 million, up from $222 million in 2007. It's important to note that earnings from our utilities for the first six months of 2008 do not include any revenue increase from the rate case decision we received last week. As a result of the revenue increase now being retroactive to January 1st of this year, earnings for this first six months of 2008 would have been approximately $42 million higher. That increase will be recognized into the third quarter.", "Now let's go to slide 5. Sempra commodities reported second quarter net income of $130 million in 2008 compared with $155 million in the prior year's quarter. This is the first reporting period under our new joint venture with RBS and reflects our reduced ownership in the business. All prior periods represents Sempra's ownership at the 100% level.", "Second quarter 2008 net income included $93 million in equity earnings from the joint venture and a $67 million gain on the transaction with RBS, offset by $30 million in charges primarily related to litigation and tax issues. The excellent results from the joint venture in the quarter were driven primarily by the strong contributions we had from our natural gas and power segment.", "Now let's move to slide 6. What I'd like to do here is to go into a little more detail on the earnings allocation from our new joint venture. The JV had an extremely strong quarter with $646 million of margin on a mark-to-market basis. After operating expenses, the JV had $334 million in pre-tax distributable income or about $220 million on the standalone after-tax basis, well above the year-ago quarter.", "Now let's review how the partnership income is distributed. First, Sempra gets the 15% return on its $1.6 billion of invested capital, which for the quarter equaled $60 million. After RBS received its return on capital, then Sempra gets 70% of the next $500 million in annual earnings, which for the quarter was $87 million. Finally, Sempra gets 30% of all remaining earnings or in this case $18 million for the quarter.", "For the total distributable earnings to Sempra for the quarter were $165 million. After adjusting the U.S. GAAP and for the impact of U.S.... for the impact of taxes, Sempra share of the joint venture equity earnings was $93 million. One quick note: overtime, we expect the U.S. GAAP adjustments to eventually go away as we completely transition of moving certain contract that are held at the joint level over to RBS.", "Please move now to slide 7. Second quarter net income for our generation business was $23 million compared with $10 million in the same quarter in 2007. The improvement in the second quarter of 2008 was due primarily to $17 million in increased earnings from plant operations due to scheduled maintenance and associated downtime that impacted the operations in 2007.", "Now, please move to slide 8. In the second quarter 2008, Sempra pipeline and storage reported net income of $24 million, a 41% increase over the $17 million reported in 2007. The Rockies Express West Pipeline, which went into full service in May, contributed $7 million of earnings in the quarter. Also for the first six months of 2008, net income increased to $50 million, up from $33 million for the same period of 2007. The improvement was primarily due to $12 million of earnings from Rockies Express.", "Please turn slide 9. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results and I'll highlight a few points starting with our LNG business. Sempra LNG recorded a net loss of $28 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with a net loss $13 million in the prior period. The higher losses were primarily due to higher income tax expense related to Mexican taxes on the appreciation of the peso with respect to the U.S. denominated debt. And we also had higher market loss on our marketing agreement with RBS Sempra commodities.", "For the year, we expect this business unit to come in within our guidance of negative $40 million to negative $60 million. Under parent & other, we recorded a net loss of $22 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with net income of $6 million in the prior year's period primarily due to an $80 million from an interest rate swap recorded in last year's quarter.", "Please turn to slide 10. In summary, we had strong quarter. And as Don indicated, our improved confidence for the reminder of the year allows us to increase guidance to a range of $3.80 to $4 per share. Income our from California utilities increased to 11% before the benefit of our general rate case decisions. Our new commodities joint venture is off to a great start, and we believe this demonstrates potential for continued strong growth.", "In April, we began repurchasing the first $1 billion of our common stock as part of our plan $1.5 billion repurchase program. We had over 15 million shares delivered to us already, and we expect to complete the first $1 billion of the program in the fourth quarter. And finally, we've increased our quarterly dividend 13% this year from $0.31 to $0.35 per share in accordance with our targeted 35% to 40% payout ratio.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Don, who will begin with slide 11.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mark.", "Let me begin with an operational update starting with our utilities. Last week, we received a final decision on our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas. This decision together with our updated capital results in a $209 million revenue increase this year retroactive to January 1st with fixed revenue escalations in the following year averaging $95 million or over just... just over 3% year per year.", "As a result of the decision, we are not affected by changes in our customer base or productivity targets and there is no earnings sharing, both of which are important protections for shareholders and more broadly demonstrate the constructive nature of the California's regulation, particularly given the down term in the economy.", "Regarding the Sunrise Transmission project, we still expect a final decision by year-end, which would result in the line being placed into service in 2011. Last month, we also filed a request to develop a series of solar projects at SDG&E. This program would have an initial target of developing 70 to 80 megawatts of solar electricity about two-thirds of which would be utility owned with the reminder owned by third parties.", "Pending commission approval SDG&E expects to add up to an additional $250 million of rate base to develop these projects over the next five years. The first installations are targeted to be operational as early as next year. And finally, we recently began installing smart meters in SDG&E's territory and also announced Itron as our meter vendor. Full deployment will begin in 2009 with completion targeted in 2011.", "Before, I move on to our recent EnergySouth announcement, I'd like to briefly touch on what's driving the early success that we are seeing out of our commodities joint venture with RBS. As mark mentioned, the strong results we saw this quarter were driven primarily by natural gas and power. Another key development that we are seeing is increased deal flow, this coming from both new customers and of new areas of business.", "At the moment, we have a pipeline of about 50 large deals pending, many of which combined customer needs for financing with their need to hedge some form of commodity related exposure. As you'll recall, these are exactly the types of transactions we were targeting by partnering with RBS.", "Now let's move to slide 12. Last week, we announced our plans to acquire Mobile based Alabama EnergySouth for $510 million in cash. EnergySouth consist of two business lines: a growing midstream business that is in the midst of a major build up of its natural gas storage facilities that should reach 57 billion cubic of capacity when completed and an Alabaman natural gas distribution company that serves the Southwest Alabama region.", "This acquisition directly supports our broader natural gas strategy, much like our role in bringing in Rockies Gas to premium markets in the Northeast with the Rockies Express Pipeline. By expanding our Gulf Coast operation, this transaction allows us to better serve key markets in the Southeast for gas demand outpaces the national average. These two assets compliment our existing operations in the region and position us with growth in the future. This transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2009 and depending on our natural gas markets to develop will contribute up $2.30 earnings in 2012.", "Now to slide 13. This slide provides more detail of the business service comprise EnergySouth. EnergySouth midstream owns 91% of Bay Gas Storage, a facility located 40 miles north of Mobile. What we find most attractive about Bay Gas Storage is the eastern most storage facility on the Gulf Coast and we believe it's the position storage facility to directly serve the growing Florida market.", "Currently Bay Gas has more than a 11 Bcf of working storage, all of which is contracted and operational. An additional 5 Bcf is over 90% contract and is under construction with the schedule 2010 in service date. There are also plans to increase the facility's total capacity to 27 Bcf by the end of 2011.", "Their midstream business also owns 60% of Mississippi Hub gas storage. This facility has planned direct interconnections to the growing natural gas production areas in eastern Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Currently, the facilities first 6 Bcf of storage capacity is under construction and commitments are in place for 4 Bcf of this capacity. Operations are slated to commence in 2010. There are also plans to increase the total capacity to 30 Bcf by year end 2015.", "Sempra Energy share of the capital cost to build out the total storage of both Bay Gas and Mississippi Hub will be between $475 million and $525 million. You'll recall that we've talked about the growing importance of natural gas storage given the combination of high prices and continued volatility in commodity markets. That's why we think this business will compliment our existing goal portfolio.", "On the utility side, Mobile Gas serves over 90,000 customers in Southwest Alabama, a region that stands to benefit from strong economic development. Alabama has a constructive regulatory environment that authorized ROEs in the 13% range, and mechanisms in place to minimize sales and volume risks. Overall, it's an attractive regulatory environment with the risk profile some of that what we have here in California. In short, these are great businesses that will be a nice additions to the Sempra family of companies.", "Now let's move to slide 14. This slide shows EnergySouth locations in the Gulf region. In the center you'll see EnergySouth's existing business, the Mobile Gas utility, Bay Gas Storage and Mississippi Hub gas storage. You can also see that they are uniquely located to capitalize on new shale producing regions in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, as well as future LNG growth in the Gulf. Along with our current LNG pipeline and storage development in the region, we believe the EnergySouth acquisition helps lay the foundation for a highly profitable natural gas business in the gulf.", "Now let's move to slide 15. There has been a lot of progress in recent months on Rockies Express Pipeline project. In May, we began full service on the Rockies Express west portion of the pipeline that runs from Colorado to Missouri. Approximately 1.5 Bcf per day a gas is now flowing. We've also began construction of Rockies express east in July. We still target interim service by year end with completion expected in the third quarter of 2009.", "As you may have seen, total project costs for the entire pipeline are now expected to be $5.6 billion was Sempra's share of $1.4 billion. There had been a number of things that have gone well with this project, but challengeable has been around cost increases on the eastern most segment of the pipeline. These increasing cost pressures are primary due to labor escalations and changes in our preferred route.", "Even with this cost increases when Rockies Express is fully operational, we will have around $650 million of equity invested and be receiving dividends each year of about $70 million to $80 million, an attractive return on our investment. I think it also bears mentioning that today's high cost environment makes it more difficult for new pipeline projects to compete with Rockies Express.", "Early on, we were able to lock in certain costs such as steel and labor for the first half of the pipeline. That type of hedging is not available in today's cost environment. The key point is that Rockies Express or any similar pipeline couldn't be duplicated at the same price.", "Moving to LNG, at our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul terminal, we began commercial operations in May and started receiving revenue on half of the terminal. We also planned to start construction on $125 million nitrogen injection plant in the third quarter and expect completion by year end 2009. In Louisiana, our Cameron receipt terminal remains on track to be completed by the end of the year.", "Now let's move to slide 16. Let me close with a couple of summary comments. Very pleased with our strong financial results for the quarter and where we are for the first half of the year. What's important to focus on is what's driving our financial performance. First it's our California utilities; up 11% for the quarter and 12% in the first half of the year. And that excludes the impact of increased revenues from the rate cases, which will be retroactively applied to January 1.", "Secondly, it's from our pipelines and generation business. Pipelines is up over 50% in the first half with new contributions from Rockies Express and to our commodities business, producing solid growth with less risk to Sempra. On the basis of those results and our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we've raised our 2008 guidance to $3.80 to $4 per share.", "And with that, let me now open up the call and take any questions that you may have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Lasan Johong from RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. Don, the EnergySouth transaction looks very compelling, but I'm kind of wondering what you're going to do with 93,000 customers.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Of course, I mentioned, Lasan, the distribution utility came with a transaction. It's a good utility with good regulation. And for the current time, we plan to keep it.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Any opportunities to do some bolt-on type acquisitions around that small utility?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "As I mentioned that that's a growing area of the U.S. from an economic standpoint. And we look at it something that we would plan to look and make it even a better utility.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "So, you're going to operate it first, try to improve it and then maybe kind of abate [ph] to launch more potentially more acquisition.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think you should a look at everything that are doing in the Gulf is a way to enlarge out footprints. We think this is a key area for growth and for natural gas infrastructure, having storage pipelines, LNG receipt terminals and a distribution utility there give us the foundation to kind of build from.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I think that's the great idea. This is probably a question you're going to laugh at and probably say you can't answer, but I'm going to ask it anyway. What would have Sempra been able to do with the commodities business having not have the joint venture?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we'd be struggling in today's credit markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "So, you may not have gone to your $93 million?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's hard to get into hypotheticals of what we could have done or not done. We know that this is a very difficult market from a credit standpoint. Having the strength of RBS behind this transaction, looking of where commodity prices are and the positions we would have been able to hold, I think all bodes well for this. Note the fact that I mentioned, Lasan, just the deal flow that we are now getting with RBS that we didn't have access to before, makes us a really great outcome.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Understood, and I can't disagree with that. What's the progress on getting additional contacts at Cameron and ECA?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me, I will go and just start here that and I will let Neal talk about where we are contracting, but I think it comes back again to how we thought about this business. And remember we said this before that when we launched it, we launched in a way that we were able to get a return of and on our invested capital. The fact we have done that puts us in a much different position to other people that are in the space today. Because we have... there is no urgency for us to go out and do something, but we give away capacity. So, we are sitting here with full contracts at Cameron. And in total, we are getting about a 9% on lever return on that investment. We are now looking at what's happening upstream with new LNG supplies and we see them coming on stream, but let me have Neal talk about exactly what we are doing.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I don't know what else has to be commented [ph]. Just to say that we are actively talking to a lot of people in the industry about how capacities will be at the Cameron. And I think, the key point is that our fundamental view of the LNG markets really hasn't changed that much. It's absolutely true that there has been a little bit of slowdown, because these plants have taken longer to come of stream, but over the lifetime of this facilities, we think the economics are going to do as basically as we they were original.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Very nice.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the thing that we see Lasan is that gives us encouragement is that the liquefaction coming on stream that is currently either finishing up construction are going to start up testing right now is going to increase the world's LNG supply by about 50% towards the end of next year. This bodes well, because a lot of this gas will be looking for a home.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Right.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And so we believe that we have... our terminal in Cameron and we look at as location, access to pipeline, access to storage. We think it's probably one of the better terminals in that region.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I agree. One last question if I may. What's the status of progress of Rockies Express Northeast?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Remember, when we launched Rockies, it was driven by producers. Any expansion off of Rockies going into the further east is going to going to be driven by the marketplace. And we have a very cost effective pipe solution. Our competitors have a smaller pipe, and I think it's going to depend on what the market wants. If they want a bigger pipe solution, there is no doubt that we with the pipe that we have and the partner that we have can come with that solution. But we are still waiting for the market to decide what it wants.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Understood. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Goldenberg with Luminous Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Excellent results, I wanted to ask to questions; first of all, just one of the gain, a better understanding for the increase some guidance; Is it any specific unit that is performing stronger than expected or is it just overall?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well,I'm going to have... I'll have Mark Snell give you some more detail. But we sat down, Michael, a week or two ago and just kind of took a look at all of our businesses. And when we look at the fact, when we started this year, we had a lot of uncertainty. We didn't have the RBS transaction done. We didn't have our LNG terminal in operation, Rockies West wasn't flowing gas, our utilities were waiting on the outcome of the rate case. We now have got closure on almost all of those items. So when you look across the board, we see improved financial results, so we see uncertainties being eliminated and pipelines in our LNG business and our utility business and our commodities business. And it was the combination of all those things that caused us to take a look at our ongoing outlook for these businesses and increased guidance.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "If I look at March 27 presentation from this year, and you had the detailed break down of 2008 outlook. Any specific numbers you can assign that have been moved up and by how much?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Mark Snell.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Michael, I would say just generally speaking the commodity, the utilities are operating at more towards the high end of their original guidance.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Okay.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We took that into consideration. The JV is performing better than we expected early out of the box. And so we took that into consideration. And most all of our other business units are you know kind of right where we thought they would be. Actually generations is moving a little bit ahead of where we thought they would be. So, just it seems like everything was firing on all cylinders and it may tends to go ahead and make some adjustments.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "And specifically on utilities and generation, would you feel comfortable saying that the strength you are seeing in 2008 should carry over into 2009 and beyond?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, certainly in the utilities because the strength that we are seeing doesn't reflect yet the new revenues that we are going to get from the rate case. So we definitely think that, that business is going to continue on with strong performance. The generation business, some of that is a little more specific to commodity pricing and things of the particular time. But we think certainly the bulk of our income there comes from the DWR contract. And so we'll have that next year into '09 and '010.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Got you. Excellent. And just one more follow-up, specifically on the power and gas units of the trading business that have performed particularly well. I understand you are... you have your hands tied a little less to what you can say. But was it kind of directional bets, was it increased customer flow, was it long, short position? Can you provide more color as to what specifically on gas and power made you so much money this quarter?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Generallyspeaking, it's all of those and none of those. I mean we had definitely more deal flow from the bank which is what we expected. We had... because we had a rapid increase in commodity prices in the first quarter and with volatility kind of staying at historical percentage averages but those percentages translated into bigger dollars. Because of that volatility we were able to take advantage of that. And so generally speaking, we had a very good quarter.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Okay. This may be a little premature but we all know that in Q3 some of the commodities have retreated. Just wonder, would you be able to make us feel comfortable that Q3 is still kind of... nothing has happened to make you worry about Q3 or Q4?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say this, I would say that we had a really good second quarter in commodities. We did not anticipate that continuing through the end of the year, at that same pace. And so we took that as a consideration when we raised guidance.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Understandable. Excellent, thank you very much. Congratulations again.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Hi. On the commodity deals that you guys were talking about that you couldn't do last year but now you can do. Would the deals that you are now able to do, are those deals that would extend the maturity of the trade book that you guys have with RBS?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me have Mark Snell addressed that.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Faisel, some of them are longer term that, what we would have dealt with in the past. And one of the primary reasons that we liked this transaction was that the bank afforded us the liquidity to be able to enter into some longer term transactions. Most of them are probably in the neighborhood of four years and five year kind of deals because that's typically how long the banks... they're lending money to a company on let's say 5-year maturity for a bank lending operation and we're hedging against that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Got you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Neal,Mark and I attended the first Board meeting of this joint venture a couple of months ago. And I was laughing at David Messer who runs the business now, because he said that RBS had been dragging around the world on an airplane, introducing to us all their customers. And so when we talked about the fact that we've got 50 large deals in the pipeline, these are really deals that RBS is introducing Sempra Commodities too as a new arrow in their quiver they didn't have before. So they are out there making sure that their customers are aware that they now have this commodity hedging opportunity.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Got you.Okay. If I am looking at the way you get down to the equity earnings from that business, the U.S. GAAP conversion impact, the distributable income that's an IFRS basis, is that kind of similar to what you guys reported previously on kind of the real earnings?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's essentially a mark-to-market number. The IFRS number doesn't have the EITF adjustments. The bottom line is under IFRS we are allowed to mark our inventories that we use in hedging transactions. And, we are allowed to mark our pipeline of storage capacity to market. And that's really the big differences.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Got you. That makes sense. On the RECs, previously Sempra Commodities had contracted for capacity on RECs, where does that capacity sit within the firm?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It actually... it's reported the results of it we report in the commodities business.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Inthe commodities segment we've actually managed here in San Diego.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Got you. And the full economic benefit though is still split between you and RBS?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, it's not. It accrues the full economic benefit of that capacity, accrues 100% to Sempra. But we thought that because it is closest related in... its source is closest related to trading type of activity that we reported with commodities but we actually manage it here and it's not shared.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "If the differential between the Rockies and say the Ohio region is much wider than your tariff, that in theory that would be an economic benefit --", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's absolutely right.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Got you. Then on the EnergySouth deal, was that a competitive transaction or was that something you guys think that --", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That was competitive.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. And on the Sunrise transmission line, you are saying now you are looking at approval for the entire line by year end Or when is the environment approval slated to be completed by?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me ask Debra Reed just to give everybody an update and I know it's on a lot of your minds.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "The Sunrise Power Link, we are looking at approval in the fourth quarter of this year. And that it would be in service in 2011 if we received approval then. As you recall, we have had numerous hearings on this line. And we are in the process now of getting the final EIR/EIS to come out and that's supposed to be scheduled on October 13. Then the ALJ proposed decision is supposed to come out about a week later. And the first opportunity for the commission to vote is about November 21st, that's what we will be looking at.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And what's the estimate of the project cost on that line?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "Well, the estimated cost is about $1.5 billion without mitigation. And so whatever the CPC might order in mitigation may change that costs, that are estimated about $1.5 billion.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Have you guys made any preparations for major component costs in that line?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "We have had discussions with contractors, but until we get the line approved, we aren't going to be doing any hedging. So we are looking at... we did redo our estimate most recently and filed that. We filed an update but these costs are updated costs based upon those estimates.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Understood. Thanks for the time guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Faisel.", "Operator", "We'll take our net question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Good morning guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "How you doing?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good. Thanks.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I am ifI missed this but it looks like the data you used to provide on the commodities business regarding the realization of the mark-to-market and al that stuff. I can't find it, is it somewhere in the appendix or something or --", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Are you talking about tenure of the contracts?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Yes, the time that they become realize and turn into cash, it looks like this... at least I was unable to find it on this... evenly find it on the news release?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Because it's not there.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Are you guys as... now as a result of the joint venture, not going to be providing this information?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And that because I guess, RBS is the one of provider or...", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We are providing everything that RBS is providing.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. As far as the distributable cash, was it distributed to you guys or it is still at the...", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll ask Mark Snell on that.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The distributable cash represents the amount of cash that will be distributed at the end of the year. We... during the year the that we get distributions for... what our tax obligations are related to those... related to the earnings. And then at the end of the year, we distribute the rest of the cash to us.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Just back to the disclosure, will the 10-Q have this? Or is this something that you guys aren't going to be... because of the deal you're not going to provide any more?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Because this is now an equity investment we are still talking with RBS about what kind of disclosures we are going to make. This is our first attempt here to give people what we think they need to sort of model the business adequately. And so we have a fairly good breakdown of how the JV income is allocated between the partners. And we also have provided some... the information on geographic and product sales. But we aren't going to give the tenure of the book or the bars any longer.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Well I thought you guys did a great job with that. And I will miss it. I guess I understand you guys have a JV now and it's a little different.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "What we are trying to do provide the information that we think will help you guys have insight into our business and to be able to model it. We think we are giving you that information. And if we hear a lot otherwise, we will address it in the future. But, I mean, we have to be cognizant of the fact, we have a majority partner who doesn't give out that kind of detailed information even on the bank. And so we have to appreciate that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I appreciate it. Thanks guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, guys. Can you summarize the changes in your long-term capital spending plan that have occurred since your Analyst Day Meeting? Meaning the solar is the good example, obviously EnergySouth is a good example. I don't know if I'm missing anything else.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, as I look at our capital spending we gave you guidance that we're going to spend about $2.1 billion this year. And then over the remaining for years I think we are averaging about $2.3 billion or $2.4 billion a year. We are not changing that. This transaction we did for EnergySouth will in essence still avoid that we have because we are not doing Contextion [ph]. And when we look at the solar program being done by our utility, we have some other unidentified projects where we had placed all the dollars for. I think in general, we are comfortable with the numbers that we gave you several months ago. And when we take a look at the end of this year and provide guidance for next year and beyond, we will update that as we've progressed on those smartmeters of SoCalGas and any other thing that we see that it's going to come to fruition.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Michael, it's Mark Snell. Let me just make one other comment too. One thing that might be throwing your numbers off a little bit in that spending is, we redeemed $400 million of industrial development bond during that sort of auction rate note debacle that all of the companies were going through. So, we redeemed those bonds and we are reissuing some more types of bonds later on this year. So that will be kind of in and out but it may be throwing your number off because it's $400 million.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Gotit. One other question, I think little bit unrelated but thinking about it Sempra Generation opportunities for solar development. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what you think is possible in terms of megawatts over the next four or five years? And second, what types of contracts would you be seeking?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Neal, do you want to talk about this?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Sempra Generation is actively involved in developing solar projects next to their facilities in Nevada and in Arizona. They have announced that they're going to have a 10 megawatts facility online later this year in Nevada. We have acquired land and we should have the capacity ability from the land standpoint to add several hundred megawatts of solar capacity around the Nevada facility and in Arizona over time. And in terms of contracting, the intent is to fit into the various RFPs that the utilities have, all the utilities in the region have.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay but you are making this decision on the first 10 megawatts to build without having actually having a contract on the other side. Is this just kind of like a test run?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct. We just decided to build that facility and go ahead with it. We are confident that we will be able to sell the output.", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think the way to look at this is we have a technology that we are looking at that we think longer term is going to be the technology from a solar perspective that is going to be the generation of choice. We want to go ahead and get some experience on what it costs to build these. How they operate and so this $40 million, 10 megawatt announcement we have, based on how the construction goes, how they actually operate will set the stage on what we do next year and beyond in terms of looking at bidding this stuff on a larger scale into the Southwest region.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, thank you guys, congrats on the good quarter.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Samuel Brothwell with Wachovia.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi, Couple of quick ones. Just to be clear on the guidance as you updated '08 with respect to commodities. Did that include the gain on the transactional gain net of the losses?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sam, it did. Let me have Mark give some more color?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes Sam, it's Mark. It did. I would think about it this way. As our operational earnings for the quarter were kind of right at our results of the $0.98 the gain on the commodities sale was offset by some litigation reserves and taxes that we took with respect to commodities and also the Mexican tax piece that hit our pipeline business and LNG business. And those are kind of one-time unusual things. But if you take those out of it, operationally we were right at about where we were for the quarter. And given that plus the improvement at the utilities, the retroactive adjustment of the rate case and how we were performing at commodities and the other business units, we made a judgment of where we thought we would end up at the end of the year. So, that's why we increased the guidance.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Got You. I forgot my other question. I will jump back in the queue. Sorry.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Becca Followill with Tudor Pickering Holt.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Hello folks. First question on EnergySouth, the range that you have is basically breakeven on in 2009 and up $0.30 what determines that... was it return [ph] how that would play out? I know it's a time in the development of storage but, how much more just kind of what progression you guys are looking at?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Beccafor 2009 remember, we don't close this transaction until November maybe December. So, there is not a whole lot that's in here for the rest of this year. When we look at what this business will generate over time it really gets down to what the value of storage is. And we've made some assumptions that when you look at storage costs that are in the range of $0.30 to $0.40 that we think this business can generate, about on the high end, about $0.30 of net income in 2012.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "So that by 2012 how much storage would have to be developed to get to that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's building out essentially all the storage we have that is identified. I don't know if it's in your chart or not.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "It's got 27Bs by 2011 for Bay Gas, but Mississippi Hub is upto 30 by 2015, so how much of the Mississippi Hub would be developed?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Ofthe 57 we are acquiring about 40 of it, or about 40 Bcf of new storage in operation in 2012.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "And what determines whether or not you develop a just demand?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean it's like everything else we do. We will lay out a plan for that area, we will go out and talk to customers. And if we can enough contracts signed up for the right price to launch we will, and so this would be no different. We are seeing very strong interest right now. As you notice that we already have about 20Bs contracted. So we are seeing strong interest in the marketplace to develop more. We will actually get contracts in place for the majority of that before we launch the next increment.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Great, thank you. And then on the commodities business, you said that you have 50 large deals pending, from your reference, what was this like a year ago at this time? How many large deals did you have pending and --?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The types of deals that we are talking about here are really deals where RBS is providing financing, and the customer is looking for some way to hedge the output of that... the solar that's being financed, we really weren't doing any of these deals.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay. So all this is incremental. And then for going forward you guys have three months under your belt with the JV. What you guys have seen so far in July... it's tremendous performance for just three months under a JV. Are you seeing continued momentum going into July and August?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "One month or three months don't make a business. Markets are fairly volatile. And we do have confidence looking through the rest of this year that, to give us enough comfort to make a change to our guidance that coupled with other businesses, I just wouldn't forecast what we plan to see in terms of what the commodity markets will give us.", "Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Becca.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Asher Khan [ph] with SAC Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon, congrats. I had a question on the rate case, if you can. You mentioned on the slide that $42 million earnings benefit related to the first half of 2008. Can we multiply that number by two and say the benefit for the year would be 84?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Could but you would be wrong.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Could you tell us what's happening in the second half?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Asher, let me have Debbie just kind of walk you through how to think about that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And Debbie, if you could also, because now it's a final decision, could you hope you can elaborate what the rate case means additional earnings for the next three years also based on the decision?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "Well, Asher, let me try to address your first question which was the 42. The 42 reflects the adjustment for the first half of the year. We will have additional revenues of $209 million split between the two utilities. But of course, we do have additional costs, and we have been operating under our 2007 authorized margin is what we were recording for the first half of the year.", "That we would... we have looked, as Mark has said, at what we would expect for the remainder of the year. We had a very strong first half and we do believe that we would be at the high end of our range, as a result of the rate case decision and how we are managing the business. We don't forecast now for the next two to three years. We will be... when we do the analyst meeting next year we will be revising all of our forecasts at that time.", "Unidentified Analyst", "You would have some sense, I guess, to additional earnings the next one, two, three years under the rate case. So you are saying the utility... you will go through the process of revision by spring of next year, though the numbers are going to be higher. Is that a fair conclusion?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "Yes. We have laid out... we laid out for you our plan in the analyst meeting and showed that plan reflected the settlement in the rate case and what we would anticipate that. That we will look at that again as we do every year and make any revisions that are necessary but that plan as we showed you back in the spring reflected the settlement in our rate case.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Asher.", "Operator", "We have a follow up question from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Don, it strikes me as being self evident that the best use of your new storage assets from EnergySouth will come through the Sempra Commodities business. But since that is now a majority owned by somebody else, how do you structure the integration and the benefits from the two coming together?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, obviously Sempra Commodities... Sempra-RBS Commodities will have access to the storage like any other third party would. And the --", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Do youcharge the JV a fixed fee for utilizing the space like you and any other third party --", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Remember we have partners in these projects. So we can't do anything that is favorable to our own affiliate.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay I understand that. Don, it seems to me also that given the current credit situation that having done a lot of transactions in the private equity for generation that there might be some potentially opportunistic acquisition scenarios developing, would that be a fair statement?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a standard answer. I always give you Lasan that we are always looking at opportunities where we think we can either do something at attractive price or will bring some strategic value to something that we look at buying or building.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "But has the environment changed to favor with that kind of analysis?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say so. I mean we've... you look at there are fewer people in the marketplace today, there are fewer people they can do deals and so being financially strong as we are I think that if we saw deal that we wanted to do that I'd have more confidence we can get it done.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And lastly, conservation; are you seeing any evidence of that in your utilities?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Debbie would address that.", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "And actually on the electric side, we are continuing to see peak low growth of about 1.5% to 2% per year and sales growth of about 1.5% through year on an 12 months running average. So, we are not seeing much in that regard at all.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "What about the gas side, the gas and electric?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Financial Officer for Sempra Energy Utilities", "On theSoCalGas side, we are seeing about 0.8% growth and customers about 45,000 meters, and our consumption is level there, and it's pretty level there for several years.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Interesting, thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Lasan.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Annie Tsao with AllianceBernstein.", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "Good afternoon. Just wondering in terms in your commodity sector, power and gas, can you give a little bit of color in this quarter? Do you see the liquidity come down because of the financial player being pulled down, because we heard from a lot of other sources?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Your question is, was there less liquidity in the market, because there is fewer players in gas and power sector?", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "Yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't believe we have seen that. Mark, do you have any?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I think... generally speaking through the second quarter, I think the amount of liquidity and activity was pretty good. We had a fairly rapidly rising commodity market, and I think there was... again, we tend to deal more in physical and the physical side of the business, and that hasn't been affected as much by some of the financial players dropping out. But how that continues on, we will wait and see.", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "And on the share repurchase program, should we assume this about $200 million left for the rest of the year?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "How many millions left?", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "About $200 million.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I don't...", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "Is it from your $1 billion to $1 billion?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "What we did? We did an accelerated share repurchase program as you remember, and we committed to buy $1 billion dollars worth of stock back this year. We have been delivered about 15 million shares so far. That was early on and now we are just... they're wrapping that program up. And it will wrap up in the fourth quarter. We will bring in a $1 billion worth this year.", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "Okay. And lastly does this Sempra Utility, you have about $4 million benefit from the San Diego Gas & Electric from lower tax rate? What kind of tax rate we should assume going forward?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Joe Householder, would you take that?", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "Sure. Going forward for the year for SDG&E, the tax rate for 2008 about 36%.", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "Okay, all right. Last... I do have one more question. CapEx; do you have any changes since the last time?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think I said that earlier; if you missed it, that we expect of CapEx to kind of be what we have forecasted for the year.", "Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Just curious, the Supreme Court came back on the western contracts issue, and looks like the remanded some issues back to the FERC and upto Mobile-Sierra, is there is sort of impact to you guys over the next 6 to 12 months in terms of...", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Faisel,I don't. We actually thought that decision was right in line with what we thought that the Supreme Court would do. It's been remanded back to the FERC and it's going to take its time work through that process, but don't expect any change this year.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Worms with BMO Capital.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. Can you just go over for me what the tax change was at the utility company in the quarter?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Michael, you are fading out. Could you...", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Sorry, can you hear me for now?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Just wondering what the lower tax rate was at the utility company what drilled that and what drilled the tax rate be going forward to rest of the year.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "What drilled the lower tax rate at the utility?", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Joe Householder, again.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "Hi, what was really driving it in the quarter is we have additional software expense, which flows right through to the rates. We get immediately deducted in that actually flows rate through the rate in the rate making.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So we will... it will just continue throughout rest of the year?", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "Yes, that's the projection for the year, and it's actually driving effective rate down for the year it's blended in.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So, the 36% is for the entire year.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay,fair enough. And then on the at the commodities level, can you just go over that second bullet on slide 5, the $67 million gain? What was driving that or what drove that? And then what was offset was on the litigation impact matters?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'vegrabbed the slide here, so slide five commodities?", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Yes.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Mark Snell.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Maybe there is some surprise, because we have basically signaled that we sold the business or half of the business to RBS at book. And so maybe the fact that we are having a gain surprises some people. But I think generally speaking we did sell it at book and for the most part since we mark-to-market all of the assets on a daily basis or most of the assets, you would expect there to be fairly little gain. But there were some assets that under U.S. GAAP we couldn't mark-to-market and the purchase agreement allowed us to mark those assets to market, especially under IFRS. That was primarily transportation, inventories, and storage that we owned. And so we did mark that to market and we were able to realize the benefit for that.", "Now the full benefit, the full gain on those types of things we only recognized half of it, because we continued to own half of the business. So that we didn't really recognize the full gain on that, but we recognized half of it. And then there was some other items too that things like they are building in some other assets that we mark-to-market. So, that was really the differences. It didn't amount to that much, but it was significant.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the litigation and tax matters, what was that?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, litigation was just additional reserve that we took on litigation that we indemnified identified our RBS for and those related to things around the California energy crisis that involved trading. We had some reserves on the books already. And we just pumped those up as part of the close. And then the other things were the tax matters was... it was a UK expense, we lost the case in the UK equivalent of the tax course, and so we made an accrual for that.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "And one final question, thank you. The U.S. GAAP conversion impact, you said, will go away over time. Can you kind of quantify time?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We are hoping that by the end of this year we'll have no weighted all of the significant agreements over to the bank. And it's a little complex, but let me just take a stab at simplifying it. As we move all of these contracts to the bank, the bank will pay us the fee for managing exactly equal to the IFRS or the international accounting standards profit on those contracts and that will eliminate the GAAP adjustments.", "Michael Worms - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Elvira Scotto with Banc of America Securities.", "Elvira Scotto - Banc of America Securities", "Just one quick follow up on the Rockies Express; just on the cost side. The $5.6 billion the total costs; is that... you think that's a good number now or is there still potential for that to move higher? Is there anything kind of outstanding and how should we think about that?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The project team, led by Kinder, went through this about a month or a month and a half ago, revised all the numbers up. There is always the uncertainty. We had quite a few conditions from the FERC that we are going to meet. And as we look at those environmental conditions and the routing decisions, there is always the chance that the cost could change. But we think the $5.6 billion with what we know today is a good number.", "Elvira Scotto - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. Everything else I had has been answered. Thank you.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Manuel Garcia with Banc of America Securities. Yes, we'll go back to Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Yes, I'm sorry. You had mentioned some charges in the LNG segment that appeared close to the formation of the JV. What... can you elaborate on that how we should think about it?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sam,I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you very well; you have faded out. Could you just... if you're little closer to the phone and speak.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "I'm sorry; you mentioned some charges in the LNG segment that seem to crop up post formation of the commodities JV. Could you elaborate on that and how we should think about it?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I'm not sure exact... maybe there is a little bit of misunderstanding. We had some charges on the LNG segment related to the Mexican taxes and what those are we have U.S. dollar denominated that in Mexico. And under the Mexican tax law, if the Peso appreciates, the amount of Pesos required to pay down that debt is reduced, and therefore we have a gain and we pay tax on gain. So as the peso strengthens against the dollar, we have a tax expense based on the fact that it takes less pesos to pay the debt. It has nothing to do with the JV.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "I thought I heard you say something about the JV, my apologies.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "This is Joe Householder. Sam, I think what you are talking about is also in the LNG business, there was a loss, $12 million due to the contracts that LNG has with RBS Sempra Commodities. It's a mark-to-market contract on the sale of the natural gas. And so that's in there every quarter. There is a mark-to-market, and gas prices went up, there is a loss.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "And that's just something in the prior structure that would have just netted out.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "This would have eliminated; company wise, it doesn't eliminate now. But it's been there every quarter. That one we don't really consider or not... that's going to be there as gas price goes up and down, it will be a gain sometimes and a loss sometimes. It's non-cash, and it will all turnaround as we start to sell the product. It's just basically represents a part of the marketing fee.", "Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Got it. I appreciate your patience.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "Okay.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have no additional questions at this time, and I'd like to turn the call back to Don Felsinger for any additional or closing comments.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, once again thanks to all of you for joining us for the second quarter 2008 call. If you have any follow-up questions, you know how to get a hold of Jeff, Glen, or Scott. Thanks, have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Martin. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Martin - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning. I am Jeff Martin and I want to thank you that you could joining us. I know it's a busy time that many of you are actually traveling or attending the EEI Conference in Phoenix.", "This morning we'll be discussing our third quarter 2008 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including, Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, President and CEO of our Utilities; and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You'll note that slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. Please remember this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. As you know, they involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. But future results may differ materially from those expressed on our call.", "These risks and uncertainties and assumptions are described at the bottom of today's press release, and are further discussed in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is also important also to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation today are shown on a diluted basis.", "And with that I'd now like to turn it over to Don, who will begin with slide 3.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Jeff. And again thanks to each of you for joining us.", "Here is a format for today's call. Mark Snell and I will start with the financial results, then I will update you on the status of some of our key business activities. And then, finally we'll close with any questions you have.", "Now to the financial results; earlier this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $308 million or $1.24 per share, compared with third quarter 2007 net income of $305 million or $1.15 per share. 2008 results benefited from a reduced share account due to the completion of the share repurchase program that we initiated in April.", "We're pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the first nine months of 2008. We had very strong results from the San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Gas, as well as our Generation, Pipelines and LNG business. Third quarter results were negatively impacted by our commodities segment. But when we look at the full year outlook for that business, we still expect earnings to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million.", "Now, let me hand it over to Mark. He'll take you through each of the business units financial results beginning with slide 4.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Don.", "At San Diego Gas & Electric, net income for the third quarter was the $123 million, which is the same as the year-ago quarter. But if you note the items listed on slide 4, you'll see that SDG&E benefited from $19 million on higher authorized margin in Q3 2008, a direct result of our California and FERC rate cases.", "Now please turn to slide 5. Southern California Gas' third quarter 2008 net income was $77 million, up from $63 million in the third quarter of 2007. About half of the increase was the benefit for retroactively applying higher revenues authorized in a recently filed rate case, with the other half coming from the resolution of a regulatory matter.", "Now let's go to slide 6; Sempra Commodities reported a net loss of $8 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared with $87 million of net income in the prior year's quarter. This is our second reporting period under our new joint venture with RBS and reflects our reduced ownership in the business.", "You'll recall that prior to the second quarter of this year, Sempra had 100% ownership of the Commodities business. The third quarter 2008 net loss included an after-tax loss of $3 million from our share of the equity earnings of RBS Sempra Commodities.", "The JV recorded only $60 million of trading margin for the quarter, which was impacted by a sharp decline in commodity prices and reduced liquidity at certain physical trading hub, as the number of companies pulled back and we adjusted to these new market conditions.", "Even though each of our product lines was adversely affected in the quarter, losses were limited to our power marketing book. Don will update you with some of the positive developments we're currently seeing in this business, but for now let's move to slide 7, where we will review how income from the joint venture with RBS is allocated.", "Here we show how income is allocated at the joint venture, both for the quarter and its first six months. A couple of highlights; first the joint venture posted a loss of $33 million during the quarter, after applying the income allocation methodology, the loss at Sempra was $29 million. Now Sempra's share of the loss was higher than you might expect due to the combination of the joint venture having such an outstanding second quarter, and the third quarter results coming in much lower than the prior period. More simply, we had to give back some of the allocations above of our preferred return for the year that were booked last quarter since we made these calculations on an annual basis.", "After adjusting to U.S. GAAP and for the impact of taxes, Sempra's share of the joint venture equity earnings for the quarter was a loss of $3 million. In the first six months since its formation, the joint-venture earned $706 million in margin on a mark-to-market basis, after operating expenses, the JV earned $301 million or a $195 million after tax. Sempra's after tax share of the earnings since April 1st is $90 million.", "Please move to slide 8. Third quarter net income for our Generation business increased significantly to $94 million compared with $58 million in the same quarter in 2007. The improvement in the third quarter of 2008 was due primarily to $25 million and higher mark-to-market earnings and $8 million and lower income tax expense as a result of Sempra Generation's recent solar investments.", "Please move to slide 9. Sempra Pipelines & Storage net income in the third quarter of 2008 doubled to $34 million compared with $17 million in the same period of 2007. Mexican pipeline operations contributed $12 million in the third quarter, compared with $4 million in the same quarter in 2007, the increase was primarily due to earnings from LNG related pipeline contracts.", "The Rockies Express West pipeline, which you'll recall went into service earlier this year, contributed $5 million of earnings in the quarter compared with a $2 million loss in the prior year. For the first nine months of 2008, net income increased to $84 million up from $50million in the same period in 2007. Year-to-date 2008 includes $17 million of earnings from Rockies Express compared with a loss of $4 million in 2007.", "Please turn to slide 10. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results. One point of interest here is that Sempra LNG recorded net income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared with the net loss of $4 million in the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily due to a mark-to-market gain on a natural gas marketing agreement with RBS Sempra Commodities.", "Now please turn to slide 11. Now I'd like to take some time to talk about our liquidity position and how the current economic environment could impact our business in 2009. First let's talk about our current liquidity. As of October 31st, we had $245 billion of cash and availability under our committed bank line. We have three committed credit facilities with total commitments of $4.3 billion from a group of 19 banks. These are multi-year credit lines that'll mature in August 2011, roughly $2 billion of those credit lines are being used today to support our commercial paper program and letters of credit.", "Now please turn to slide 12; what I'd like to do now is kind of walk through our funding needs through the end of 2009. This table reflects our current outlook for sources and uses of funds over the next 14 months. Total sources not including our bank lines are expected to be about $2.7 billion, while uses are projected to be about $3.7 billion. This does not include the $500 million share repurchase previously planned for next year.", "This result in a net funding requirement and a possible draw on our credit lines of $1 billion through the end of 2009. Keep in mind, this assumes that only debt issuances to occur during the period would be about $600 million in utility debt and the remarketing of $400 million of IDBs.", "Assuming the debt markets remained close for holding companies and non utilities through 2009, a highly likely outcome... highly unlikely outcome, excuse me, we could still expect to end 2009 with ample liquidity of $1.5 billion under this scenario.", "Now please turn to slide 13. In summary, we expect our current liquidity to cover our net funding needs through the end of 2009 by roughly 2.5 times. We also have the flexibility to defer some capital spending if necessary. Once again this outlook assumes we issued no debt outside of our utilities. This is highly unlikely. We are well positioned to make up through this tight spell in the debt markets with enough liquidity to support our operating businesses, complete construction of several major infrastructure projects, and lay the foundation for continued growth.", "Now please turn to slide 14. We are pleased with our financial results particularly in a difficult environment. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008, was up 8% over the same quarter last year. SDG&E, SoCalGas as well as our Generation, Pipelines, and L&G businesses all performed well. Results worked for at our commodities, but we don't expect to repeat performance in the fourth quarter and are actually pleased with the results so far through October.", "Last month we also completed a $1 billion share repurchase that began back in April. In total, 18.4 million shares were repurchased. In regards to the additional repurchases we have planned on starting early next year, we will continue to evaluate the debt markets, interest rates and other factors that may impact our business with the view towards making a decision on a follow-on share repurchase, when the debt market return to normal.", "Turning to the economy and its impact, Sempra, like all companies, is being affected by the current worldwide economic crises. The debt markets are expensive at best and closed entirely in some cases. Higher borrowing costs coupled with very low natural gas prices, which affect profitability of Sempra Generation and Sempra LNG could, if they remain unchanged, effect our profitability in 2009. Additionally, given the uncertainty at the commodity markets, and a lack of bank borrowings for energy infrastructure, which impact related hedging activity, growth at RBS's separate commodities could be dampened.", "At our Analyst Conference, we provided 2009 earnings guidance of $4.35 to $4.60 per share. We will update that guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call, which will be held in February of next year. In the interim, there are several factors in the current economic environment that could put pressure on our 2009 financial results and these include interest rates. If they remain at the 10% to 11% level for BBB borrowers and given our forecasted borrowings, it could impact our earnings by $0.10.", "Natural gas prices, if they continue in the $6 range that could impact us by $0.05. And if growth of our Commodities JV is not as we... robust as our original forecast, and we come in closer to the low end of the $300 million to $400 million earnings range we forecasted, it couldn't impact us by as much as $0.20.", "Since we are not quantifying any potential upsize, we are not changing our guidance at this time. We are just pointing out the limited range of downsize that could impact our earnings due to the extraordinary economic environment we are experiencing.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who'll begin with slide 15.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Mark just covered some of the considerations that could put pressure on our results in 2009. I also think it's important to talk about some of the positive considerations as well.", "First, we expect the business environment to improve in 2009 and a corresponding reduction in interest rates as lending activity returns to more normal levels. I am also very optimistic. I am also very optimistic about our commodity segment. It looks like this past October will be one of our best month ever with improved business activity and margins across business all lines.", "And longer term when you consider RBS is improving balance sheet and the potential to increase market share, we remain confident in the joint-venture's ability to produce strong risk adjusted returns overtime. Also our two utilities just posted their best quarter ever with $200 in income. So I think there is positive to build on for 2009.", "Now let me update you on some operational issues starting with our utilities. In the third quarter, we received a final decision on our general rate cases for SDG&E SoCalGas. The decision called for a revenue increase in 2008 that allowed us to book a $40 million retroactive benefit for the first six months of the year. More importantly, the decision also provides revenue certainties for 2011 with fixed revenue increases in each year.", "Turning to our smart meter programs, at SDG&E, we'll began our full scale installations early next year; and at SoCalGas, we filed for regulatory approval of a $1.1 billion program of which $900 million would be capital. We anticipate the program will be approved and installations to began in 2011. Also during the quarter we filed a request to develop a series of solar projects at SDG&E. This program would have initial target of 70 to 80 megawatts of solar electricity.", "Pending commission approval, SDG&E expects to add up to $250 million of rate base as these projects are developed over the next five years. The first installations are targeted to be operational as early as next year. As for the Sunrise Powerlink transmission project, a major milestone in the approval process was reached 10 days ago. On October 31st, the commission issued two draft decisions, one by the administration law judge and one by the assigned commissioner.", "Even though the proposed decision issued by the administrative law judge in the proceeding of recommended new generation for the San Diego region we believe that the commission will ultimately approve some variation of the recommendation made in the alternate decision by the assigned commissioner. A transmission line that takes a more southerly [ph] route and the one we originally proposed.", "We expect the commission to make a final decision in this proceeding by year end. Our preliminary estimated cost of the line is approximately $1.9 billion including estimates for the required litigation measures needed to reduce environmental impacts and provide rerouting in certain areas.", "Now please go to slide 16; what I'd like to do now is to take a moment to recap some of the projects we've recently completed or have under development, our LNG and pipelines and storage business. We completed the Energ\u00eda Costa Azul LNG terminal early this year as well as the expansion of a Bajanorte Pipeline, which connects to the facility.", "We've also started construction on nitrogen facility at the terminal. We are in the midst of developing a significant amount of salt cavern storage in the Gulf Coast region. The first project that we began developing in the region Liberty Gas Storage has been a challenge. We've had some sub-surface issues that have delayed completion. We're now evaluating whether we'll be able to correct these issues. If not, we may be required to take an impairment charge of approximately $65 million after tax or our 75% share of the project.", "Alternatively, if our corrective actions are successful, which we expect to know by the end of the fourth quarter, would expect to place the facility in the service in the first half of next year. Since we can develop three other salt zones in the Gulf, if we can't place Liberty in the service other than the one time charge, our ongoing storage earnings would not be significantly impacted.", "On October, the 1st, we closed the EnergySouth transaction, which now gives us two more storage projects in the region. First, the Bay Gas Storage is currently operating with the fully contracted capacity of over 11 Bcf and additional 5 Bcf is under construction with a 2010 in-service date. There are also plans to increase the facility's total capacity to 27 Bcf by the end of 2011.", "Mississippi Hub gas storage is the other project under development. Currently the facility's first step in the half Bcf of storage capacity is under construction and commitments are in place for 4 Bcf. Operations are slated to commence in 2010. There are also plans to increase the total capacity of Mississippi Hub to 30 Bcf by year-end 2015. Sempra's ownership interest in the project is 60%. Sempra's share of the capital cost to build out the total storage of both Bay Gas and Mississippi Hub is expected to be about $500 million.", "And finally, regarding our 25% interest in Rockies Express Pipeline, we are experiencing higher costs than we'd originally forecast for the eastern leg of that pipeline, mostly around labor and some of the workaround issues that were required as part of the permitting process. As a result, the revised cost estimate for Rockies Express is approximately $6 billion. Our share of the equity to support the project is now estimated at $750 million, and we expect annual distributions from that investment of roughly $80 million to $90 million per year.", "Now for a quick summary, please go to the last slide. I'm extremely pleased with the strength of our financial results for the quarter and came down for the first nine months of the year. When you step back, I think our success is in large part a function of how we allocate capital and manage risk.", "First, we don't commit capital to projects until we have contracts. Secondly, our utility investments are in locations with positive regulations where we aren't exposed to commodity prices or sales volumes and we have high returns on invested capital. Furthermore, we have pension plans that don't expose our shareholders when we need to make contributions to increased funding. Outside our utilities, we have paid the long dated contracts like you see in our natural gas infrastructure businesses, since this provides our shareholders with certainty of cash flows.", "And lastly on the commodities front, we took a proactive approach that placed us in a unlimited partnership position, where our equity is capped and we bear no liquidity risk. These are the type of things that helped businesses like ours consistently perform well. Going forward, we'll continue to be execution-focused and look forward to updating our 2009 guidance when you join us on our fourth quarter call.", "And with that, let me open up the call and take any questions that you may have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes. Good morning.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Don, Mark, I'm a little confused about the Commodities business. I would expect that with competitors dropping off like flies and volatility increasing, that it wasn't the...", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lasan, let me interrupt you and ask you if you could maybe get closer to the phone, we can't hear you here.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Is this better?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's much better.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. With competitors dropping off like flies and volatility and gas prices, it seems like a minimum branch-to-branch. I mean how is it that the Commodities didn't do well in the third quarter? What's specifically the type of [Ph], how did the loss get created?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Allow me to say Lasan that in the third quarter, we saw a very unusual commodity activity with prices basically all going down across all commodity lines. And we found ourselves in a position in the Northwest, where we had very little liquidity. And in the process of rebalancing our position, we ended up taking a loss in the power book in that region.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "We categorize that as a very unusual situation, something that has been not likely to be occurring frequently?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a position that we won't find ourselves and again.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And... but going forward then, can we make in conjunction [Ph] that even though volumes may stabilize or even come down, the margins are to increase straight across the...", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lasan, back to that point, I am just... I have never been as excited about the commodity businesses I am today. We saw a lot of people exit out of the space. We had a very unusual quarter with just loss of liquidity and prices declining, but I think going forward with the joint venture we have with RBS even though, we don't have as much liquidity in the market, because there are fewer players, it plays very well to our strength. As both the financial and physical player, this is the space we want to be in right now, we just had a great month in October.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Excellent, excellent. Don, this is the kind of situation for internationally economic when, Sempra's thinks to be able to pull some interesting acquisition moves and take advantage of some of the system modulation in the marketplace. Kind of... give us a sense of what you're thinking about in terms of valuations and assets in the acquisition market if you would?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would just say from a growth perspective that as I just went through a one down, we have a lot of capital projects that we are either in the final throws of completing or about the launch, and so a lot of organic growth. From the standpoint of the marketplace, there is no doubt that as you look around at the landscape, there are a lot of companies that have depressed equity prices. And if you look at the type of things that we would have an interest and just go back and look at what we did with EnergySouth, and I think that would kind of project to you the type assets we're looking for, something in the natural gas space that plays to the line of infrastructure we want to be in. So I think we are well positioned with organic growth, acquisition opportunities. And as Mark mentioned we have... always as a back staff, have the ability to go back and buyback shares when the market looks favorable.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Mark, can you give us update on what the mark-to-market non-cash mark-to-market does for the third quarter?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am sorry, Lasan, I just didn't... I didn't get that, could you repeat it?", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "I am sorry. Third quarter non-cash mark-to-market adjustments?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Third quarter non-cash mark-to-market adjustment.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In which business?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "In Generation?", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Straight across the board for the Generation, for Commodities, for whatever, LNG?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Lasan, I think what we thought was sort of the inverse of the asset commodities business, both at Generation and LNG, we have some hedges emplaced, and those hedges came roughly into the money as commodity prices dropped and that's why we have some pick ups across the board there.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Lasan.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Goldenberg of Luminous Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Good morning.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "I guess we've been already has done accustomed to excellent operations from Sempra. So I guess it's a little surprising to hear about your difficulties with the storage. Can you expand a little as to what exactly this with, why... it was unforeseen and what there remains to be figured out as to whether going to be a write-off or what do you can actually put on service?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me start off and I'll ask Neal to follow on here. But in our Liberty Gas Storage development, we ended up buying two existing caverns that have been mined for other purposes. And so in the process of going through and doing the sub-service development, we've run across some issues that we think will cause those storage caverns to have some problems.", "Now we're currently working through some potential solutions, we haven't given up yet on those. But as we mentioned if in fact, we do have to walk away from these facilities, our share of any write-down would be around $60 million, $65 million. But that is dependent upon getting some more information. The positive thing here, Michael, is that we do not need the storage field to go forward with the acquisition we've made with Bay Gas and Mississippi Hub plus other projects we have in the Liberty region, we can go forward and build out this business with minimal impacts on earnings going forward.", "Neal, do you want to...?", "Neal E. Schmale - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I would just underline what you just said about how good the future of this business looks with the opportunities we have at Liberty South and with the recent acquisition. But to get you a very... the question about the cavern and question, the fundamental issues there is, we have 13.3 inch [ph] in the casing through a whole we drilled into one of the caverns, and we've been unable to get the right kind of pressure test to assure that 13.3 inch casings, what we're looking at now is running another string of 10.75 inch casing into that, cementing the new string, 10.75 inch casing and try, and try and effect to see a lab way [ph]. But we don't have a lot of space in the well board to do that, and we also have to make adjustment around whether or not long term and the objections were on cycle. We think that will be a satisfactory solution and what we are doing now is engineering studies and studies of the caverns around those issues, and we should have those sorted out before the end of the fourth quarter.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But the lesson here is this: this is one of those facilities, where we win them [Ph] and try to take a preexisting cavern and make it capable of holding high pressure natural gas. In the other projects, we have in the region, we are going to go into a salt firm and mine our own caverns. And so we will have much more confidence in the integrity of the caverns. And the lesson here is don't go by cavern that was used for something else and trying to think you can store gas in it.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Got it. And one more question, its about the REX pipeline. When you said the new cost is $6 billion, which leg... continue with just clarify, which leg the $6 billion is for whether its REX East or the additional light of REX for these?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's mainly for the eastern portion of the pipeline. The western portion is in service. The costs are basically recorded. As we got the final FERC decision and the environmental mitigation that we had to go through the additional routing that we had to take place, and some of the mitigation measures of what's driving this cost.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "But that's through Ohio, right? It has nothing to do with the proposed pipeline down the road [ph]", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right,this is an existing pipeline through Ohio.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminous Management", "Got it. Okay, that's what I wanted to make sure. Thank you very much.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Michael.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hey Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Hi. Just to clarity in the Liberty Gas storage, can you just, can you quantify the size of the cavern relative to the size of the entire Liberty Gas storage project?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The two caverns were 17 Bcf.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And the cavern that is, could be impaired is how large?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "11 Bcf, I believe.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "11 Bcf of the 17 Bcf could be impaired?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Potentially, the full 17 Bcf, that's what we are looking at right now. But I once again would reiterate that these particular caverns, we have other projects that would fully replace the capacity we're talking about here.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Sure. And on the Powerlink project, the alternative route that's have been proposed by the commissioner, the science commissioner on this project, what the... how would change the timing of a potential on a completion and engineering and construction of the Powerlink versus what you guys had if they are planning for previously?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Debbie and I were taking before the call and we are assuming that if we get a final commission decision, which would expect before the end of this year, that we'll have that line in operation in 2012.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. Is it still follow the same sort of FERC transmission rules in terms of getting cash return on equipment, is that right?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And so that the cost of project now would be roughly $1.9 billion, is that what you are estimating?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "This route is a little more expense and so we're looking at another couple of $100 million.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, understood. And I wonder if you can give us a little bit of an update on the LNG market. I know the last year the number of cargos coming to the U.S. has been pretty slim, but given the economic situation around the world, I am wondering if you can update us on it? Is there any change in the projected amount of volumes that might be coming into the U.S. at some point in time?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it is amazing how quickly the world market changes in a three months period. But we actually feel very optimistic about the ability now to get spot cargos into the Gulf with the worldwide economic issues. As we look at the traditional landing areas in Asia and Europe. Our sense is that we're going to end up with more cargos in the Gulf. We are starting to see some activity now. I can't give you, kind of a firm estimate of how many cargos will be coming to North America and what was otherwise thought [Ph]. But I think by the end of this year, I will have a better sense of that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks for the time, guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Good morning, guys. Can you hear me?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Paul, we hear you fine.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I wanted to touch base with you on an article that came out in today's [ph] press indicating that you think government's potential ownership of RBS could impact the JV, could you just sort of tell us from your perspective what you see the potential impact?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me give you some color on that. And then I'll have Mark follow through on this. But every signal that we have seen from RBS is that this is the space they still want to be in. It's such a great compliment to their banking business with all the asset they finance. But if you are referring to the fact that we're planning go out and do on equity offering and they've gone through and done with this portfolio fleet disclosures, where they may have to access in joint ventures, I think that's just what it is, a standard boiler plate language.", "From the standpoint of our joint venture, we have a clause in there that neither party can sell until four years out from the formation of joint venture, but I think that's kind of wrong approach to look at this. This is a business, it's in a space they want to be in. It's had a great month here that all the bankers that are out loaning money love the fact that we have the ability to hedge some of these transactions that they are doing with commodities. And we feel very upbeat about where we are. Mark?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, just direct to your point on the article that you saw the quotes were actually from outside analyst, not from the people inside the bank. But what they were referring to was some JV agreements that they have, and I haven't read them all, but I know ours, have changed the control provision at the bank. So the government were to take a such a large percentage of this offering that they are doing that it triggered to change a control provision, it could cause some issues with some of their joint ventures.", "With respect to our joint venture in particular, it really doesn't cause any issue. The change in control provisions within our joint venture are relatively benign. It has some language around convents not to compete stuff with us, but it's really almost kind of mood point, it doesn't really matter. And the more important thing in our join venture agreement as, Don mentioned, which was the both neither side to really contemplate selling for four years. So essentially we have to be involved in that kind of the decision.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. So they can't not just laterally get out of the UK government as some sort of perspective as in order of the bank, some change in direction, I mean realize that that may not be a likely outcome, but just trying to get a better picture on this.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right, they don't have a contractual right to do that. And so, I think at the end of the day, there are lot other commitments.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Then with respect to Sempra Generation, and I guess... I apologize I got a little bit distracted when Lasan asked the question about the total mark-to-market impact. Don said that Sempra generation, but it's higher company as a whole, what is the non-cash mark-to-market impact? I'm sorry I didn't get the answer.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hang a just second while we look at up,", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Whenever you get them, I'm moving on that [ph]. The other question that I finally have is on the stock buyback, there was some expectation, I believe for some of the buyback in your 2009 outlook and now it sounds like that might be held up by your... while we see what happens in the markets in general. Just I mean, if you can elaborate a little bit further, I mean you mentioned that some other company's stock prices were down and that might be opportunities. But as a last resort, you might obviously look at buying back stock, I don't know if I am quoting for data, but that's why I thought your comments were.", "Your stock has come down as well, obviously and what's the thought process I guess in terms of what that looks like vis-\u00e0-vis other. And also in terms of dividend growth, has that outlook changed at all since you guys were sort of a little bit more, thinking a little bit more aggressively about that earlier in the year?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me talk about stock buyback. It's not our last resort, I think stock buyback is something we would line up along with everything else we are doing. We have organic growth with projects we've already identified and have spending plans lined out form.", "When we look opportunities in the marketplace, we are seeing everybody having declining equity prices and so we have to go through and look at any of those opportunities and whether they make sense in today's debt markets. And then thirdly, we have the option to have a stock buyback. So I would line all three of those up and we will do whatever makes the most sense for our shareholders.", "And regarding our dividend policy, our Board has done nothing to signal any change. And they act upon this once a year. We will have a robust discussion again. But I don't expect any change.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Paul, this is Mark. To answer your question, we have $41 million in mark-to-market gains, $28 million in Generation, $13 million at LNG. And then of course, those are offset by the... some of the losses we have in mark-to-market at the commodities business.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "When we look at the cash flow statement, where do the mark-to-market gains, the non-cash gains show up. Is there any line item or are they sort of... I am just looking in general, I am having little difficulty in terms of locating where they would show up. But is it... I don't know, where are they?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "They would show up in changes in working capital.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. So, they are all within less than a year?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Absolutely.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. I really appreciate it guys. Thank you", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll going next to Chip Moore, Canaccord Adams.", "Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams", "Thanks. Quick question on you smart meter program. You indicated earlier that San Diego Gas & Electric would start to point early next year; just wondering if that's on track with the original February timeframe?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It is. And let me have Debbie talk about what our next tests are?", "Debra L. Reed - President and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co.", "Yes, we have... this is Debbie. We have installed 5,000 meters already and we are testing them MCL [ph]. We will begin full deployment in February of 2009 for SDG&E. And then we'll also filed for SoCalGas smart meters and we're hoping to get a regulatory approval for that in the middle of 2009. And then, we'll begin the work on the SoCalGas side. That's about $900 million of capital on the SoCalGas side if we were to get that approved.", "Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams", "All right, thank you. Appreciate the color.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Tameron [ph] Wachovia Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning guys, thanks for the time. Just following up on the question about the JV; so there is no way for RBS to curb funding of the JV or do anything to slow it down, they are committed on to this contract for four years to fund whatever is required and to grow the businesses as you and MC said?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Dave, I mean nothing is a guarantee unlike, RBS will do what RBS wants to do. They have a contractual arrangement with us and every signal we have seen is very positive about this business to get something that will enhance their basic thinking business. And so it's our expectation and as the expectation of all the people at RBS we interface with that they want to capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace right now to grow this business. And we are seeing nothing to the contrary.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. So you feel like you have a full strength of their balance sheet and....", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes we do.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And I know when there was some discussions, I thought a month or so would go that there were still from contracts that hadn't been shifted over to JV. Are and those all shifted over now. Is every thing in?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No we've got.... we have some counterparties that reside in the U.S. and reside in Canada, and RBS is still getting regulatory approval in Canada. As soon as they have that regulatory approval, we will shift those contracts over to RBS's balance sheet. That's expected to take place around May of next year.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Let me add to that, David, that all of those contracts, they are all in... all of our commitments are guarantees, are indemnified by RBS. And I think the concern early on I think when there were some concerns that RBS might not survive, I think most people now expect the vast majority would believe that that's not an issue any longer with the cash infusion that's been made by the British government, so we fully expect to know that they would honor their commitments, and so we're fully indemnified by the bank.", "Unidentified Analyst", "But that's not really an issue any more. Okay.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That's helpful. All right, thanks for the time.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll got next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Hi guys, just a follow-up. Mark, you said there were some mark-to-market losses at the JV. Maybe you can quantify that and look at the operating income, pretax distributable income of the JV, what would the non-cash impact?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Faisel, I think it's clearly we have... obviously everything is the JV, is on a mark-to-market basis.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Right.", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It came up of the negative earnings for the year, we must have had mark-to-market losses. But it's... so if you actually look at the table that are attached to the press releases, you'll see on the margins, we did have a large negative margin in the power book business. But other than that, the rest of our businesses were profitable.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Is it fair to say that some portion of that power loss could be non-cash?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ultimately, all of these things kind of go into cash, but they're probably non-cash at the moment. But that doesn't mean that ultimately it won't turn around. And most of this book turns around as you know in a two year period at the moment. Now some of those power fields are a little bit longer. They may go out three years or four years. But the impact is... we don't try to quantify that so much any more, because of the liquidity issue with the bank providing the liquidity. But at the end of the day, those losses will manifest themselves in cash over the next two or three years.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And Faisel, as I mentioned earlier, we saw a turnaround in October and actually had just one of the best Octobers we've had in the 10 years we've had this business.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Has the size of the book changed at all? I know you guys don't disclose that; is there anything?", "Mark A. Snell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It has changed, it's gotten a little bit bigger. We've... it's been expanded a little with some of the business that we are getting on the hedging activity. It's one of the things that we talked about. That's been a real high point. But the gas... but beyond that the it's roughly the same.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "On the cash flow statement, can you guys just comment on how the housing and the working capital and equity earnings have been... large changes in working capital and...", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Faisel, I am going to ask you, we're having difficulty on this. I think it's our phone system here. But could you repeat that please?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Yes, sure. On the cash flow statement, for the nine months you got equity earnings of negative $228 million and changes in working capital negative 408, can you comment a little bit on how those may be reverse or change overtime?", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me ask Joe Householder, see if he can make his...", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "Can you hear me okay?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Yes, I can hear you fine.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "The equity earnings is $228 million; that's just reversing out the equity running. $145 million of that is from RGS, $30 million from Rockies, and rest from South America. So then when that turns into cash, it comes in below. So, you'll see now, we will do wind down just below the working capital distribution for RBS. So that was the first distribution we've got after the second quarter.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, understood.", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "Cash flow coming in.", "The working capital, it's kind of split up among four business units, SDG&E was $66 million of it. It's balancing account changes; SoCal was $115 million, mostly in inventory changes. $56 million [ph] of over Sempra Commodities just going away to venture, and about $90 million of it was at LNG, mostly for inventory acquiring cargos.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, understood", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And Faisel, this will get a little bit more clear next year when... because we have the transaction with RBS this year.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Right.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That kind of marks it up on the first nine months, but after we get that, the effects of that out of the system, it will be a little simpler.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "And the cash could distribute a partnership that the end of the year, is that right?", "Joseph A. Householder - Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer", "It comes clearly tax distributions and then the rest around February, end of February.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. Understood, thanks guys.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Felsinger for any additional and closing remarks.", "Donald E. Felsinger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks to all of you for taking time out of your schedule today to join us on this call.", "And let me just go back and reiterate that we are extremely pleased with where we are today. We started this year out with earnings guidance of $3.65 to $3.85. We raised that to $3.80 to $4. And as we look at the next year with $4.35 to $4.60 of earnings. We feel good about that, but we've given you what we think are some of the worst case scenarios that could impact that guidance for next year. We'll have a chance to refresh this with you at the end of the quarter in our February call.", "And thank you again for joining us.

Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Martin. ", "", "Jeff Martin", "Good morning!  I want to take a quick moment and thank each you for joining us.  A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including Don Felsinger, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, President and CEO of our Utilities; and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You\u2019ll note that slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement.  Please remember that this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  As you know, they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, so future results may differ materially from those expressed on our call.", "These risks, uncertainties, and assumptions are described at the bottom of today\u2019s press release and are further discussed in the company\u2019s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It is also important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation this morning are shown on a diluted basis.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Don, who will begin with slide three.", "", "Don Felsinger", "Thank you for joining us.  Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $198 million or $0.80 per share compared with $244 million or $0.98 per share in the same period last year.  It\u2019s important to note that our second quarter results include the negative impact of the $64 million or $0.26 writeoff related to the Liberty Gas Storage project.  For the first six months of 2009, earnings increased to $514 million or $2.09 per share, up from $486 million or $1.90 per share.", "Our results for the first 6 months of 2009 without the impact of the one-time writeoff were up 19% over last year, a very strong performance in the midst of a difficult economic climate.  The combination of our strong first half results and several new revenue drivers starting up in the second half of the year has allowed us to reaffirm our previously announced guidance range of $4.35 per share to $4.60 per share.  ", "It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the guidance we provided in March of this year did not include a negative impact of the Liberty writedown.  We feel the increased expectations we have for other areas of the business should mitigate the impact of the $64 million write-off.", "Now let me hand it over to Mark Snell, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with slide four.", "Mark Snell", "At San Diego Gas and Electric, earning for the second quarter were $70 million, up from earnings of $61 million in the year ago quarter.  Second quarter 2009 results benefited from $18 million of higher operating margins.  Second quarter 2008 results also benefited from $8 million of regulatory awards.", "At Southern California Gas, second quarter 2009 earnings were $65 million, an increase from $56 million in the second quarter of 2008.  The improvement was primarily due to higher operating margins.  Before we move on, I\u2019d like to update you on a couple of items related to the wildfire litigation at San Diego Gas and Electric.", "Since our last call, SDG&E reached an agreement with numerous homeowners insurance company plaintiffs settling a portion of the wildfire claims.  Under the agreement, SDG&E will pay the insurane companies $740 million to settle approximately $1.3 billion of claims.  Discussions are continuing with the remaining homeowner insurance companies for settlement on substantially the same terms.", "We currently have $940 million reserved for these exposures, offset by a like amount of insurance receivable.  In addition to the claims of the homeowners insurance carriers, there are a variety of other claims that may take several years to be fully resolved.  We do not have sufficient information to estimate the amount of exposure to these remaining claims.  Therefore, no reserves or offsetting insurance receivables have been recorded.", "Now, let\u2019s go to slide 5.  Sempra Commodities' earnings in the second quarter of 2009 were $85 million compared with $130 million in the prior year's quarter.  Second quarter 2008 results benefited from a $67 million gain on the sale of the business to the joint venture with RBS, and that was partially offset by $30 million in charges for litigation and tax matters.", "For the first half of the year, commodity earnings have increased to $199 million, up from $189 million in the first half of 2008.  The first half of 2008 included the net benefit of the one-time items I just mentioned as well as Sempra Energy\u2019s 100% ownership of the commodities business in the first quarter.  ", "While the commodities business as a whole continues to post good results, the price and volatility of natural gas and power which actually represents our two largest business lines have been relatively flat.  Low natural gas prices coupled with exceptionally low basis differentials across the country have reduced the number of profitable trading opportunities.  Since the third quarter is traditionally a slow quarter for trading, we don\u2019t expect much improvement until the fourth quarter; however, our oil and metals businesses continue to do well.", "Now let us move to slide 6.  Here we show how income is allocated at the joint venture for the quarter and the first half of the year. A couple of highlights: First, the joint venture had income of $142 million during the quarter.  After applying the income allocation methodology, the distributable income to Sempra was $102 million. Adjusting to US GAAP and for the impact of the income taxes, Sempra's joint venture equity earnings for the quarter were $87 million, compared with $93 million in the same quarter of \u201908. ", "For the first six months of 2009, the joint venture had income of $296 million, and Sempra\u2019s equity earnings were $203 million.  These results reflect the stabilizing effect of how profits are allocated in the joint venture, and this has removed much of the volatility of our earnings.  In periods with low joint venture, we receive a higher overall percentage of the allocated profits, and in time periods with higher joint venture earnings, we receive a lower overall percentage of the profits.", "Now, let\u2019s move to slide seven.  Second quarter earnings for our Generation business were $33 million, up from $23 million in the same quarter in 2008.  Second quarter 2009 was impacted by $8 million of lower earnings from operations as the result of lower market prices.  Second quarter 2008 earnings included $20 million in mark to market losses on forwards contracts.", "Now let\u2019s move to slide 8.  Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded a loss of $27 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with earnings of $24 million for the same quarter last year.  The loss in 2009 includes a $64 million impact of the writeoff related to the Liberty Gas Storage that Don mentioned earlier.  Second quarter 2009 results benefited from about $6 million of higher earnings from our Mexican pipeline operations.  ", "Now please turn to slide 9.  This slide provides a summary of our business unit results.  I would like to highlight a couple of things here.  Sempra LNG recorded a loss of $12 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with a loss of $28 million in the prior year.  The improvement was primarily due to the new revenues from our contract with Shell, offset by startup costs, ongoing operating expenses, and pipeline fees paid to Sempra Pipelines and Storage.  We also had $9 million in lower mark to market losses on a marketing agreement with RBS-Sempra commodities as well as lower Mexican taxes.", "At Parents & Other, we recorded a loss of $16 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of $22 million in the same quarter in 2008. The improvement was primarily due to higher tax expense in the second quarter of 2008.  ", "Now turn to slide 10.  We are really pleased with our results for the quarter and the first half of the year.  Excluding the impact of Liberty Storage write-off, results were up by 7% from the second quarter of last year and 19% over the first half of 2008.  We\u2019ve also had strong operating cash flow led by $375 million in cash we\u2019ve already received this year from RBS Sempra Commodities.  These cash dividends from the joint venture are helping to fund our infrastructure build-out program which in turn will deliver consistent earnings and cash flow for years into the future, and with over $800 million in cash on our balance sheet and $3.6 billion available under our credit line, we have a very strong liquidity position.", "Also during the quarter, I\u2019d like to point out, we issued over $1 billion of new debt at rates between 6% to 6.5%.  ", "And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with slide 11.", "", "Don Felsinger", "Now let me update you on some of our business activities, and I\u2019ll start with our utilities.  Regarding Sunrise Powerlink transmission project, the California Public Utilities Commission recently reaffirmed its December 2008 decision of approving the project.  During the quarter, we continued our pre-construction activities and expect to start construction next summer on this $1.9 billion project in order to have it in place in the second half of 2012.  We\u2019ve already received approvals from the CPUC and Bureau of Land Management and expect the final major approval from the US Forest Service later this year.", "Turning to our Smart Meter program, at SDG&E, we have now installed more than 50,000 meters, and at year end we expect to have over 200,000 meters installed with a goal of completing the installation program by year end 2011.", "At SoCalGas, we\u2019ve filed with the CPUC for a program to install 6 million gas meters by 2016, and we expect to receive a final decision from the commission in the latter part of this year.  ", "On the Generation side of our utility business, we\u2019ll be putting a new peaking plant into service next month\u2014the 48 MW Miramar 2 facility which will be co-located with another peaker that SDG&E owns and operates.  The addition of this plant will help meet higher summer power demand. ", "Please go to the next slide.  Now, I\u2019ll move to some of the projects we have under development at our infrastructure businesses.  At Sempra Generation, in April we announced a 48 MW solar expansion projection that will be located adjacent to our existing El Dorado solar facility.  Earlier this week, we announced that we signed a 20-year agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric where they purchased all the power generated by the plant.  We expect to start construction later this year and to complete the project in 2011.", "Now for a quick update on the Rockies Express Pipeline where we have a 25% ownership interest, on June 29th, a major milestone was reached where REX-East began service to the Lebanon hub in Ohio with a current capacity of 1.6 billion cubic feet per day.  Construction on the easternmost portion of the line continues, and completion of the line to Clarington, Ohio, as well as increasing capacity to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day is expected late this year.", "Now go to slide 14.  At our Cameron LNG receipt terminal, we have completed construction, and commercial operations began this week.  We\u2019re now earning revenue under our contract with Eni which is for 40% of the terminal\u2019s capacity.  The associated Cameron pipeline is also complete and generating revenue from a contract with Eni.  We are now the only company to own and operate LNG receipt terminals serving both the Pacific and Gulf Coast of North America.  ", "Before I move on, I would like to also give you some more color on the Liberty Gas Storage project at Pipelines & Storage.  As many of you know, Liberty Gas Storage is a development project in Louisiana for salt cavern natural gas storage facilities.  Sempra Pipelines and Storage owns 75% of Liberty, and we have a partner that owns the remaining 25%.  As we have discussed in past quarters, we\u2019ve experienced some service issues at the northern facility.  This quarter, we reported a $64 million write-off after determining that this portion of the project will not provide future economic benefit.  We\u2019re still moving forward with the development of an additional 17 billion cubic feet of capacity in our southern location in Cameron Parish.", "What I\u2019d like to do now is remind you of some of the key events from a revenue generating perspective that are happening at our LNG and pipelines and storage businesses.  As many of you know, we\u2019ve been investing heavily in our natural gas infrastructure businesses over the last five years, and many of the projects that we\u2019ve been developing are now coming on line and providing new sources of revenue.  ", "We\u2019re now seeing the benefit of new revenue from REX-East service to Lebanon and from the start of a long-term capacity contrast with Eni on the Cameron Pipeline.  Cameron LNG has just started operations, and we\u2019re now earning revenue under the Eni contract.  In June, we announced an agreement with the RasGas Liquefaction project in Qatar to bring LNG to the Cameron terminal, and we could receive cargos into our terminal from RasGas through the end of 2010.  ", "In addition, at our Energia Costa Azul terminal, revenues under our contract with the LNG project will also begin later this quarter, and finally in the fourth quarter, the REX-East pipeline should be completed, as well as a nitrogen facility that we\u2019re building at the Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal which will also provide additional income.", "Please now move to the last slide, and what I\u2019d like to do here is just conclude by saying that I\u2019m pleased with our second quarter and first half results.  Even after the impact of the write-off of our Liberty Storage assets, we\u2019re still on track to meet our financial goals for the year.  I think what I\u2019ve just said says a lot about our business model and the growth platform we\u2019ve put together.  ", "This is a great time at Sempra, when we have several major infrastructure projects coming on line delivering incremental cash flow and earnings, and at the same time, we\u2019re ramping up investment in our California utility businesses on the front end of the largest capital program that SDG&E and SoCalGas have ever undertaken.  These utility investments also have the benefit of delivering earnings immediately and will provide cash flow well into the future.  ", "Let me end by stating that this is truly an exciting time at Sempra, and set the stage for strong growth in the future years, and with that, let me now open up the call and take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator instructions)  We will take our first question from Leslie Rich \u2013 Columbia Management.", "Leslie Rich \u2013 Columbia Management", "The Copper Mountain Solar Project, what\u2019s the capex involved in that, and when would that start?  Is it starting construction in 2010, or is that underway now?", "Don Felsinger", "We\u2019ve just filed that contract with the CPUC, and we expect to get approval from them sometime at the end of this year.  We\u2019ll have Neal go through and talk about the capital requirements.", "Neal Schmale", "On the solar projects, we haven\u2019t typically estimated the exact capital cost of these particular projects fundamentally for competitive reasons, but the cost of this will be very consistent with what we\u2019ve spent on the first 10 MW that we put in place last year.", "Leslie Rich \u2013 Columbia Management", "Is it already in your Capex forecast?", "Neal Schmale", "Yes.", "", "Leslie Rich \u2013 Columbia Management", "In terms of Cameron, I guess the agreement with Eni is that they can send both there, if they feel like it.  Do you have a sense of what kind of volumes to expect for the rest of the year?", "Don Felsinger", "You\u2019re talking about the capacity contract that Eni has at Cameron?", "Leslie Rich \u2013 Columbia Management", "No, I\u2019m not.  I\u2019m talking about RasGas.", "Don Felsinger", "RasGas has the option of bringing their gas to our terminal.  How much they actually bring I think will be a function of worldwide market.  We\u2019re fairly optimistic, Leslie, when you look at just what\u2019s going on in the world that incremental supply is coming on line, and net-net will have to end up in North America, and this is all upside to that plan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rebecca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", "Rebecca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", " ", "Did your previous guidance include taking a write-down on the Liberty, and do you expect that in the original guidance?", "Don Felsinger", "We did not.", "Rebecca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", "So, this is effectively raising guidance.  My second question is can you just talk a little bit about lots of noise with the CFTC regulating commodities markets.  How do you guys think this could possibly shake out and how it impacts the JV?", "Don Felsinger", "There is obviously a very rigorous debate going on, and I think the objective of Congress is to try and regulate or put a stop to a lot of speculative trading going on.  When we think about our business model, we really do a lot of physical delivery of commodities, plus we do hedging activities for customers that need to hedge their supplies or hedge their purchases.  So I sense that something is going to happen this year.  I think the impact on our business is not going to be as impactful as it could be on those people that are just strictly out there doing screening trading, but let me ask Mark to give some color to his perspectives on this.", "Mark Snell", "This is something obviously we\u2019ve been following pretty closely, and the closer you follow it, the more you realize that the amount of agreement is not really that close on a lot of these issues, but I do think that a couple of things will happen which is there is a definitely a movement to increase the amount of capital that counterparities have with respect to the kinds of trading, and there will be a movement to put as much of the derivative trading action that includes commodities as well as other financial derivatives on exchanges, which will create margining requirements.  I think the push from the commodities traders and us in particular is that there is a recognition that these markets were effectively set up for end-users, i.e., producers, power plants, and those kinds of companies that use these markets to hedge their output or to hedge their raw materials, and I think from that perspective, I believe that business will probably get some kind of exemption from the margining requirements so that they can continue to do that, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s core to our business.  With a lot of these, we see these as real benefit, our merger with RBS and the joint venture because I think that having the kind of capital that a commercial bank has behind the business will be the kind of thing that people will have to have, and I think for dealing with the customers, our ability to extend credit to those kinds of end-users will be critical to keep the market functioning.  All in all, we pretty much support the activities around more transparency and the elimination of systemic risk, and we\u2019re just here trying to protect our customers in this legislative battle that\u2019s going on, but I think generally speaking we feel that this is probably going to come out and be fine for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ella Vuernick\u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", " ", "Ella Vuernick\u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "LNG and the commodities business, do you see LNG coming to the US in the second half of \u201909, and I wanted to see if you had any color as to how much you see, what the timing looks like, and what the ramp of that acceleration may look like?", "Don Felsinger", "I\u2019d go back to my earlier comment, and this is strictly an observation from my standpoint that with the global economy like it is, when you kind of add up the increases and decreases outside North America, it\u2019s a net zero, and so any LNG that would ramp up this year would end up coming into North America.  The ramp-up of that is what\u2019s in question\u2014whether we end up at the end of this year with getting another 4 BCF or another 6 BCF of supply is really a function of how quickly people commission their plants and these plants into operation and start making deliveries, but what I come back to again is that our model is based upon having long-term contracts which we do with the majority of our capacity in Mexico and in Louisiana, and anything that happens with spot cargos coming into either facility is an upside for us.  It\u2019s not in our plan.", "Ella Vuernick\u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You had mentioned in your comments that third quarter is typically a slower quarter for the commodities JV, and you expect to see some improvements in the fourth quarter.  I wanted to see if you had any further color that you could share with us about what you forecast for the rest of this year.  I know this is difficult to do.", "Don Felsinger", "I\u2019d just say that we\u2019ve owned this business for almost 12 years now, and it seems like the last part of summer is always a slow time in the commodities business, and if you go back and look at our performance for the last 10-12 years, the third quarter has always been one of our lowest earning quarters, and so that comment is because of the fact that nothing has changed in the market place.  A lot of people go on vacation, not a lot of business gets conducted, and we just see the impact of that.  It wasn\u2019t anything else about the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", " ", "Given what\u2019s happened to the demand for electricity down in the Southeastern corridor of the US, can you talk about how this impacts the potential need in the next 5-6 years or so for natural gas storage projects and whether that has any impact on your spending plans for Mississippi at Bay Gas?", "Don Felsinger", "Michael, there is no doubt that we\u2019re in a time period right now where gas demand is off for several factors\u2014the economy, the amount of gas used for electric generation, industrial requirements for natural gas.  Our philosophy going forward with these storage projects is that before we spend incremental capital, we take a look at the market and see what the market is willing to contract for, and if the market is willing to buy gas storage, then we move forward.  We\u2019ll continue to test the market, but our sense is that people look to see a lot of volatility and seasonality in the market place, and that\u2019s why storage comes into place, so even though consumption and demand overall may be down, just the seasonal variations are enough for people to want to have more storage.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you update us in terms of timing and which of the projects down in that region in terms of major storage projects?  Any changes at all to what you disclosed in your 10-K or maybe it was the disclosure right around the time you did the Energy South deal?", "Don Felsinger", "Let me have Neal just walk you through what we have down there, the development status, what\u2019s under contract and so on.", "Neal Schmale", "Just by way of summary, we have in the Gulf Coast area we\u2019re developing three projects that when they\u2019re all done would have a total capacity of around 74 billion cubic feet, and three projects are for Bay Gas, where there is 11.4 BCF currently operating and that\u2019s fully contracted.  There is 5 BCF at Bay Gas which is under construction.  It\u2019ll be in service late 2010, and of that 3.2 BCF is contracted.  Now, the potential ultimate capacity of Bay Gas is 27 BCF.  That\u2019s Bay Gas.  Mississippi Hub, the second one has 15 BCF under construction, 4 BCF is contracted, and we expect first cavern in service.  The ultimate capacity is 30 BCF.  Finally, Liberty South, the other portion of Liberty, there we expect to develop another 17 BCF by 2013.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So it seems that there\u2019s a decent of both Bay Gas and Mississippi Hub that\u2019s uncontracted.  It strikes me a little different than maybe your prior strategies of rarely breaking ground on something until you\u2019ve got it more 50-60% contracted.", "Neal Schmale", "No.  I don\u2019t really think we\u2019ve changed the strategy much at all.  Remember that these caverns are developed a little bit at a time, and we contract as we go forward, so I think what you\u2019re seeing there is very consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the past.  They\u2019re not developed in big chunks at one time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Annie Tsao \u2013 Alliance Bernstein.", "Annie Tsao \u2013 Alliance Bernstein", "If you look at the commodity margin and if you look at the breakdown in the margin, you see a tremendous weakness mostly driven by power and gas in the quarter.  Is there anyway you can quantify how much is from demand and how much is really from the prices?", "Mark Snell", "Annie, there are a couple of things going on here.  First off, let\u2019s recognize that the year ago quarter was a record quarter, so it is much higher than what we would normally experience, but that said, it is absolutely true that we have probably some of the lowest gas prices and lowest power prices across the country that we\u2019ve had in a long time, and that\u2019s in sharp contrast to some of the highest prices we had a year ago, so that has taken the value of volatility really out of those markets.  The other thing too, and this isn\u2019t so evident by just looking at the outright prices, but I think for physical traders like us, we think of us as almost like logistics experts.  We make our business in the gas and power business by getting gas and power to end-users through a network of pipeline capacity, transmission, and things that we control or own, and we\u2019re kind of logistics experts.  Differentials across the country are about as low as they\u2019ve ever been.  California which traditionally trades at a steep discount to Henry Hub is actually even with Henry or jus few cents above, so all of those kinds of factors have led to this above, so all of those kinds of factors have led to the power and gas business being tough trading environment currently.  That won\u2019t last forever, and frankly it will probably change as we approach the fourth quarter.  I think we could see some difference there, and the market will return more back to normal, but right now it\u2019s a tough environment.  I think one of the things that\u2019s most important as look at our trading results is that we have a pretty diversified group now, and the good thing is that while we have been lower in gas and power, we have done exceptionally well in oil and in metals, and we continue to see those as strong businesses through the end of the year, so it\u2019s helped us balance our portfolio, and then I guess the last point is just again with the joint venture, because of the way the income sharing is, our shareholders are not really seeing the full impact of the volatility around the trading earnings any longer because as I said in prepared notes, if we make less money, we get a higher percentage of the income, and if we make more money, we get a lower percentage, and so I think you\u2019re going to continue to see fairly consistent trading results.", "Don Felsinger", "If you look at the last 48 quarters of earnings, we have had almost every quarter a different mix of some type of product and geographic diversity that has helped contribute to earnings, and as Mark said what we have going forward now is not only the product diversity and geographic diversity, as we now have a profit sharing plan with RBS Sempra Commodities that basically gives us a level of protection going forward.", "Annie Tsao \u2013 Alliance Bernstein", "Is there anything that benefits you from the stimulus package?", "Don Felsinger", "We\u2019re looking at some things in the utility that have haven\u2019t made a decision to go forward on, things like electric vehicles or that sort.  Debbie, anything you want to talk about in the stimulus package?", "Debbie Reed ", "I would make a couple of comments.  The things that we are looking at under the stimulus package are really all incremental to what we have in our plan, and so the rate base that we\u2019re investing, the smart meters and all, we\u2019re not going to go apply for stimulus dollars for those kinds of things, so what we are doing is using that platform as an opportunity to go for stimulus dollars to add on in areas like smart grid and tying in all of the electric vehicles to that smart grid, and then looking at some of the communication networks that will get us to the full usage of some of the things we\u2019re putting in with our smart meters which are the home area network, so all the stimulus that we are looking at would be really incremental to what we had in our plan.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mark Rogers with Gagnon Securities.", "Mark Rogers \u2013 Gagnon Securities", "", "My question is regarding the smart grid rollout.  Are you guys dual sourcing your smart meters and, if so, what was the split of the 50,000 meters shipped to date, and then I have a followup.", "", "Debbie Reed", "", "Our meters are being provided by Itron for the SDG&E project.  What I would say is that we put 50,000 in, we\u2019re expecting to put 200,000 to 300,000 by the end of this year.  It\u2019s going on really well.   On the SoCalGas side, we have a pending application before the CPUC, and we have not determined any of our vendors on that.", "", "Mark Rogers \u2013 Gagnon Securities", "The 50,000 meters that are installed to date, what are your customers seeing right now with respect to their usage changing?", "", "Debbie Reed", "", "The first meters that are going in, we have not started the smart meter billing yet.  That will happen in around September of this year.  What we are seeing though is we have done a lot of orientation meetings with customers before, and our customers are saying if they haven\u2019t received it when can we get this.  We\u2019re really interested in having the access to the information that would be provided by these meters, so there\u2019s been a great acceptance.  It\u2019s really gone extremely smoothly with our first 50,000.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Michael Bolt with Wells Fargo.", "Michael Bolt \u2013 Wells Fargo", "", "I was wondering if you could tell me what the total regulatory capital at the commodity JV was in Q2?", "", "Mark Snell", "", "It\u2019s a little over $2 billion.", "", "Michael Bolt \u2013 Wells Fargo", "", "Absent any big rebound in commodity prices, would the rest of the year be somewhere at that level to be reasonable?", "", "Mark Snell", "", "Yes, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that it would stay about that level.  You hit the nail right on the head.  The only thing that would change that is if we had a huge rebound in commodity prices.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Asher Khan with Incremental.", "Asher Khan \u2013 Incremental ", "Don, you mentioned even with the write-off, you are fine with the forecast.  Which segment is performing better than expectations?", "Don Felsinger", "It\u2019s basically our utilities.  They have a much higher margin than what we had over this time period last year.", "Asher Khan \u2013 Incremental ", "You expect based on what you provided at the analyst conference that the utilities are going to better than those numbers.  Is that what the year is telling you?", "Don Felsinger", "That is what I believe.  Debbie and I have a disagreement over this, but I think the utilities will do better than we had forecasted.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  The next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "On the cash balance that you guys have for the quarter of about $800 million, give us an idea of how that cash balance is going to move throughout the portion of the year and how that will be applied to the utility projects?", "Mark Snell", "", "Faisel, that $800 million, the vast majority of that is cash at SoCalGas, and the biggest thing is we are still injecting for the upcoming season, and the gas prices are just a lot cheaper than they were last year, so we are sitting on a little more cash than we are used to.", "", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "", "Could that be a permanent return of capital to you guys?", "", "Mark Snell", "", "Well, let\u2019s try to play out and see where that goes.  We have a lot of big capital projects at the utilities, and so it may delay from borrowing and some other things if it sticks around, but I think right now our cash flow plans are such that we won\u2019t be having big dividends coming back from the utilities yet.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "", "Just on the write-down, just trying to understand the after tax number, between the after tax and pretax amount, I think $64 million was the write-down after tax but $132 million pretax?", "Don Felsinger", "That\u2019s correct.  The pretax was for the entire project.", "Joseph Householder", "The 132 is 100% of the liberty.  We only own 75%, so really 99 of that is ours.  The 33 is added back down below on that line that says earnings losses attributable to non-controlling interest.  ", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "On the power link line, have you ordered all the major components for that line yet?  All the major capital equipment and materials been ordered?", "Don Felsinger", "I\u2019ll have Debbie give you an update of where we stand both with preconstruction activities and purchasing.", "Debbie Reed", "What we have done is we have looked locking in the long lead time equipment for that project.  We have a budget that\u2019s been approved by the CPCU of about $1.9 billion and to the extent that we have long lead time equipment that we can lock in and especially if we can lock it in that amounts less than what was budgeted.  We\u2019re moving forward with doing that.  We are doing our preconstruction activities which include the land acquisition, all the permitting, and then we are waiting for just the final permit or the final approval from the national forest service which we expect towards the end of this year, and we will begin full-out construction in the middle of next year.", "Faisel Khan", "One last question on your prepared remarks on the wildfire litigation, I got a little confused some of the numbers.  What\u2019s the net liability outside of the insurance claims and everything to Sempra?", "Don Felsinger", "I don\u2019t know if we have an exact number, but let me just say that we had some really positive developments this past quarter.  When we won, we\u2019re able to reach settlement with the insurance company for some of the homeowners for about $0.57 or $0.58 on the dollar, and we got the judge to deny class action status, so those are two good things.  The fact that we\u2019re able to settle with some of the insurance companies for a significant piece of the claim, we think going forward with the homeowners the $940 million reserve that we have at this time appears to be accurate with the information that we have.  Going forward with the remaining claims that are out there, the non-homeowners, and these would be like governmental entities, firefighters, others, we aren\u2019t able to determine an exact number, but when we look at the fact that we have additional insurance coverage that we will not expend, the fact that we have a claim against Cox Cable, and at the end of the process, if we end up needing to have additional recovery, we don\u2019t have insurance, we would apply to the commission for relief, so we feel pretty good about where we are at this point in time.  Obviously, this has several more years to play out, but we like where we are.", "Operator", "We have a followup question from the line of Mark Rogers with Gagnon Securities.", "Mark Rogers \u2013 Gagnon Securities ", "You are still at 2.3 million end-points for your total program, so that\u2019s roughly a million a year between 2010 and 2011, is that correct?", "Debbie Reed", "We would expect to be at about 200,000 to 300,000 installed this year and then do the rest of them over the next two years through 2011 at SDG&E, and then assuming approval by the CPUC for SoCalGas smart meters, that\u2019s 6 million endpoints for the gas side only, and we would begin installation of those meters around 2012 and complete those by about 2016.", "Mark Rogers \u2013 Gagnon Securities", "", "And the 2.3 million gas and electric, what\u2019s the split on gas and what\u2019s the spilt on electric for SDG&E.", "Debbie Reed", "It\u2019s 1.4 million for electric and about 900,000 for gas.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue.

On today\u2019s call I would like to accomplish several things. First review with you our 2009 financial results. I\u2019ll then discuss our sale to JPMorgan of a portion of our commodities business, and provide some additional color with respect to our next steps and then finally I\u2019ll give you an operational update of our utilities and infrastructure businesses. ", "Now the financial results, earlier this morning we reported fourth quarter earnings of $288 million or $1.16 per share compared with $319 million or $1.30 per share in the same period last year. For the full year 2009 earnings increased to $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share up from $1.1 billion or $4.43 per share. ", "Earnings per share for 2009 without the impact of a $0.26 per share write-off earlier this year improved 8% over last year\u2019s results. Last week when we announced the sale of a portion of the commodities joint venture we provided guidance for 2010 of $4.25 to $4.50 per share. This guidance assumes the sale of the metals, oil, and European energy business close by mid year and a full year earnings contribution from the commodity joint venture of $150 million to $250 million. ", "Now let me hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with slide four. ", "Mark Snell ", "Thanks Don, [inaudible] for gas and electric earnings for the fourth quarter were $67 million compared with earnings of $81 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $9 million of reduced incentive awards and $4 million of higher wildfire related insurance expense in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "Full year 2009 earnings increased to $344 million from $339 million in the previous year. At Southern California Gas fourth quarter 2009 earnings were $75 million, up from $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase was due to $10 million of higher margin and $7 million of lower litigation expense in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "For the full year 2009 SoCal earnings were $273 million up from $244 million in 2008. The 12% increase in earnings for the year was due to continued strong operating performance. Now let\u2019s go to slide five, Sempra Commodities earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $71 million compared to $164 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The last quarter of 2008 benefited from great performance across all of our product lines. ", "This year the business performed modestly in the fourth quarter of 2009, that was led by oil and metals. Power also performed well but results in the gas book were weak due to low volatility and a flat basis differential during the final quarter of the year. The quarter was also impacted by retention costs and higher foreign taxes within the joint venture. ", "For the full year 2009 commodity earnings of $345 million were in line with 2008 results. Now let\u2019s move to slide six. Here we show how income is allocated at the joint venture for the last quarter and for the full year of 2009, a couple of highlights.", "First the joint venture had income of $28 million during the quarter. After applying the income allocation methodology the distributable income to Sempra was $24 million. After adjusting to US GAAP and for the impact of taxes, Sempra\u2019s joint venture income for the quarter was $74 million, that\u2019s down from $162 million in the same quarter in 2008.", "For the year the joint venture had distributable income of $407 million and Sempra\u2019s after-tax share was $352 million. The US GAAP conversion adjustment of $55 million for the quarter and $163 million for the year was primarily the recognition of storage and transportation earnings from 2008 that could not be recognized under US GAAP until 2009.", "Now let\u2019s move to slide seven, fourth quarter earnings for our generation business were $43 million compared with $60 million in the same quarter in 2008. The decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of $16 million of Mexican income tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009 the generation business recorded earnings of $162 million compared to $222 million in the prior year. ", "The decrease was due to $31 million in reduced earnings due to lower gas prices in 2009, the Mexican tax benefit in 2008 that I just mentioned, and $9 million of solar investment tax credit in 2008. Now let\u2019s move to slide eight. ", "Sempra pipelines and storage recorded earnings of $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, that\u2019s up from earnings of $22 million in the same quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 results include $5 million of higher earnings from natural gas operations in Mexico, $5 million of higher earnings from investments in South America, and $2 million of higher earnings from domestic pipeline and storage assets. ", "For the full year 2009 earnings were $101 million compared to $106 million in 2008. The decrease was due a $64 million write-off related to the Liberty Gas storage project. The write-off was largely offset by $29 million in higher earnings from North American operations, $13 million of favorable tax benefits in 2009, compared with $9 million of unfavorable tax adjustments in 2008, and $8 million of higher earnings from South American investments during 2009.", "Now please turn to slide nine, this slide provides a summary of our business unit results. I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of things here, Sempra LNG had earnings of $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with a loss of $13 million in the prior year\u2019s period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to the start up of marketing and terminal operations. ", "I\u2019d point out that the fourth quarter of 2009 was the first full quarter that we received revenue from all of our long-term contracts. For the full year 2009 Sempra LNG recorded earnings of $16 million compared with a loss of $46 million in 2008. For 2010 we expect annual earnings to be in the range of $70 to $90 million. ", "At parent and other we recorded a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $49 million in the same quarter in 2008. For the full year 2009 the parent recorded a loss of $122 million compared to a loss of $97 million in 2008. This increase is primarily due to increased interest expense. ", "Please turn to slide 10, overall our results for the quarter and for the year were very strong. Earnings at our California utilities were up a combined 6% for the full year, operating cash flow during 2009 was up 57% over the prior year, and from a liquidity perspective we still have $3.6 billion of availability under our committed bank lines at the end of the year.", "And with that I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Don who will begin with slide 11.", "Don Felsinger ", "Thanks Mark, now let me update you on our business activities starting with our commodities joint venture, last week we and RBS announced an agreement to sell the metals, oil, and European energy segments of RBS Sempra commodities to JPMorgan for an expected $1.7 billion. Sempra\u2019s share of the proceeds is expected to be $941 million. We also expect to distribute approximately $500 million of excess cash in the business of which Sempra would receive half. ", "Please go to slide 12, last week I commented that we were still exploring options related to the remaining North American Gas and Power business. These options included [inaudible] business or finding a new partner or other relationship to provide liquidity and financial support that would cap our exposure to the business and allow us to reacquire RBS\u2019s share without issuing equity. ", "We have continued to explore several options for a third party support but in this market we no longer believe we can find a cost effective long-term alternative to equity. Because of this a sale of the business is now our preferred outcome. We have several interested parties and believe a transaction can be completed quickly and in a fashion that delivers the best result for our shareholders.", "Please go to the next slide, in a sale we anticipate receiving 49% of the remaining book value which equates to approximately $800 million plus a premium. This assumes all the previously discussed distributions have been made.

What do you think it takes to close that gap. ", "Don Felsinger ", "Well I think the steps we\u2019re taking right now are going to do that. This was a decision that we had a lot of agonizing over but as we went through the options of staying in the commodities business or selling it and looking at the growth options before us it became pretty clear the best outcome for our shareholders was to go ahead, sell this business and reinvest into businesses that have higher growth potential and hopefully a higher earnings multiple.

We do have effectively A ratings at all of our utilities and we don\u2019t want to have the parent be too far separated from those and the rating side. But I think the flexibility that we\u2019re going to get by moving away from the trading business is our business profile that the rating agencies look at is much more secure.

We have just found that many of the larger deals that we look at because of the premium required and when they\u2019re utility deals and the sharing you have to do back with customers, they just don\u2019t look out for our shareholders.

Now you new guidance for 2011 which is going to have no earnings in the business, no earnings from the commodities business actually we\u2019re seeing upward trajectory in earnings from 2010 to 2011. I\u2019m trying to reconcile that in my head does that mean that maybe 2010 was conservative and including when you included commodities you were trying to be extra conservative or is there just this big share buyback that\u2019s creating accretion even though you\u2019re selling another half of the business when the first half was dilutive, something is numerically is difficult to reconcile. ", "Mark Snell ", "Its not really that difficult, I think at the end of the day its fairly, it\u2019s a matter of timing. We have two things going on, one the 2010 guidance adjusts for the fact that we have a very much reduced commodities expectation in that number and we\u2019re getting the monies or the proceeds from the sales towards the middle to the end of the year. And with 2011 we can redeploy those proceeds and some of them which will give instant earnings accretion which is like for instance the share buyback. ", "And we\u2019ll have some new investments coming on line, like our Mexican pipeline assets and then also just reflective of the fact that our other businesses have fairly good growth. Our utilities are going to grow our other businesses are going to grow and so that\u2019s all reflected in the 2011 guidance. So I think from a, one of the things that we\u2019re showing here is yes, we are kind of resetting the bar where we\u2019re going from a move forward position, but we\u2019re absolutely going to grow this business robustly into the future and this is where, and this is the direction its going to be and its going to be growth in things that I think our shareholders are going to appreciate, give a higher multiple to and we think it will be a better stock.

I think even in the last 24 hours there was some news flow about bond issuances. At what point do we think about California potentially as a regulatory environment for utilities mean reverting. It was not 10 years ago where people would have looked maybe its 11 or 12 years ago that people would have looked at California and said, it was the worst in the country. Its probably spent the last five or seven years as the very best in the country. Is what\u2019s happening in California as a state financially or economically the driver that over the next couple of years maybe not sends it right back down to number 50 but mean reverts it back from being kind of the best regulatory environment in the nation.

And customers have kind of swung up and down depending on the price of oil and natural gas because of that. California adopted a policy about four or five years ago to go its own way and to become less dependent upon fossil fuels and to have a higher build out of renewables along with energy efficiency and demand side management.", "And that direction had support not just from the regulators at the commission but also from the elected officials in Sacramento. And even today with, there\u2019s no doubt that we have a tough economic climate in California, when you look at the fact that the one thing that we\u2019re blessed with in California is fairly decent weather and we don't have a large base of industrial customers. This has not been an issue.

Let me just stop there and have Debbie\u2014", "Debbie Reed ", "I don\u2019t have much to add to that, I would say that we have some of the lowest bills in the US and to emphasize that and that\u2019s because California has invested so much in energy efficiency to reduce customer bills. And that is a bipartisan leadership position of our state that from the Governor to the legislature to the commission and the regulatory agencies there is true alignment of where the state sees the future in this area.", "As a matter of fact there was just recently a discussion at a commission meeting on this issue and the discussion was around the need of the commission to provide the stability in regulation to ensure that these long-term investments can be made to create that future that they envision and I think the most recent example of that is we just got the decision from the assigned commissioner on Smart Meter for SoCalGas which reinforces, this is a $1.1 billion project and the assigned commissioner is proposing approval of that. ", "And so I think that\u2019s an example that our commission is really focused on achieving this long-term vision of infrastructure, development and stability for customers. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "One follow-up question, unrelated business, when you\u2019re looking down at the Gulf and looking at post the acquisition of energy south, about how many storage caverns you anticipate building over the next few years, both at Bay Gas and Mississippi hub, has that changed since your prior outlook given what\u2019s happened just to electricity demand down there. ", "", "Don Felsinger ", "I\u2019m going to have Neal give you a perspective but I would just say that you have to come back to the way that we develop and contract these facilities. We don\u2019t build any of these things unless there\u2019s a customer requirement or demand or sign up for storage capacity. And so we\u2019ve always approached this business that yes gas prices will be volatile, and they\u2019ll be less volatile but what really counts here as we look at building these projects in good locations is whether or not we can get customers to sign up to use these facilities and that will always be the direction we go forward with our development program in the Gulf. ", "Neal Schmale ", "Short answer is we\u2019re still on the same trajectory that we\u2019ve communicated earlier. We have a little bit over 11 BCF of capacity that\u2019s fully contracted and operational and we\u2019re going to increase that by about 12.5 by year end and a significant portion of that is contracted as well. So I just would underline what Don said which is that our fundamental approach to these kinds of businesses is to contract a significant portion of the capacity before we commit to the construction. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Leon Dubov - Catapult Capital", "Leon Dubov - Catapult Capital", "I realize this is kind of a fairly unlikely scenario but maybe you could kind of humor me, if for some reason that there is not enough interest in the North American business what are you fall back plans if you can\u2019t sell it. Would you prefer to just wind it down or would you then look at owing the whole thing in some kind of scaled down version. ", "Don Felsinger ", "First of all let\u2019s go with the premise that RBS is going to get out of this business period and so with that there will be an exit that is planned. Its hard for me to see how we would stay in this business just looking at the amount of robust interest that\u2019s already been expressed in buying the remaining parts. ", "Mark Snell ", "I would say that I think the premise is actually it is quite remote but if it were to be the case and alternative you could wind down the business and I don't think we would have any problem getting our book value out of it at the kind of a worse case scenario so I think from that perspective it\u2019s a relatively low risk kind of perspective and one of the reasons I [inaudible] a lot of comfort in that is as we have discussed previously the North American Gas and Power business right now because of a relatively flat basis across the country, and with the [contangos] that have come in lately I think you find that we don\u2019t have as large a net investment in that business as we\u2019ve had in the past.", "And so we\u2019re sitting on a fair amount of cash and we\u2019ve talked about some distributions already and there\u2019s still a cushion in the business so I don\u2019t think it would be a tough thing to do but I think generally speaking we think that\u2019s a very very remote outcome and it just makes so much sense for so many different parties to step into this thing at this time that I just don\u2019t I just really don\u2019t think its going to happen. ", "Leon Dubov - Catapult Capital", "What kind of timeframe do you think we\u2019d be looking at in this continued unlikely case of a wind down to get the book value out so sort of similar worst case outcome to a sale but in a different format. ", "Mark Snell ", "I think like I said most of the money is already in cash and so the remaining amount which would only be less than $500 million is the average book life is 18 months, so you would roll off in roughly that period. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jessi Loudon \u2013 Zimmer Lucas ", "Jessi Loudon \u2013 Zimmer Lucas ", "Just had a quick question regarding some of the proceeds just in terms on the exit from the business but just with respect to the earnings, I know you earned about $345 million this year. As I understand it you usually get the dividends next year, and you\u2019re projecting in your 2010 guidance of about $200 million, so how should we think of that extra $500 million of earnings, is that included in the proceeds or would it be incremental. ", "Mark Snell ", "That is the, the extra $200 million is not included, last year\u2019s earnings is included in the proceeds. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of an Unspecified Analyst", "", "Unspecified Analyst", "I just wanted one clarification on your comments regarding the target rating, now obviously if you sell this business you can\u2019t keep the BBB positive rating at the rating agencies I would think, but in terms of your targeted rating are you still looking at BBB flat or better or now that you\u2019re not going to get the commodity business you\u2019re looking at BBB positive and would like to stay there. ", "Mark Snell  ", "I think we\u2019ll always be BBB flat or better, and even with the commodities business, we consider that where we\u2019d be. We\u2019re BBB plus right now, we think that this, that for the most part the rating agencies will keep us at that, we don\u2019t expect a change even with these plans. ", "Unspecified Analyst", "I would think so but in terms of your targeting, are you targeting BBB positive now. ", "Mark Snell ", "We\u2019re targeting, we would not go below BBB flat, we\u2019re targeting BBB positive. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rudy Tolentino \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Rudy Tolentino \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Looking out to 2012 should we expect 2012 earnings to be flat given the roll off of the CDWR contracts net any new growth investments. ", "Don Felsinger ", "We\u2019re going to save something for the analyst call, we\u2019ve given way more information than we normally give at this point in our planning cycle and so we\u2019re really not going to address 2012 or other future years until you come and see us in April.", "Rudy Tolentino \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "But can you just maybe give me a sense of what your plans for hedging your gas generation assets going forward on the CDWR contracts expire or is that, I\u2019ll let you give a shot a that. ", "", "Mark Snell ", "I think what we\u2019re looking at to do is obviously to try to maximize the revenue potential of those assets. We\u2019re looking at a lot of different ways to recognize that potential. And obviously there will be some degradation in income in that business unit but we think we have other business units that are going to do much much better. So generally speaking we\u2019ll be fine. ", "Rudy Tolentino \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "But is this something that you are looking to, are you thinking about like selling the\u2014", "Mark Snell ", "No I think generally speaking we\u2019re going to continue to operate those assets. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Alley - Decade Capital", "John Alley - Decade Capital", "I was just wondering if you could clarify something for me, I heard earlier you were saying you\u2019re targeting a 50/50 capital structure is that right. ", "Don Felsinger ", "That\u2019s what we have now and with those capital programs we have underway its what we are going to try to maintain. ", "John Alley - Decade Capital", "Okay because in the past you said if trading weren\u2019t really an issue you\u2019d look to take it to more 40% or 60/40. ", "Mark Snell ", "That\u2019s probably something that I had said in the past and let me just be clear, what I said was was that our non-utility businesses could support a little, probably could have a little bit higher leverage but our utilities businesses which are vast majority of our balance sheet are a 50/50 capital structure or even a little less leverage. And so when you average the two, we still kind of come out around 50/50 and to be honest, we don\u2019t, we frankly don\u2019t manage to a capital structure from that perspective. ", "We manage to a coverage ratio and when we are in a growth mode as we are currently in and building projects ahead of their cash flow we tend to have to manage to a slightly better leverage, less leverage just to maintain our coverage ratios. And that\u2019s really where we operate. ", "Now with that I will say the fact that we\u2019re selling the commodity business gives us a little more flexibility in our coverage ratios because our earnings are now a lot more predictable and a lot more certain, we don\u2019t need as high a coverage ratio as we have in the past but even with revised ratios we\u2019ll still be around 50/50 coverage, that\u2019s the way it will work it. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Mike Bolt \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Mike Bolt \u2013 Wells Fargo", "In terms of the 2011 guidance if you do get a premium on the North American commodities business does that represent maybe some potential upside to the 465 high end or is it included in there. ", "Mark Snell ", "Its not included, it would be a little bit of upside depending on how we were able to deploy the proceeds. ", "Operator", "There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. ", "Don Felsinger ", "Thanks again to all of you for taking time this afternoon to join us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Any follow on questions, get a hold of Jeff or Scott. Have a great day and we\u2019ll see you on March 25 in sunny San Diego, take care. ", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steve Davis", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's first quarter 2010 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debby Reed, Executive Vice President and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You'll note that slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement.

It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. With that, I'll turn it over to Don, who will begin with slide 3.", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks. And again, thank you all for joining us. On today's call, I would like to accomplish several things. First review with you our first quarter financial results, then give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure businesses. Before I get into our financial results, I would like to spend a moment on the litigation settlement we announced last week.", "I realize that some of you may have been surprised by this but I strongly believe the settlement was the best solution to put to rest litigation that has gone on for nearly a decade and could have continued for years to come. I'll discuss the settlement in more detail later in the call.", "Now to the financial results. Earlier this morning we reported first quarter earnings of $106 million, or $0.42 per share, compared with $316 million, or $1.29 per share in the same period last year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to $ 96 million or $0.38 per share impact of the litigation settlement and reduced results from the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. Earnings, excluding the settlement amount were $202 million or $0.81 per share. Due to the impact of the litigation settlements and assuming break-even performance at RBS Sempra Commodities, we now expect earnings of $3.15 to $3.40 per share in 2010.", "Now, let me hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with slide 4.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Don. At San Diego gas and electric, earnings for the first quarter were $83 million, compared with earnings of $99 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $5 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums and a $3 million charge due to the elimination of a tax benefit that was associated with the recent passage of the healthcare bill.", "The first quarter of 2009 benefited $5 million from the favorable resolution of a litigation matter. During the first quarter, STG&E recorded a $107 million regulatory asset relating to reserves for wildfire claims that exceeded our $1.1 billion of insurance. We believe that STG&E will ultimately recover substantially all wildfire costs in excess of its insurance limits.", "There are codefendants in the litigation and other responsible parties that STG&E has a claim against. In addition, based on our regulatory experience, we believe STG&E will be able to recover substantially all wildfire related costs that exceed our coverage and are not recovered from other responsible parties.", "At Southern California gas, first quarter 2010 earnings were $65 million, up from $59 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase was due to $9 million of higher margin, $3 million of higher regulatory awards and $2 million of lower bad debt expense. These benefits were offset by a $13 million charge due to the passage of the healthcare bill.", "Now let's go to slide 5. Our generation business recorded a loss of $53 million in the first quarter, compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter in 2009. The decrease for the quarter is primarily the result of an $84 million charge related to the energy crisis litigation settlement. The quarter was also impacted by $12 million of lower earnings from operations, primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance and associated downtime.", "Now, please move to slide 6. Sempra pipeline and storage recorded earnings of $38 million in the first quarter of 2010, up from earnings of $37 million in the same quarter of 2009. The quarter benefited from $6 million of higher earnings from foreign currency exchange rate effects, offset by $4 million of lower earnings from its storage operations.", "Now turn to slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $32 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with a loss of $7 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to the start up of marketing and terminal operations. We also benefited in the quarter from $11 million of payments related to non delivery of cargoes and from $7 million of mark to market earnings.", "Let's move to slide 8. Sempra Commodities recorded a loss of $5 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to earnings of $114 million in the last year's first quarter. The loss was due primarily to reduced margins in oil in European natural gas marketing, as well as higher costs for employer retention and a $12 million charge related to the energy crisis litigation settlement. Just in the last few days, we received $197 million cash distribution from the joint venture related to 2009 earnings. This distribution will be reflected in our second quarter results.", "Now let's move to slide 9. This slide provides a summary of our business unit results. I would like to highlight our results at Parent & Other where we recorded a loss of $54 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $29 million in the same quarter in 2009. The increase in loss is primarily due to the impact of $17 million of higher Mexican taxes. The quarter was also impacted by a higher consolidated tax adjustment and additional interest expense.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who will begin with slide 10.", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks, Mark. Before I get into an update on our business activities, I want to provide some additional color on the energy crisis litigation settlement we announced last week. The $410 million settlement ends two main pieces of litigation, each of which is funded separately.", "$260 million will be funded from RBS Sempra Commodities and $150 million from Sempra Energy and Sempra Generation. The after tax cash effect to Sempra is $96 million. This settlement ends the FERC refund proceeding. As many of you may recall, this proceeding relates to the FERC's formulaic adjustment of market prices for short term energy sales in the years 2000 and 2001.", "The settlement also ends the litigation related to Sempra Generation's contract with the California department of water resources. Although we have successfully defended this contract numerous times, this settlement will put an end to the continued litigation, appeals, and arbitrations.", "As many of you know, we've been dealing with energy price litigation for nearly a decade. This settlement gives us the opportunity to put to an end this litigation which could have continued for many more years and had unforeseen risk. We can now move to a more constructive relationship with all of the California parties.", "And, with that, I'll have you go to slide 11. Let me now update you on the activities at our California utilities. We still expect the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line to be in service in the second half of 2012. We're awaiting the final approval from the U.S. forest service which is expected to this quarter. Procurement and (inaudible) work still continue. We have now locked in half of the material and roughly 80% of the construction costs.", "Turning to our Smart-Meter Programs, at STG&E, we have now installed more than 800,000 meters and we expect to have all 2.3 million gas and electric meters installed by year end 2011. At SoCalGas, in April, our $900 million gas smart meter project was approved. We will be installing 6 million smart gas meters in phases from 2012 to 2017.", "The CPUC approved our $900 million gas Smart-Meter project and we will be installing in 6 million gas smart-meters in phases from 2012 to year end 2017. At San Diego Gas & Electric and SoCalGas, we will be filing our applications for both utilities 2012, general rate cases in the second half of this year. The CPUC rate case plan calls for decision by year-end 2011.", "Now please go to slide 12. At Sempra Generation, we've began construction on our Copper Mountain solar project in Boulder City, Nevada. This project is a 47 megawatt expansion of existing 10 megawatt El Dorado solar facility. The power generated by this expansion will be sold under a 20 year contract to PG&E. We'll bring the project online in phases and expect to complete construction by the end of this year or at the very latest, very early in 2011.", "Moving to our LNG business unit, we have recently announced a supply agreement with Gazprom. Under this multiyear agreement, Gazprom will play Sempra LNG for the right to deliver up to two LNG cargoes per month at the Cameron LNG terminal at a predetermined price formula. This agreement will commence in June of this year.", "This agreement, along with our previously announced RasGas arrangement will utilize available capacity at our Cameron LNG terminal. These two agreements are in addition to our 20 year contracts that account for nearly 65% of our combined LNG total capacity.", "At our pipelines and storage business, we have now closed on our acquisition of El Paso's pipeline and gas infrastructure assets for $300 million, or $260 million net of cash and debt. The acquisition includes a natural gas pipeline and compression assets in the Mexican state of Sonora and a 50% interest in a joint venture with PMEX, a Mexican state-owned oil company. The joint venture operates two natural gas pipelines and a propane system in Northern Mexico.", "PMEX has filed a plan with the Mexican government to dispose of their 50% ownership in the joint venture. Any sale is subject to our right of first refusal. PMEX's long term contracts to utilize the pipelines capacity will remain unchanged. The assets are all in operation and provide stable revenue streams under long term contracts, representing a weighted average length of 13 years with PMEX and the Mexican federal electricity company.", "In early April, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the Mexicali region of Northern Baja, Mexico. Our pipeline, LNG and power plants located in that area did not suffer any major damage. Our Mexicali power plant has been out of service since that time, waiting for replacement parts for some relatively inexpensive, but critical equipment that was damaged during the quake. We expect the plant to be back in service later this month.", "Before we move on, I would like to update you on the progress of our sales process at RBS Sempra Commodities. We are moving forward in obtaining the necessary approvals for the sale of our metals, oil, and European energy segments to JPMorgan. We anticipate the closing of this estimated $1.7 billion transaction early in the second half of this year. The closing was delayed several weeks because of the inability to schedule meetings with European Union regulatory officials due to a volcanic ash situation that impacted travel and business throughout Europe.", "Negotiations for the sale of our North American Power and Gas segments are moving forward as well. We have narrowed the list of successful bidders through a second round of offers and expect to announce a buyer within the next four to six weeks. Our assumption of break even earnings for the joint venture, prior to a sale has not changed our expectations that total proceeds to Sempra Energy from both transactions will be approximately $2 billion.", "Now please go to the next slide. While the results for the quarter at our Commodities joint venture were disappointing, our core utility and infrastructure businesses continue to perform well. This year, we have settled major litigation and reduced risk to our shareholders. We're moving forward with major projects at the utilities. Our recent approval of the SoCalGas Smart-Meter program and the progress we've made for the construction of Sunrise Powerlink are very positive.", "At our infrastructure businesses, we're focused on the continued development of our storage and solar projects and we're making progress with the completion of the sale transaction RBS Sempra Commodities. The proceeds from those transactions will help fund our robust capital program, facilitate our expected share repurchase program and lead to strong predictable growth.", "With that, let me stop now and take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Good afternoon.", "Don Felsinger", "Hey Faisel, how are you?", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, how are you doing? On the joint venture, I just want to understand, the premium \u2013 the sale to JPMorgan is based on a fixed premium, based on the book value of the assets and so I guess with the loss that you guys incurred, specifically in the crude line, I guess it's only $13 million but is there any significant sort of impairment to that book value?", "Don Felsinger", "No, there is not. Let me ask Mark if he could maybe spend just a few minutes on the sales process in general.", "Mark Snell", "Well, Faisel, you're absolutely correct in that, that it is a fixed premium to book value and we did have some small losses on those businesses. But they really didn't impact \u2013 they were really minor impacts on the book value and it really doesn't change our expectation of proceeds.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Great. And then just on the different product lines, it looks like except for crude oil, everything else did okay. Was there anything in particular in the crude business that didn't go well for you in the quarter?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, we just didn't make as much money as we had expected. There's nothing that \u2013 there was no major blowout or big problems. We just didn't see some of the opportunities that we had anticipated and we had some dropping prices during that period. But I think generally speaking, the rest of the business performed okay. But we also coupled it with the charge from the litigation and also with some higher retention and employee compensation costs that we instituted at the end of the quarter and those things affected the earnings negatively.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, I have just one more question and I'll get back in the queue. Specifically on the healthcare costs at Sempra Utilities, both at STG&E and SoCalGas, it looks like some of the costs were in the tax line and some of them were in the operating line and they seem to be different between SoCalGas and STG&E. I was hoping you could help us reconcile what's going on with what appears to be a one-time hit to expenses.", "Don Felsinger", "I believe they were all tax. Let me have Mark to validate that.", "Mark Snell", "No, that's right. They all affected the tax line, both of them. It basically is a tax benefit that most companies had recorded that was eliminated as part of this package and, it affected us as it did just about everybody else.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. And it's just a onetime item. Is that correct?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, it is, correct.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks, Faisel.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.", "Don Felsinger", "Hey, Craig.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Hi, thanks for the call. So, Don is the final sale of the U.S. portion of the JV being impacted at all by turmoil in the financial players or proposed restrictions on their activities?", "Don Felsinger", "Craig, no, it's not. As a matter of fact, we are in the second round of activity now with selling the second half and Mark was telling me this morning that we expect to open up those bids for the second round sometime either late this week or early next week.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Great. And Mark, I was a little confused about the comments about the wildfire insurance. When I heard the word higher premiums I thought, well you guys had to tap that insurance and they raised their rates on you going forward. But then what I heard in your discussion was that there are some costs that you expect to recoup later on for past issues. I'm just trying to get a sense for what kind of ongoing expense that might be and if you think all of it, including higher ongoing premiums would be recouped?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, we do have a filing that we have before the regulatory agency in California to recapture the higher premiums that we have been paying since the wildfire. Do you want to take this Mark?", "Mark Snell", "Yeah, sure. As Don said, we do have a filing. We expect to do that, but we don't know what the outcome of that is going to be. So we expensed the higher premiums currently. And then in my comments, I also commented on some settlements related actually to the fires that we had and those settlements now exceed some of our insurance coverage and therefore we have recorded a regulatory asset for that. We do expect over the long term to collect all of that money from either responsible third parties first or through our normal tariffs.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Great. And last question, I don't know if you all could comment a little about the market for gas storage. I think we have heard from another Sea Corp that has a good growing gas storage business that there's still opportunities for maybe $0.20 per Mcf month of contracting and there was recently, \u2013 I know you don't need any cash but there was recently a very attractively priced MLP IPO in the (inaudible) gas storage space. I just wonder if you can comment about, is the market for contracting storage looking any better? How does it look in terms of how assets are being valued, in terms of just physical assets and down the road, even if you don't need the money, if there's such a wide disparity in evaluation of this part of the business, would you consider some other type of place for them to reside?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, I think your comments tend to capture the whole realm of opportunities that are out there. Everybody I think by now is seeing the recent transaction and valuation around the Pine Prairie and the Bluewater assets that at one time I think we owned and sold. But as we stand in the storage business right now, we have about 11.5 B's [ph] of operational storage that's been fully contracted and by the end of this year we will have another 12.5 Billion's [ph] that will go into service and we've already sold four, about 60% of that. So we are able to access the market, get customers to pay for the storage and so our opportunities are to develop and sell this forward. And at some point in time, if we're satisfied that the real opportunity is in transacting around these facilities, we'd also look at that.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "And are you seeing a healthy market for continuing to contract forward? There were some comments at the analyst day, a month-plus ago, that the market was a little weaker but starting to perhaps, recover?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, it is still fairly weak. You look at the natural gas market in general, prices are pretty low, volatility is flat. But as we continue to talk to customers, the long-term desirability of having the ability to store natural gas is something that customers are still willing to contract for. We're not seeing the prices that we saw two or three years ago, but they're robust enough to give us comfort we can go ahead and develop.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Great. Thank you.", "Don Felsinger", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. Let's see. Can you give us a little more clarity on the Gazprom contract? You said that Gazprom is contracted to pay Sempra LNG. Is this a monthly fee? Is it like a terminal use agreement?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, good afternoon Lasan. We have been talking for probably the last six months or a year about the opportunities to do something with unsold capacity that exists at Cameron. And that started out with doing a transaction with RasGas for them to bring in spot cargoes. And we have a similar arrangement, although a little bit different in the way that it's structured for Gazprom for them to be willing to pay to use our facility for a number of years to bring in cargoes.", "I can't get into the details for commercial reasons but I think it bodes well from a couple of standpoints. One is, there's a lot of unsold LNG capacity in the Gulf, and the fact that we have two major players that want to transact with us, I think it says something about Sempra and it says something about the location of our facility. So I think these are all positive developments. I'm sorry I can't give you more details around the financial arrangements.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Can you at least tell me if it's a predictable stream of cash flow or is it an intermittent stream of cash flow?", "Don Felsinger", "We will be getting basically a payment to use our facilities that will happen over time and then the opportunities as cargoes come in to make more money.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I see. On the healthcare charge, in response to Faisel's question, it's a one-time charge. Are there any ongoing recurring cost increases that you expect?", "Don Felsinger", "That's it, a onetime charge.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That's good. And then lastly, do you know if and when you would perhaps take a look at the PMEX piece of the Mexican assets?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, it's hard for me to speak for PMEX. They have a requirement, as I understand it by the Mexican competition commission to dispose of their assets. My general understanding is they're going to do that by the end of this year but it's hard to predict their timing. At a point in time when they do transact, because of our right of first refusal, we'll definitely take a hard look at it.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "One last question. Cargoes of LNG have been flowing very vigorously to the UK and the prices over there are really high. Does that change your thinking on the global oversupply that's currently in place?", "Don Felsinger", "I missed the last part of your question, Lasan.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Oh. The UK has been importing a lot more LNG than would have been originally expected several months ago and it sounds like the global oversupply is kind of being soaked up by the Europeans. Does this change the way you view the flow of LNG in the world or is this just a temporary phenomenon in Europe?", "Don Felsinger", "As a matter of fact, this is kind of what we expect is going to happen, that LNG will flow to the market that pays the highest price for it and I think we're on the very early stages of seeing a global natural gas market where it will flow freely to the location that has the highest price.", "Lasan Johong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks Lasan.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "Good morning, guys.", "Don Felsinger", "Hi, Paul, how are you?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "All right. The Sempra generation scheduled maintenance, is that a sort of one-timer? Could you just elaborate a little more on how that might be throughout the year?", "Don Felsinger", "Each of our power plants \u2013 I think it's around every three years \u2013 goes through a major shut down for anywhere from a 40 to 60 day period where we tear everything apart and take a look at it. EDM was returning last month from one of these major overhauls and had just come up and was operating possibly less than a day when the earthquake hit and the earthquake had so much ground shaking that some ceramic insulators on top of one of the transformers cracked and that's the inexpensive but critical piece of equipment we're now in a process of fabricating.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "Okay, and then with the LNG mark-to-market, does that reverse the $7 million LNG?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, that's actually a reversal of earlier losses. So it is the reverse of something that happened several months ago.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "Okay, great. And then just, I'm sorry if missed it, because there have been a few things going on, but it would seem to me that there should be no change in your 2011 and beyond outlook that you guys gave us just recently because the RBS JV was going to be gone anyway. So look if there's any impact from our understanding in terms of what your sales expectation would be. So is it safe to assume that things probably haven't changed much with respect to the forward outlook.", "Don Felsinger", "The only changes that we are making are for the year of 2010.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "Okay. And then was the last time that this business had a break even? I'm just sort of curious. Do you guys know?", "Mark Snell", "We had a loss quarter. It was about a year and a half ago.", "Don Felsinger", "But we have a long history of profitable quarters and this was one of only two or three that we've actually broke even or lost money.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "Okay. And could you elaborate a little bit more about the change in Parent & Other?", "Don Felsinger", "Sure. It's primarily from increased interest cost because as we bring things online, we're no longer capitalizing interest and maybe I'll ask Joe if he can elaborate on any of the other pieces.", "Joe Householder", "Sure. There are two other pieces. The Mexican taxes are affected by the exchange rate between the dollar and the Mexican peso and last year we had a benefit there. This year we actually had a detriment of 10. So there was a $17 million swing. And then, the effective tax rate caused us to have about a $13 million negative hit this quarter which will turn around over the course of the rest of the year. Don't know which quarter exactly it will turn around but that $13 million negative in the quarter will turn around by year-end.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "And from Goldman Sachs we'll go next to Michael Lapides.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys. Quick question on Sempra Generation. Can you talk; your K disclosed roughly 400 megawatt to 500 megawatt solar opportunity at one of the sites. But can you talk three wide [ph] how many megawatts of potential leveraged [ph] within the next three or four years or beyond that. I'm just trying to understand the real estate availability of potential solar megawatt additions at your existing gas sites or other lands that Sempra generation controls.", "Don Felsinger", "We have got 58 megawatts, 10 of which is in operation, and 48 being developed in Nevada around an existing site. And in some around Mesquite with the land position we have there, depending on what technology we use, we're thinking about 600 megawatts of photovoltaic. And then we have other land positions in Mexico that are primarily being held for wind development and we have some other wind projects that we're pursuing around the country. But around our existing sites, I would look at the 600 megawatts in Arizona and the 50 megawatts that we're building in Nevada as the primary opportunities.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And when we look at \u2013 what happens to the land that is around the El Dorado or El Dorado plant that's being sold back into STG&E? Does Sempra Gen control any additional land that\u2019s around that facility or does the land et cetera outside the fence, inside the fence, whatever, go to the utility?", "Don Felsinger", "The utility is buying a power plant and the footprint on which the power plant sits and the land around that belongs to Sempra Generation.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And is there room there for Sempra Generation to continue doing above and beyond the \u2013", "Don Felsinger", "That's correct.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Don Felsinger", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Vedula Murti with CDP US.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "Good afternoon.", "Don Felsinger", "Hi, Vedula.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "Two things. One you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the distribution coming here that will be recognized in the second quarter and you alluded to that there would be an earnings affect breaking on to 198 or approximately that number. So can you just kind of explain how that would then translate between what sounds like as a gross cash flow number and how that translates to net income?", "Don Felsinger", "I'm going to have Mark address this. I think that I may have confused you.", "Mark Snell", "No, I think you may have misunderstood. All I was saying was is that there was an expectation of getting our distribution by this call and we did get it just prior to the call, $196 million. But it's a cash flow only item. It doesn't have any effect on earnings.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "Okay. And secondarily, when you talked about to the $2 billion, is it correct for me to be thinking that that implies on the North American piece here that would be talking about at book value but that \u2013 at least I think in the past you've alluded to some possibility or probability of being able to achieve above book value. Can you kind of comment a little bit on that?", "Mark Snell", "Yeah, our expectation and what we've been signaling is about tangible book but there is a possibility for us to get more than that. Especially on parts of the business, we're seeing some pretty robust bids. But we really can't say anything until we actually announce something.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "And now that you're in second round or in that type of thing, I know you have allowed to, I think close by the end of the year, if I'm not mistaken. Given where you are do you feel like by the end of the second quarter, by the time we have the second quarter call or something like that, an announcement will have been made or can you just elaborate a little bit about, given where you know where you're at, at what point do you feel like you'll be able to tell us what the conclusion is?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, Vedula, when we started this process and at the analyst conference, we have made the assumption that we would probably be in this business through year-end. Based upon the progress we've made with JPMorgan and the progress we're making in selling the second half, we are fairly comfortable now \u2013 and it's hard to control the timing \u2013 that we'll be out of this early in the second half of this year.", "When I say early, my expectation is by July or August we'll be out of this business. Now, I don't control that schedule. There are a lot of parties involved but we're working as hard as we can so that by the time we have this next call, we'll either be out or be close to being out. That will be in the July-August time frame.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "So just to make sure I'm clear, when you're out, that means announced and completely closed and all the checks have crossed each other and that type of thing?", "Don Felsinger", "That's correct.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "Okay. And I guess one last thing is do you have the authorizations in place, in term of flexibility for stock buybacks and that type of thing or is that something that you would want to take to the board and have that authorized at the conclusion of this process?", "Don Felsinger", "The board has already given us authorization to move forward with stock buyback.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US", "Okay. Thank you.", "Don Felsinger", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Becca Followill from Tudor Pickering Holt.", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Hi, guys, two quick ones.", "Don Felsinger", "Hey, Becca.", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Hey, On Sunrise Powerlink, you guys were previously thinking that you would get approval in the first quarter. Now we're seeing second quarter. Something had definitely changed. Are there any issues, or is it just timing?", "Don Felsinger", "Hey, Becca. I'm an optimist here and even though the record has been complete and published for a year or more now, the fact that the remaining approval we need is from the U.S. forest department. I'm somewhat less concerned about the timing, even though I'm anxious because what they're doing is making sure that they have a complete record before they issue their decision, which will make it more litigation-proof going forward.", "So the fact that they may take another week, two weeks or a month, even though it causes me frustration, I think at the end, when we get that decision, it will be a better decision. So we don't expect any holdup. We're still waiting for approval. We firmly believe we're going to get it, just can't pinpoint the week.", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay. Thank you. And then back on the storage subject, $4 million in lower storage earnings. Can you talk specifically what that goes to, where the delta comes from?", "Joe Householder", "Becca, this is Joe Householder. That really is about a $2 million loss this quarter and there was a $2 million gain in the year-ago quarter. And it's a variety of small issues, some G&A, some depreciation, and property tax and a little bit of mark to market and some optimization. It's a whole variety of very small issues.", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "So the storage that you have is producing a net income loss?", "Joe Householder", "The storage operation as a whole had a small loss this quarter. Last year, a year-ago quarter it had a small gain.", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "And do you expect that loss to continue for the rest of the year?", "Joe Householder", "I don't believe so, no. That's not our expectation.", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Can you talk a little bit about what kind of swing we could see? I mean, will overall and annual basis, the 11.5 storage be positive net income for the year?", "Don Felsinger", "We're looking here at the numbers. I'm not sure what it's burdened with right now in terms of other cost. But let us do this. Let us take a look and see if we can give you a more cogent answer and then maybe post it on our website?", "Becca Followill \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "That's great. Thank you.", "Don Felsinger", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Ali [ph] with Decade Capital.", "John Ali \u2013 Decade Capital", "Hi guys.", "Don Felsinger", "Hey, John.", "John Ali \u2013 Decade Capital", "Just a quick question. I apologize if you've already covered this. There's a few other calls coming on but the book value of North American trading, it had been around 800. Is that still fairly consistent?", "Don Felsinger", "The book value in North American trading is actually quite a bit less than that and it is sitting on a fair amount of cash, which we would expect to distribute. And so the total cash distribution would be probably a lot more than just the book value, because we would distribute the cash prior to sale.", "John Ali \u2013 Decade Capital", "Okay. Can you give any numbers around what the total number or the total value left post the JPMorgan transactions?", "Don Felsinger", "Well, the JPMorgan transaction was 1.7 billion in total and our share of that was, I think it was like nine something and then after that, the remaining balance is the North American Power and Gas business. But the big difference there is the net book value is more in the 200 range to 250 range. We expect there's a fairly big cash distribution because we had a big cash build up for when we closed the deal with JPMorgan. It will pay off the inter company loans, and so that's why we expect our total proceeds be to around 2 billion.", "John Ali \u2013 Decade Capital", "So that $2 billion number in total proceeds hasn\u2019t changed?", "Don Felsinger", "Right, it has not changed.", "Mark Snell", "And Becca, if you're still there, we have found a sheet that has the numbers on it. Let me have Neal walk you through what our existing storage business has for earnings this year and then in the out years.", "Neal Schmale", "Yes, the sheet we dug up has some very fine print on it, Becca. But in any event, we expect the storage business to be just slightly positive this year and then it will be even more so next year, make a few million dollars and then continue to grow. So the results that we're seeing here are consistent with the plan.", "Don Felsinger", "Next question?", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Hi, just a follow-up on that storage question from Becca and the answer just given, it makes sense to me if in fact you're burdening storage with the overhead development costs for the significant build out you have because you're talking about a build out that's very large compared to the base. Are you folding all of that together in the numbers that you just gave? Is that what's going on?", "Don Felsinger", "The answer is yes.", "Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investment Research", "Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks a lot.", "Don Felsinger", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Sorry, just a couple of follow-ups. On is just on the LNG business, the $11 million related to the payment from our counter party for non delivery, is that the Tangu [ph] contract?", "Don Felsinger", "It was at our Costa Azul facility. That's really the extent of what we want to say about it.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "For example, if there were deliveries that actually took place in the foreseeable future than in theory the earnings from those volumes would be there, and so this is to make up for the volumes that weren't there, is that correct?", "Don Felsinger", "Yeah, just take this as this was both kind of a start up issue on the other end of the LNG business, meaning the supplier, and I would not expect to see these reoccur.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, got you. And then just on the wind assets that you've recently purchased into, the Hawaii project, and also I believe the projects in Indiana. Were those contributors at all to the generation earnings this quarter?", "Don Felsinger", "I don't believe they were. The Fowler Ridge I think will show up next quarter.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, and Hawaii, is that the same thing too?", "Don Felsinger", "There's no earnings for Hawaii yet.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, got you.", "Joe Householder", "Faisel, this is Joe. There is a small amount of Fowler Ridge earnings in there but not a lot.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "And in going forward how you guys plan to book the tax benefits from these renewable facilities, I take it on a GAAP basis you're going to amortize this stuff over a long period of time?", "Joe Householder", "On the GAAP basis, currently, we're on the flow-through method. We're taking them as they construct.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Felsinger for any additional or closing remarks.", "Don Felsinger", "Well, once again, thanks to all of you for joining our first quarter 2010 call. If you have any follow-on questions, as always, feel free to contact Steve, Glenn, or Scott. Thanks again. Have a great day.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference to Steve Davis. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steve Davis", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning we\u2019ll be discussing Sempra Energy\u2019s second quarter 2010 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, Executive Vice President; and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You\u2019ll note that slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. Please remember that this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.

These risks, uncertainties, and assumptions are described at the bottom of today\u2019s press release and are further discussed in the company\u2019s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentations are shown on a diluted basis.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don, who will begin with slide three.", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks, Steve. And again, thank you all for joining us. On today's call, I would like to accomplish several things. First, review with you our second quarter financial results and then give you an update on the status of the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture sales process. And finally, I'll give you an operational update on our utilities and infrastructure businesses.", "Now to the financial results, earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $222 million or $0.89 per share compared with $198 million or $0.80 per share in the same period last year. All of our core operating businesses performed well in the quarter. We have also announced that we'll begin a $500 million share repurchase later in the quarter.", "Now, let me hand it over to Mark so he can take you through some of our details of the financial results beginning with slide four.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter were $75 million compared with earnings of $70 million in the year ago quarter. For the first six months of 2010, SDG&E's earnings were $158 million, compared with $169 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to $11 million of higher liability insurance premiums for wildfire coverage.", "At Southern California Gas, the second quarter 2010 earnings were $69 million that's up from $65 million in the second quarter of 2009. For the first half of 2010, SoCalGas's earnings were $134 million, up from $124 million in 2009. The increase was due to improved operating results and a lower effective tax rate on operations that\u2019s offset by $13 million tax charge recorded in the first quarter due to the passage of the healthcare bill.", "Now, let's go to slide five. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $48 million in the second quarter, compared with earnings of $33 million in the same quarter of 2009. The increase for the quarter is primarily the result of renewable energy credits from new projects, partially offset by lower earnings due to scheduled plant maintenance on two power plants and from expenditures related to earthquake damage at our Mexicali power plant in Baja, California.", "For the first six months of the year, Generation recorded a loss of $5 million compared with earnings of $76 million in the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to an $85 million charge related to a proposed energy crisis litigation settlement. Now, please move to slide six.", "Sempra Pipelines and Storage recorded earnings of $39 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the loss of $27 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $5 million of earnings from the El Paso Pipeline acquisition, which was completed at the end of April. Last year's loss was primarily due to a $64 million asset write-off at our Liberty Gas storage project.", "Now turn to slide seven. Sempra LNG had earnings of $13 million in the second quarter of 2010. That compares with the loss of $12 million in the prior year's period. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from operations. You will recall that the Cameron LNG facility became operational and our supply contract with Tangguh Partners for the Energia Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009.", "For the first six months of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $45 million up from a loss of $19 million in 2009. 2010 results benefited from $11 million of earnings recorded in the first quarter related to payment for non-delivery of cargoes.", "Now, let's move to slide eight. Sempra Commodities broke even in the second quarter of 2010, compared with earnings of $85 million in last year's second quarter, due primarily to lower results in crude oil, oil products and natural gas, as well as higher costs for employee retention. The breakeven performance during the quarter was consistent with our expectations and is not expected to improve significantly prior to the completion of the joint venture sales process.", "Now let\u2019s move to slide nine. Here I\u2019d like to address our progress with the sale of RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture. We concluded the sale of the metals, oil and European gas and power business to J.P. Morgan, which provided Sempra with roughly $1 billion in proceeds, including distributions of earnings related to the sold businesses.", "I\u2019ll touch on the remaining JV sales elements in a moment, but given the positive conclusion to the J.P. Morgan transaction, we will be moving up our share buyback plans, and we will begin a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program later this quarter.", "As a reminder, there are two segments of our remaining businesses, the North American Gas and Power business and Solutions, our retail marketing business. We are still in active negotiations for these businesses and are on track to sell both. We currently expect to be able to announce something before the end of next month. We recognize this process has taken longer than we expected. This was due in part to the uncertainty around the Financial Reform Legislation coupled with a flat trading and the weak gaps in power markets. Once we finalize the sales process, we will address how and when we intend to deploy the remaining sales proceeds.", "And with that, I will turn it back over to Don who will begin with slide 10. ", "Don Felsinger", "Thanks Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, San Diego Gas & Electric received approval from the U.S. Forest Service for the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line. Now, that all major approvals have been received so we are moving forward with construction on this $1.9 billion project. When completed in the second half of 2012, the 500 kilovolt line will have the capacity to carry 1,000 megawatts of clean, reliable energy.", "Turning to our smart meter program at SDG&E, we have now installed more than 1.2 million meters. We have remained on schedule to have all 2.3 million Gas & Electric meter installations completed by the end of next year. Also at SDG&E, we recently filed an application for a $600 million tax equity investment in a proposed 309 megawatt wind farm in Montana. SDG&E had a previously approved power purchase agreement with this project. Financing for the renewable projects is difficult in this economy, and this investment by SDG&E will make this project a reality while providing cost-effective renewable energy to our customers and utility type returns to our investors.", "Finally at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we will be filing our applications for both utilities 2012 General Rate Cases later this year. The first step will be the filing of a Notice of Intent this month followed by a final rate case application in the fourth quarter of this year.

With regard to the sale of the different assets in the JV, is there a scenario that you foresee now because you're script inferred that it's not the case but you might retain part of this portfolio of businesses?", "Don Felsinger", "", "Well, Greg, I will have Mark give you some additional flavor on this, but we have been at this process for several months now, and a lot of that work was kind of slowed down by the financial reforms that were calling some uncertainty as they were being developed in Congress. I think that's all clear and behind us. We have had a lot of people look at our book, look at these businesses, and we're very comfortable now with what the book value of that business is and my sense is we're going to end up selling all of this business and announce something within the next month or two.", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "And you did not put in your official slides or in your presentation the $2 billion or book value bogey, does that infer that you now expect to sell it for less or more or is there anything that we should or shouldn't be inferring from that? ", "Don Felsinger", "", "Well, at the Analyst Conference for those of you that attended, we said that we expected to get about $2 billion of proceeds out of our portion of the sale of this business. We\u2019ve got $1 billion of proceeds from this transaction with J.P. Morgan, and we expect to get about $1 million from the remaining piece. So I think we're still on track with what we told everybody. ", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Changing tax, can we talk about the utilities and the regulatory backdrop? You know, my sense is that there is a general, some general trepidation about this rate-making cycle just sort of pertains their economy in California, it being an election year, uncertain leadership in the governor's office. You have been around the hoop a long time in California through a lot of regulatory, economic and political cycles. Can you tell us how you feel about your ability to continue to generate the types of returns on the business that you have historically in the context of this environment? ", "Don Felsinger", "Well, I mean, here at Sempra and our two utilities, we have a high level of comfort about where this condition is going and about the desire to continue to keep the utilities healthy to implement the things that were currently implementing in terms of infrastructure development and renewable procurement.", "So, remember in the State of California that the Regulatory Commission is its own statutory entity removed from the legislative branch of government. And every signal we get from the Utility Commission, and even from some of the politicians in Sacramento, is that California is doing the right things to avert another energy crisis that took place back in the early part of this decade and so the things that we're doing to build out infrastructure and put in smart meters, to develop renewables and get in the market are all the things that are being pushed at us from both Sacramento and from the utility commission in San Francisco.

Yes, but we do expect to get this process underway here pretty shortly.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. ", "Don Felsinger", "", "Lasan, if you remember at the analyst conference, we\u2019ve talked about doing this ASR when we had the entire business sold and we have such confidence now in what remaining half is worth and the fact that when they get to the finish line of the second half, they decide to go ahead and start the ASR early.", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Makes sense. I think it's a good idea. On the LNG front, just globally, just seems like that we're never going to see any gas come to the U.S., and I'm not sure what\u2019s causing all these global dynamic. And the first question is, a, what\u2019s happening with the global dynamic. Is this going to change in 2011, and second, do you foresee any potential problems with your long terms contracts to either Cameron or at Energia Costa Azul?", "Don Felsinger", "", "Well, I think you hit on it. But I don't think any of us in the room feel like we are smart enough to know where markets are going to be next year or the year thereafter. And that\u2019s why when we build facilities we always contract at the time that we build them and before we build them to make sure we get a return of and on our investments. That's what we have done with these two terminals.

", "Mark Snell", "", "Sure. Actually, all I was really saying was that the low volatility in the gas and power market has led to relatively flat markets and flat pricing. And so, therefore, the profitability in those markets has been low. And I think that had something to do with sort of some of the delays as people are kind of reassessing where these markets were going. But I think probably the biggest thing that has delayed us has been this financial reform which kind of put everybody on edge for a while, but we think that\u2019s really behind us now.

Is that how we should look at it, the process going forward? ", "Mark Snell", "If that\u2019s where the most value is, yes. It would be our desire just for simplicity to have one party we're negotiating with, but we know what the value of the book is for the business.

And then just going back, you mentioned that the buyback is still, right, so you had mentioned your assumptions were like 750 could be up to a billion. And, I guess, the forecast for next year, are you re-accreting that forecast as we stand today, based on the assumptions of the sale process? ", "Mark Snell", "Well, with respect to the sales process, we\u2019ve said that we would do between 500 and $1 billion of stock that we would buy back, and it's our intention to stick with that. This is the first 500 million and then we'll reassess the amount that we do after this once we get the second half sold.

And then other renewable development that\u2019s going to happen over the next year or so, next two to three years outside of the utility.", "Don Felsinger", "I don't think we talked about Copper Mountain having that much capacity. Our Mesquite facility in Arizona has the ability to have about 600 megawatts of solar development, and as I mentioned we have, in terms of land around our existing facilities, just the facilities being our combined cycle power plants, the ability to develop somewhere between 600 and a 1,000 megawatts of renewable.", "We are fairly advanced in negotiations.

", "Winfried Fruehauf - W. Fruehauf Consulting Limited", "Okay. A couple of questions on pipelines in the storage, if we\u2019re not exactly a bond I would say, especially if you add back last year's loss of $64 million, which gets us to sort of an adjusted earnings contribution for last year second quarter of $37 million, and versus $39 million this year. And if you back out $5 million from the El Paso Mexican pipeline acquisition, we're down to $34 million, what accounts for this performance? ", "Mark Snell", "", "Well, the pipeline in storage performance is roughly in line with the prior year. I mean the increase the Mexican operations were roughly in line with the prior year but they were up $5 million because of the El Paso acquisition South America, as I said, is roughly the same and the midstream operations, when you add back the write-off of liberty from last year are roughly, so that is pretty much similar, Neal? ", "Neal Schmale", "", "Just to elaborate a little bit, I think we're generally on track we told you in the past with respect to the earnings growth in the pipelines and storage business.

There is about 350 or more of goodwill on that. So there is about 2 billion left of book value. A fairly large chunk of that is reflected in cash, and that\u2019s about 700 million currently. But that varies, that goes up and down every day. It's down a little bit from the last time that we had this discussion, and that\u2019s mostly investments and inventories, but it can go up and down, and we fully expect to realize those proceeds or realize that in the form of proceeds once we have complete the sales.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Before you guys really split out kind of what was North American trade, what was the trading, the power and electric and what was the Solutions, can you do that or is that?", "Don Felsinger", "", "Well, we can.

", "Neal Schmale", "It's not anything that\u2019s particularly simple to explain without the benefit of slides. But what we're talking about is the 300 megawatt investment. The tax equity at $600 million represents about three quarters of the total cost of it and in the structure that we proposed; SDG&E would make that $600 million tax equity investment and would earn a rate of return on that investment, just like any other utility and investment.", "Now, the ratepayers, obviously, have to get a benefit from this and under the structure that\u2019s been proposed, the ratepayers would get a benefit including the tax benefits associated with the renewables and including renewable attributes at a cost of less than what they would have to pay otherwise, because, generally, the power here is going to be cheaper. So this is a very good project, it brings the renewables to the ratepayers less expensively than if SDG&E just went out and contracted but also allows SDG&E to earn a rate of return and now that the general economic state of affairs that allows this to happen is that the rate of return, the tax equity investors are requiring in today's market is considerably in excess of what SDG&E's return would be. So in effect, what we\u2019re able to do is ask that kind of benefit along to our ratepayers.", "Faisel Khan - Citi", "", "Okay. And then are these 209 megawatts, they're already ready to go if we were ready to invest in these assets or how does that work?", "Don Felsinger", "", "Actually that represents a contract that had already been entered into and previously approved by the CPUC with SDG&E.", "Faisel Khan - Citi", "", "Okay.

Yes, the higher liability insurance premiums.", "Don Felsinger", "", "Yes, it's actually both.

Our judgment right now is that, that is probably behind a little bit in the polls and probably, based on what we know now is unlikely to pass. But that having said all that, the public utilities commission has set in place a whole set of integrated policy objective revolving around renewables, revolving around conservation and revolving around technology, and I think that we are supportive of that comprehensive and integrated approach to what\u2019s being done in California.

The contracts that the utilities have signed they have all been approved by the Utilities Commission and the contracts we\u2019ve entered into on the unregulated side have all been approved by the Utilities Commission and that\u2019s an independent body. So I think there is effectively no impact if the proposition were to pass. ", "Vedula Murti - CDP US", "Okay.

And secondarily, when it comes to the second tranche of our proceeds when the remainder of the remaining sale gets closed, so I think we talked about various options and I think you indicated about making acquisitions as possibly is one of the options for proceeds.", "When you look across your business lines right now, where in all likelihood would you be focused on wanting to look for an acquisition or bolster at least or at least consider that as the primary focus if you were to look at an acquisition as opposed to the other alternatives?", "Don Felsinger", "", "Well, I think the first and foremost, the thing to recognize is that we do have a $15 billion capital program in front of us, and so we are fortunate and that we have a lot of high quality investment opportunities already on our plate and we think about spending $15 billion over the next five years those are representative of fairly good-sized acquisitions and I think first and foremost, we're going to concentrate on executing our plan and we're not really dependent upon acquisitions nor have we built any and really to our projects.", "And that said, as we look at the landscape, I do think that there is a possibility some time if we saw the right opportunity, we don't shy away from it and we do look at a lot of opportunities but I think most of our looking right now is may be in the utility space. Because we think that\u2019s one of the best investment opportunities are but generally speaking I think we're pretty satisfied with the investment program that we have right in front of us.

What\u2019s the update there, I think, that might have been hearing in July 20?", "Don Felsinger", "", "Yes. Let me just, for the benefit of everybody on the call, this is really an issue of, in my mind, of not much importance. We have a website that just details what\u2019s happening around our land dispute in Mexico. But to put this into perspective, after we had applied and received all of our permits to operate the LNG facility, we then acquired additional land and that's one of these additional parcels of land that has no bearing on the operational plants that is in dispute in a Mexican court. And there are some enterprising individuals that are trying to extort money from us by claiming that they have got some form of title to that land. That will be resolved separately. But I would not expect that any court action or decision would do anything to jeopardize the decision around the operations of those plants. There are hearings that are scheduled around this issue later this week and then going out into the next month or two but this will resolve itself on its own and will not have any impact on the operational plants. ", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management", "So, you're saying that whatever the decision is the plant will definitely continue to operate? ", "Don Felsinger", "", "Yes, there is absolutely no requirement in any of our permits that parcel of land is in dispute is necessary for us to own and to have operating permits sort of valid. ", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management", "Okay. But what about the hearing itself, what kind of decision do you expect and what exactly will be decided? ", "Don Felsinger", "", "The judge has been asked to determine whether or not this parcel of land is a requirement for us to have a permit to operate. I believe he now has in his hands all the evidence from all the regulatory bodies that this land is not required as a permit requirement. ", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management", "Okay. So irrespective what he does to land, you can continue but if you lose, you may still want to buy land in case, right? ", "Don Felsinger", "", "Yes, that could always be the case. If it's determined at some time in the future that we don't own this land, which we think we do and that would be the issue. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question will be a follow-up question from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Don, lot of talk about that vehicle makes its way, particularly in California; A, do you see evidence of this? And B, are you taking any steps to make it a reality? And C, how do you so it impacting SCG not SDG, but SCG?", "Don Felsinger", "", "The impact on SoCalGas? ", "Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes. Most of the electricity in covering is produced gas again, Correct? ", "Don Felsinger", "", "Very small because the amount of gas throughput to that system to generate electricity though for electric meter and is probably, at least in the next five to 10 years, is not going to be dramatic. But SDG&E is well underway in promoting the introduction of electric vehicles within a service territory. And I think all the utilities in California see this as an opportunity for increased utilization of infrastructure. But because of the way that we are balancing accounts for sales of electricity, really what happens is, the customer becomes a net beneficiary because we just utilize the system better. ", "Operator", "", "We'll go to the next follow-up question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "", "Hey, guys, a basic question. Any impact related to the oil spill in the Gulf on the development of potential net gas storage (Inaudible)", "", "? ", "Neal Schmale", "", "No impact. ", "Don Felsinger", "", "That was Neal. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. ", "Operator", "", "We have no other questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Donald Felsinger for your closing remarks.", "Don Felsinger", "Once again, thanks to all of you taking time on today to join us for our second quarter 2010 call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steven Davis", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations.  This morning, we\u2019ll be discussing Sempra Energy\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller; and participating via telephone is Debbie Reed, Executive Vice President.", "You\u2019ll note that Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. Please remember that this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical fact, and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.

It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis.  With that, I'll turn it over to Don, who will begin with Slide 3.", "Donald Felsinger", "Thanks, Steve. And again, thank you, all, for joining us.  On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, start with the review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results, and then talk about our dividend increase and how this aligns with our increasingly predictable earnings. And then finally, I'll give you an operational update on our Utilities and our Infrastructure businesses. ", "To the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $280 million or $1.15 per share compared with $288 million or $1.16 per share in the same period last year. If you exclude the results of commodities, who's assets have now been sold, earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose 34% or $1.18 per share from $0.88 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. And for the full year of 2010, we recorded earnings of $739 million or $2.98 per share compared with 2009 earnings of $1.12 billion or $4.52 per share.  When you exclude the results of Sempra Commodities from both years, earnings per share for the full year rose 14% to $3.61 per share in 2010 from $3.16 per share in 2009.  ", "Our core businesses performed well in 2010, and our earnings from those businesses exceeded our guidance for the year.  With regard to the dividend, I'd like to mention that Tuesday morning, after our board meeting had approved such, we announced a 23% increase on our quarterly dividend, which brings the annualized dividend to $1.92 per share. ", "Exiting the Commodities Trading business marks a new chapter for Sempra. We have narrowed our strategic focus, reducing both our risk profile and earnings volatility, while leveraging our core streams. This has allowed us to significantly increase our dividend, and be able to grow the dividend while still reinvesting capital for future growth.", "Now let me hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $105 million. That's up from $67 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $16 million higher margin, a $16 million benefit from the partial recovery of increased wildfire insurance premiums and a $9 million from the favorable resolution of prior year's tax matters.  Full year 2010 earnings increased to $369 million from $344 million last year. The increase of $25 million was due primarily to higher margins, partially offset by higher litigation reserves. ", "Now moving to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings were $74 million compared to $75 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year 2010, earnings for this business were $286 million, up from $273 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to improved operating margins.", "Now let's go to Slide 5. Our Generation business recorded earnings of $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $45 million in the same quarter 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 included lower earnings from operations, and a $6 million loss on the sale of our 50% interest in the Elk Hills Power Plant, offset by higher renewable energy tax credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. For the full year 2010, Generation recorded earnings of $103 million compared with earnings of $169 million in 2009. Results for 2010 reflect an $87 million charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigations, $31 million of lower earnings from operations, primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance in 2010, offset by $48 million higher renewable energy credits, primarily from the Copper Mountain Solar project. ", "Now let's move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $37 million in the same quarter of 2009. The current quarter included $6 million of higher earnings from operations, offset by a $5 million write-down of our investment in Argentina, which was net of related tax benefits. For the full year 2010, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $159 million compared with earnings of $101 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $64 million write-off of our Liberty Gas Storage assets in 2009 and a $13 million favorable resolution of prior year tax matters, also in 2009.", "Now please turn to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. That compares with earnings of $35 million in the prior year's period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were higher due to payments from customers for contracted cargoes that were not delivered.  For the full year of 2010, Sempra LNG had earnings of $68 million. That's up from earnings of $16 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to a full year of operation in 2010. You will recall that our Cameron LNG facility became operational, and our supply contract with the 10 new [ph] partners for the Energ\u00eda Costa Azul LNG facility became effective in the second half of 2009. ", "Now let's move to the next slide. As Don stated, our board authorized a 23% increase in the dividend. This takes the dividend to $1.92 per share on an annualized basis, up from our current annualized dividend of $1.56 per share.  Going forward, we plan to target a 45% to 50% payout ratio. ", "Now for an update on our share repurchases. The $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that began in 2010 will conclude by the end of this quarter. You will recall that at our analyst conference last year, we assumed $750 million of share repurchases, and we still may do that if it looks prudent to do so.  However, given the South American acquisition and other opportunities, it will likely be later this year before we make a decision on future buybacks.  And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don, who will begin with Slide 9.", "Donald Felsinger", "Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on some key activities with our businesses, and I'll start with our California utilities. In December, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company filed their General Rate Case applications. Like our last rate case, we are seeking to set rates for a four-year cycle. The general rate cases will establish the revenue requirements for 2012, and we've requested attrition mechanisms to adjust the margins for the years 2013 through 2015. The requested increase for 2012 of each utility is approximately 6% over present rates, and the attrition mechanisms would result in expected annual increases of 3% per year for the following three years. And also, the rate case plans call for new rates to be effective January 1, 2012. ", "To update you on some of the major utility capital projects at San Diego Gas & Electric, our construction is progressing as planned on the Sunrise Powerlink projects, and we remain on track to complete this project in the second half of next year. ", "Turning to our Smart Meter programs. At SDG&E, we have now installed approximately two million meters, and we're on schedule to complete all installations by the end of this year. And at Southern California Gas company, installations of meters are scheduled to begin late next year.", "Let's go to the next slide. At Sempra Generation, the 48-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar project in Nevada was completed in December, and the power generated by the plant is sold under a 20-year contract to Pacific Gas & Electric. The next solar project that we plan to start building is Mesquite Solar. This project is located near our Mesquite natural gas-fired plant outside of Phoenix, but we have enough plant to ultimately develop up to 700 megawatts of solar capacity. We have an agreement to sell the power produced by the first 150-megawatt phase of the project to PG&E under a 20-year contract, and that contract is now pending approval from the CPUC.", "As you may have seen, we have now selected a technology supplier and the EPC contractor for the project, and expect to start construction later this year. Completion of all 150 megawatts is anticipated to be done in 2013.  Construction continues on the Cedar Creek II Wind project, which is a 50-50 partnership with BP Wind Energy. This 250-megawatt project located in Northern Colorado remains on schedule for completion mid this year. The power produced by the facility will be sold under a 25-year power-purchase Agreement with a public service company in Colorado. And finally, at the end of last year, we sold our 50% interest in the 550-megawatt Elk Hills combined cycle plant to our former partner. We received proceeds of $175 million or $636 per kilowatt, which was a good price for a merchant asset. ", "Let's now go to the next slide. Last month, we announced the acquisition stakes in two electric distribution companies in South America, which we co-own with AEI. These were in Chilquinta Energ\u00eda in Chile and Luz del Sur in Peru.  As many of you may remember, Sempra initially invested in the companies 12 years ago. And you may recall that we previously talked about having a preference for control rather than co-ownership of these companies. Some of the attributes that we like about these investments are their strong operating performance, the sound regulatory environments and the stability and growth of the Chilean improving economies. The four-year rate case cycles, mechanisms to adjust revenues between rate cases and the pass-through of commodity cost to customers, the regulatory construct in both Chile and Peru has many of the same positive attributes as the utility regulation in California. ", "Chilquinta and Luz del Sur have achieved returns on equity in the mid-teens or higher, and have grown earnings at a double-digit pace annually. This $875 million acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings per share by $0.15 this year and $0.22 in 2012. Closing of the transactions is expected next quarter, and the regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain tax matters. ", "Now let's go to the next slide. Let me just summarize where we ended up. I'm very pleased with the results of our core businesses for both the quarter and the year. Excluding Sempra Commodities, earnings per share for the year increased 14% in 2010 to $3.61 per share. We had several key accomplishments, which include the successful exit from RBS-Sempra Commodities joint venture; the start of construction on the Sunrise Powerlink Transmission Project at SDG&E; the completion of Sempra Generation's Copper Mountain Solar project, which currently is the largest solar portable safe plant in service in the U.S.; and finally, the announcement of our accretive acquisition of electric utilities in Chile and Peru.", "As I've said in my opening remarks, our company has reached an important milestone. We've met all of our key financial and strategic objectives, which include: one, reducing our risk profile with the exit of Commodities; two, redeploying cash with a higher dividend payout and the buyback of our stock; and third, a greater focus on utility and contracted energy infrastructure investments.  We'll provide an update of our key initiatives in this area and discuss how our strategy aligns with policy and market trends at our upcoming conference in New York on March 23. And as always, we'll provide more detail on our earnings outlook and capital programs at that time. ", "But with that, let me stop, and open up the call and take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "On Sunrise, can you give us actually more of a detailed update of where you are? How much has construction progressed so far in terms of percentage terms? And how much more is left to go, how much capital has been spent?", "Donald Felsinger", "Let me have Neal take you through what we have spent today and what we've spent last year, and what's remaining.", "Neal Schmale", "Through the end of 2010, we've spent around $600 million on Sunrise, and the total project cost is estimated about $1.9 billion. We're in the field right now, constructing that project. And the anticipated completion date is in the middle of 2012.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And can you also remind us what the -- when you dropped El Dorado into rate base, what exactly was that book value when you dropped it in the rate base?", "Neal Schmale", "About $200 million.", "Donald Felsinger", "That will happen at the end of this year.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "The AEI transaction, the $875 million, how are you guys financing that? How much is equity and how much are you guys raising in debt to finalize that transaction?", "Donald Felsinger", "I'll have Mark give you the answer but basically, we're just taking some of the cash we have offshore, money from asset sales, and we'll probably end up doing a little more debt financing than we have in that country. But Mark, what is the breakdown there?", "Mark Snell", "Well, I think that's, generally speaking, correct. We had a lot of offshore cash with the sale of the Commodities business. We're using that. We're using a little bit of in-country financing, and we really have no anticipation of using outside equity or issuing any equity to finance it at all.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Is it fair to say like 60% equity, 40% kind of in-country debt? Is that fair?", "Mark Snell", ";", "So you mean as far as the final capital structure at the absolute underlying entities?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Or just for the $875 million -- did you have that much cash offshore, I guess? Do you have $875 million or -- just trying to figure out like how...", "Mark Snell", "Yes, we do have actually almost that much cash offshore. But ultimately, we will probably not spend it all, and we will do some but it's probably no more than about 30% debt.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Mark, you had talked about getting some collateral back from the Commodities' sale in 2011. Is that still the plan, or it all came back in 2010?", "Mark Snell", "Well, we do get some back in 2010. We still have more money to receive in 2011. On the balance sheet, we have about $787 million as of the end of the quarter, and we expect to collect that kind of ratably over the 2011, kind of on a quarterly basis. And that both represents collateral that's been posted, proceeds from the sales. And then we have certain assets that are running off. Most of those have done that now, that we were still holding, but we should get that money pretty ratably over the year.", "Donald Felsinger", "Is it safe to say, Mark, that the $787 million is the minimum we'd expect to see?", "Mark Snell", "It is. We have a couple assets that we may get more money for, and they're relatively small amounts. But I think generally speaking, we think this is sort of -- we've sort of wrote the investment down or the investment down to what the net realizable value that we think we'll get, and that's what's left, and it's kind of where we are. I would point out, though, I think what people lose track of, remember, this was an investment that we made 11 years ago for about $250 million. We really didn't pull any -- we had great earnings but didn't pull a lot of cash out it. But over the last couple of years now, we'll have pulled out about $3.6 billion, which is a fairly impressive amount.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "On your target capital structure, Mark, you had previously said being a sort of 50-50 debt-to-cap, now that your business model has changed, and you're much more highly regulated in the staple earnings. Are you rethinking that capital structure?", "Mark Snell", "We think about it all the time, but I'll defer a part of this to our analyst conference, because I'll give more detail on where our capital structure is going to go. I will say though that in summary, we will still be at roughly around 50%. Our leverage is, actually, over the next couple of years, will go up just very slightly, 51-ish kind of percent. But to be honest, I focus less on the actual capital structure, the debt-to-equity ratio than I do the cash flow coverage ratios. And that's really what we manage here more, because that's what the rating agencies tend to look at more for us. And it's probably a better indication of our financial strength, and sort of the capital structure sort of falls out of that, but I think you're right. As we become more predictable earnings and have the utilities play a bigger part and our contracted earnings play a bigger part in our net income, we're able to be a little more leveraged than we were before. We actually were, at one time, as low as 47% leveraged, and now we're kind of going up over around 51%.", "Operator", "Next up, we'll hear from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "One or two other cash questions, and then a utility one. Taxation and kind of the difference between GAAP and cash taxes, what are you expecting in 2011, or what's embedded in guidance?", "Joseph Householder", "This is Joe Householder. So on a GAAP basis, for 2011, we expect a GAAP tax rate around 28%. But now with the bonus depreciation enactment in December and our solar investment and so forth, and we don't expect to pay any real cash taxes for several years. So we'll have a tax rate on GAAP, but no cash out.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And at the utility, when we look at past Sunrise, what do you guys kind of see as kind of pertaining to next -- I don't want to call it major projects, but kind of $100 million, $200 million-plus project opportunities that are out there for either SoCalGas or San Diego Gas & Electric?", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, I think there's two things that are looming out there. One is that at SDG&E, we are still struggling to get developers to build renewable projects to meet what I think is going to be a 33% renewable target, and so we may have to have the utility step in and do some investments in that area. And I just think with the events in California around the San Bruno explosion and some of the other pipeline incidents that have happened recently in the U.S., that there's going to be a push to do more pipeline integrity and upgrades in California. So I would expect those two to kind of be the major things that we would have for the utilities beyond the current financial period, the five-year period.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "You've generally been hesitant to build generation within the -- which builds significant generation within the utility, is building renewables simply just trying to fill a spot that the market's not filling already?", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, we have found that we are good at signing contracts with developers, but developers aren't very good at being able to raise the money and make it happen. And so I think we see ourselves as the builder of last resort. And if California stays on this path to get to 33%,  we very much will have to step in. And when you look at the other utilities, now, don't forget about the fact that we have the utilities in South America, and we are building a small hydro project in Peru, but I would expect that we will look at opportunities in South America to deploy capital in those utilities also.", "Operator", "Next up, we have Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I wanted to touch base with you on a couple of things. First of all, just the buyback, I'm sorry if I missed this, how much was left in the buyback between now and the end of the quarter?", "Mark Snell", "Well, this is Mark. We'll be finished with the $500 million by the end of the quarter. Obviously, I can't tell you exactly how many shares they have left to fulfill. But we've been told by our agents that's handling this that they'll be finished by the end of the quarter of this quarter. And then beyond that, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we had originally planned to do $750 million at the last analyst conference last year. We still obviously have the authorization to do that, but we're going to wait till later in this year to look at what our other investment opportunities are before we commit to anything.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "The South American acquisition, just to make sure I understood you answered a viable question, it sounds like that you were going to finance the $875 million with cash on hand and about 30% debt, is that right?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, it's cash on hand and debt. And initially, we have financed it with short-term borrowings. And now, we're fixing those into more long-term borrowings as we go forward.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "But I mean, just in general, when we look at the accretion number, I mean, should we be think about what the cash on hand was going to earn, is that how we should think about it?", "Mark Snell", "Right, but the difference is, is the investment in these utilities versus just paying down debt. But I mean, I think we did that math for you. We told you it's $0.15 accretive this year, about $0.22 next year.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I just was wondering what that was based on. Just in general, with this acquisition and just in general sort of philosophically, how do you guys feel about sort of the -- how are you going to manage sort of the currency fluctuations, if you are? And how comfortable do you feel in terms of how big you get in sort of international? I mean, is this an area where we're going to see potentially a lot more acquisitions or just sort of the flavor for how you feel about the international arena, which has had mixed results for different utilities?", "Donald Felsinger", "Let me go first, and I'll just take the strategy. When you think about the amount of money that we have invested internationally, we've got about $2.5 billion invested in Mexico. And with this acquisition, we'll have about $1.5 billion invested in South America. That's about 20% of Sempra's total overall investments. We like the spaces that we're in. As I mentioned, in South America, we've been there 12 years in Chile and Peru, we really like the regulatory schemes that are in place. And the opportunities to invest there are things that we feel pretty comfortable in. So we will get bigger there, but from the standpoint of is that our primary focus? It's not. You look at our capital program, it's still -- the majority is invested here in the U.S. and California. From the standpoint of how we manage those currencies, let me have Mark take that question.", "Mark Snell", "I guess the first thing to point out is that the regulatory construct in both Chile and Peru, our rates have inflationary indexes in them that it allows for adjustments in rates or inflation. Now that doesn't necessarily always correspond dollar for dollar to the currency changes, but it is an approximation and it sort of alleviates sort of the wildest swings in currency affecting us. But generally speaking, we won't hedge sort of revenues or that kind of thing. Now that said, we do, on occasion, on specific types of items where we have currency exposure and usually this is in Mexico, we have kind of an odd tax situation because of the way the Mexican taxes work, that we do have certain exposures that we hedge from time to time. But they're relatively small, and so I don't think you're going to see us as a matter of course, due to large currency hedges, because I think we have built in to our regulatory structure of kind of a natural hedge that's built into that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Just finally, the DRA put out a report on the cost of renewables. I think they were supportive of the renewable goals, I think, but they were concerned about the cost that some of these renewable projects are costing I guess. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that, any general thoughts, because we are talking about a pretty heavy goal here of 33%. And just in general, just if you could give any flavor as to how you see things potentially, how you guys are situated versus others with respect to that issue, and just if you could address the topic and sort of just generally speaking, how you think about that, the issue of cost and these renewable mandates?", "Neal Schmale", "Well, first of all, there's no doubt that the cost of renewables is greater than the cost of fossil-fired generation right now, particularly with where gas prices are. On the other hand, the State of California has taken a policy objective to increase the amount of renewables and increase conservation. And we're proceeding in accord with that policy objective. I would offer the comment that the price of renewables is coming down. I think people realize that in order to get these kinds of projects going, perhaps, a little bit of a premium would have to rebate in the early stages. But I think over time, the cost of renewables are going down, and I think the Public Utilities Commission has been pretty thoughtful about the way they're approaching all of these issues.", "Donald Felsinger", "I'd just follow-up on what Neal was saying. From the time that we started investing in both wind and solar panels, we have seen the price come down each year and probably come down even more as we've seen the world economy soften. I think there's a certain amount of frustration that are not coming down to staffs is maybe some of the consumer advocates would like to see them come down. But we are seeing reductions, and I think we will continue to see reductions, as we continue to implement more and more wind and solar here in the U.S. Not much else I can add to that, except this is really a long-term strategy for the states that are doing it. And I think California is sticking to the course that we are going to move to have a substantial amount of our energy supply come from renewables, and that's the plan we're on.", "Operator", "Next, we have Ashar Khan with Visuim Asset Management.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "But can we get some perspective, I guess, there's a little bit confusion as analysts projected you guys going forward. Could you elaborate about the growth rate, what to expect in the next five years with, I guess, this year as being a base? And then I guess a follow-up question, I don't know if you can give us some light on it or not, is can we expect some growth as you've done these acquisitions, and as you're looking towards utilizing the remaining part of the buyback? Is there some growth next year? I'm trying to understand is like '11 a good year where from which growth can start going forward every year?", "Donald Felsinger", "We're going to cover off a lot this when we meet in March in New York. But let me have Mark kind of give you a highlight on some of those issues you raised.", "Mark Snell", "Look, I think again, we will go into detail on this at the analyst conference, and I don't want to take all the wind out of that. But I think we do have a $15 billion capital program over the next five years. We are going to continue to grow from this 2011 base. I think that you're going to see growth that is kind of in the top quartile of our peer group. And along with that, we're going to be paying a much more competitive dividend. And so, I think the details of that, we'll flush out for you when we can do it by business unit, and as we normally do at the meeting.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "And what is the quartile growth rate that you look at your comps? What would that be?", "Mark Snell", "I think the average growth rate for the utility is it something around 4%, 3% or 4%. And we will be a little bit better, we'll be better than that, we'll be more in the 6% to 8% range.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Starting off with this year as a base, right?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, or you could start next year. Last year will be a little better.", "Operator", "Next up, we have Craig Shere with Touhy Brothers.", "Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc.", "I think three companies that have LNG terminals domestically have kind of talked about the possibility by 2015 through the end of the decade, converting those in whole or in part to export capacity. Do you have any thoughts on that for yourselves or for the industry?", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, it's actually four if you take -- there's four in North America that gone to the FERC and asked for -- seeking approval to build liquefaction facilities. We have not made that leap yet. We're looking at it. What we have done at our U.S. facility, we've asked the FERC to give us the ability export, so we could take existing LNG out of the tank, as necessary and move it out of the country, and we recently did some export of LNG out of our Mexican facility. Liquefaction facilities are very expensive endeavors. And so you'd have to believe long term that U.S. natural gas prices are going to be depressed to the point as compared to the world market, that this would make sense. And we would only do this if, in fact, we get people to sign a long-term contracts to bring their gas to our facilities to be liquefied. We have found no such entity yet. So when we do, we will seriously consider it, but that market's not there yet.", "Operator", "We have Mark Barnett with MorningStar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "Now that you now did -- the earning stream is certainly shifting a little bit towards the regulated and contracted side, but you've mentioned in the past that there is still some U.S. infrastructure opportunities you might be looking at, maybe with the joint venture in the Marcellus or, perhaps, some generation assets. I'm just wondering what your outlook is on that for now.", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, I mean, we like the stage that we're in, in natural gas infrastructure. And we think that the trends that are currently here and will continue to be even stronger. To use natural gas as the fuel for industry and the fuel for generation all make sense. And so the investments that we continue to focus on are in that space, both Pipelines & Storage, other midstream and look for opportunities. Also in Mexico, as you're aware, we did a joint venture with PEMEX [Petroleos Mexicanos] last year to be in the natural gas infrastructure space with them as a partner. But that's the general area. And I think if you're going to be with us, Mark, when we meet in New York next month, we're going to have each of the businesses go through and talk about the opportunities they see in the space.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "And a quick question on the acquisition, that transaction, the accretion of $0.15, is that all in an operating basis, or is there going to be some accounting noise?", "Mark Snell", "I guess I don't know exactly what you mean by that but I mean, that's a net effect to our bottom line. There's no real -- I don't know...", "Joseph Householder", "This is Joe Householder. The only thing I would say that's different from that is there will be probably a one-time gain. We don't know exactly how much because of the accounting rules require us to step up the basis of our half the debt. That is kind of the operating after financing that we estimated the number.", "Mark Snell", "Yes, the $0.15 doesn't anticipate this one-time gain. That would be just kind of a one-off, and actually a non-cash item, so we still tend to ignore it.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "Last quick question, just maybe an update on what you're hearing from regulators with the two outstanding rate requests.", "Donald Felsinger", "You're talking about the rate application we filed?", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "Yes.", "Donald Felsinger", "I mean, it's just that this is standard operating process we go through. We make these filings. I think what will be key is there are several, I guess, at least, PG&E is ahead of us in the process. And so the discussion and the outcome around their rates case will be somewhat instructed, but there's really nothing unusual about this application. And at this stage of the process, it's all normal.", "Operator", "Next up, we'll hear from John Ali [ph] with Decade Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was hoping you can clarify something for me. I thought on the third quarter call, you guys said the CAGR was 8% to 9%, off 11%? I guess, I just wanted to understand what changed in your plan?", "Mark Snell", "I think, actually, what we said was 7% to 8%, so maybe it was just a misunderstanding there. But, that said, since the third quarter call, we've had a slight further deterioration to gas prices along the forward curve. That's probably been the biggest effect. And then we've also -- the bonus depreciation, which the rules that came in, what that did was that lowered our -- because it's great for us from a cash flow perspective, because we get a lot of cash back early. But the earnings effect of that is, is that the deferred taxes that result from that accelerated depreciation get offset against the rate base. And it lowers our earnings until we can find replacement investments to put that cash in. And so that is affecting our growth a little bit.", "Operator", "Next, we have Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management", "Just a quick question on the rate case. I know that you filed a proposal to delay your rate case by six months at Edison. Can you just give us an update on how that's going and whether you think you'll be doing concurrently with that ascend or six months later or even more than six months later?", "Donald Felsinger", "Michael, we had asked at one time to help the commission with their workload to delay our rate case, and that never got accepted. So we're back just at the part of the normal cycle. So there's been nothing unusual done around the timing of the rate cases for SoCalGas or SDG&E.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management", "So you will be doing it at the same time as SC?", "Donald Felsinger", "We will. Yes, because it was being done at the same time, we had thought from discussions we have had with some of the staff that it would be a relief for them if we were to delay ours, and so we put a proposal together to delay ours, so that they could have more time to work on Edison's and work on ours. I think they fixed their workload issue, and so we're both doing these now in parallel.", "Operator", "We will go to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "So I guess in Mexico, has there been any sort of disruption at all in your facility, resulting from some of these legal debates that go on, on the LNG side?", "Donald Felsinger", "No. A lot of this stuff is background noise that tends to be played out as a bigger issue in the media. But the fundamental thing that's going on in Mexico is that there are several individuals that are trying to extort money from us over a disputed piece of land. And to that end, they have tried to use all means available to impact our permits and ability to operate our LNG facility. Every time they have tried this, both the federal government and the state government have stepped in and slapped them down, and that's going to continue. So this will eventually work its way through the system, but it's -- the federal government has been very clear and explicit that this terminal is under their jurisdiction. It's strategic to Mexico. It provides Mexican customers, and are not going to let local entities or individuals that are trying to use the various systems in Mexico to extort money from us and impact the operation of this plant. So this will die a natural death at some point in time.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "On the tax rate in the fourth quarter, even if I add back the tax rate...", "Mark Snell", "6%?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "6%, right, is there besides -- either add back the tax credits for the renewable power, you started at a very low at tax rate, just trying to figuring out like what drove that lower tax rate for the fourth quarter.", "Joseph Householder", "Yes, there were a number of things. As we've mentioned with respect to SDG&E, they have a tax audit resolution that was $9 million. The parent also had a similar benefit, about $10 million benefit from the closure of an audit. We had a $15 million benefit from the increase in the impairment of the Argentine asset. And then lastly, there was a California State tax benefit of consolidation of about $18 million, which was higher than normal, and had to do with the commodity sale, a lot of foreign income and U.S. losses from writing off some of the goodwill at the commodity. So there was a whole host of issues and it drove it rate down.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And for this year, the 28% tax rate, does that include Cedar Creek in terms of the tax benefits in that facility?", "Joseph Householder", "Yes, 28% would be the all-in rate including everything. [indiscernible]", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up from Michael Lapides.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Guys, we've seen in the market some of the companies that are both gas infrastructure as well as E&Ps, consider alternatives to their corporate structure, whether it's Williams or others. Just curious, I know you guys get asked this constantly, is what you're seeing out there in the market give you pause or give you a chance to kind of rethink whether there's a different corporate structure that maybe appropriate for Sempra?", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, we always look at that, but we look at it based on long-term trends. And so when we look at what is our job here to create shareholder value with the assets we own, it's whether it makes sense to keep them in the same family or put them in the different families. Right now, we're paying attention to it, but the structure we have, we think make sense.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Mark, could you quantify the bonus depreciation in 2011 and '12?", "Joseph Householder", "Well, it's 0 in '11, and it's going to be probably about $25 million to $30 million in '12.  I'm not sure if you're question was how much is the bonus depreciation and what's the effect on it.", "Mark Snell", "What is the question?", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "You made the comment that it wouldn't negatively impact rate base. So I'm just trying to understand how much the bonus depreciation is and I...", "Mark Snell", "The negative impact on earnings is about $25 million in '12.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "And nothing in '11?", "Donald Felsinger", "Nothing in all '11. And it runs on between '12 and '15, between, let's say, $20 million, $30 million and $40 million a year. But this is assuming that we have done nothing to backfill into the capital spending program. And as I mentioned, I think that there are going to be ample opportunities now that we have the additional cash and an opportunity to put more rate base in place without increasing customer rates to do some of these things in terms of infrastructure that are needed like pipeline integrity, additional shut-off valves, renewable investments, so forth and so on. Neal, you had a comment?", "Neal Schmale", "Yes, just to add a little bit of background for the people that are on the call, what we're talking about here is the impact of bonus depreciation at the utilities and more particularly, the fact that deferred taxes eventually will be subtracted from rate base. And the impact of that is the earnings we were talking about. But to elaborate a little bit more, is I think the key thing is that this is a result of us getting a lot more cash quicker because of the bonus depreciation, so accumulative cash...", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "How much is that?", "Neal Schmale", "Is a very positive thing.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "When you say you get a lot more cash, how much is that? That's only the $25 million, or is the $25 million is the impact on the rate base?", "Neal Schmale", "No, it's a lot more than that. Effectively, we're writing, you're basically writing off up to 100% of your capital investments in a signal year, and so you're getting the tax benefit of that write-off. So if you write off $1 billion, that's $350 million of extra cash.", "Donald Felsinger", "They're big numbers.", "Neal Schmale", "Yes, they're big numbers.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "So I guess, either, I'm not making myself clear, or I'm just very sick. What's the cash flow impact from bonus depreciation in 2011?", "Joseph Householder", "I don't think I have the number for 2011. In 2012, SG&E's cash is about $225 million.", "Neal Schmale", "This is Neal Schmale. Another way, perhaps, to look at it from a consolidated standpoint is to go back to Joe's comment that we will not be paying federal cash taxes for several years. So if you want to sort of compare the prior statutory rate in some assumed level of deferred, I mean, these are significant numbers in terms of the cash flow coming in.", "Donald Felsinger", "To the extent that we can work up and give you actual cash flow numbers, we will do that, and if not, we'll definitely do it when we get together in New York for the analyst conference.", "Operator", "There's no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over to Don Felsinger for closing remarks.", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, once again, thanks to all of you for taking time to join us today for our fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can get a hold of Steve Steve, Scott and Victor. We'll see you all in New York next month. Have a great day.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steven Davis", "Thank you, Rochelle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's first quarter 2011 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Don Felsinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debbie Reed, Executive Vice President; and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You\u2019ll note that Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. Please remember that this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.

It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don, who will begin with Slide 3.", "Donald Felsinger", "Thanks, Steve. And again, thank you all for joining us. On today's call, we'll start by reviewing our first quarter financial results, and I'll then give you an operational update on our businesses. Early this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $258 million or $1.07 per share, compared with $106 million or $0.42 per share in the same period last year. ", "The first quarter of last year included a $96 million or $0.38 per share charge related to the settlement of energy crisis litigation. Excluding the impact of this charge in last year's first quarter, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 34%. All of our businesses are performing well, and each of our business units reported an increase in earnings in the first quarter over the year-ago period. ", "There are 2 things I'd like to highlight before Mark goes into the details of the financial results. As we discussed at the March analyst conference, with our exit from the commodities trading business, we have refocused our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. This quarter's strong results across all of our business segments demonstrates our execution on that strategy going forward.", "And second, a key element of our renewable business strategy is in the contracting of our portfolio of projects at Sempra Generation. We recently received regulatory approval for the first 150-megawatt phase of the 700-megawatt Mesquite Solar project and signed contracts for 2 wind projects totaling about 175 megawatts.", "Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Don. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $89 million compared with earnings of $83 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $7 million of higher authorized margins, offset by $5 million of higher wildfire insurance premiums this year. And in last year's first quarter, we had a $3 million charge related to the passage of the healthcare bill.", "At Southern California Gas, first quarter 2011 earnings were $68 million. That's up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2010. Last year's results included a $7 million regulatory award and a $13 million tax charge related to passage of the healthcare bill. ", "Now let's go to Slide 5. Our generation business [Sempra Generation] recorded earnings of $44 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $51 million in the same quarter in 2010. The increase for the quarter is due to lower operating and maintenance costs, less scheduled plant maintenance and an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement last year. ", "Now please move to Slide 6. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $54 million in the first quarter of 2011, up from earnings of $38 million in the same quarter of 2010. The quarter benefited from $8 million of higher earnings from pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010, and from $6 million of higher operating results in Chile and Peru. I'd also like to mention that in the next quarter, we expect to report a onetime gain related to our increased ownership stake in Chile and Peru, due to a step-up of our prior investment to fair value. The size of the gain has not yet been determined, and it was not included in our earnings guidance that we previously provided for this year.", "So now let's please go to Slide 7. Sempra LNG had earnings of $33 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $32 million in the prior year's period. Both quarters included $11 million of earnings from customer payments related to contracted cargoes that were not delivered. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Don who'll begin with Slide 8.", "Donald Felsinger", "Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, Governor Brown signed into law California's Renewables Portfolio Standard legislation, which calls for a 33% renewables mix by 2020 for all retail providers of electricity in the state. You may recall that SDG&E had previously made a voluntary commitment to reach 33% renewable. Since the beginning of this year, SDG&E has signed contracts for about 700 megawatts of renewable energy and is well on its way to reaching a 33% threshold. ", "Now moving to Sunrise Powerlink. Construction on the project is well underway. We're now installing towers and have more than 100 towers in various stages of construction. The project is proceeding according to plan, and we expect to complete this line in the second half of next year. ", "And finally, at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we filed our applications for both utilities' 2012 general rate cases last December. The CPUC rate case plan calls for a decision in approximately March of next year with rates retroactive to January 1 of next year. ", "Now let's go to Slide 9. Earlier this year, the CPUC opened up proceedings to assess new safety and reliability regulations for natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. We fully support the commission's efforts and are actively participating in this process. Last month, SoCalGas and SDG&E responded to the commission's request for records supporting the maximum allowable operating pressures of their pipelines. This extensive review renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set and that we operate our system safely. ", "Our utilities operate about 4,000 miles of transmission pipelines, and the records reviewed covered about 1,600 miles of those pipelines in populated areas. Federal regulation issued in 1970 requires specific documentation of pressure testing for transmission pipelines built after the regulation went into place. Approximately 500 miles of the pipelines were installed after 1970, and our records and operating procedures give us a very high degree of confidence that all of this pipeline has been pressure tested and is operating safely.", "Of the remaining 1,100 miles installed before 1970, we have records indicating that nearly 700 miles of this pipeline was pressure tested. The remaining 400 miles of pipeline had operating pressures determined by using alternate procedures under state and federal regulations. Of these, 170 miles have been smart-pigged, meaning sophisticated devices were inserted into the pipeline and inspected to make sure they are safe. ", "We also have extensive construction and/or operating records that support the maximum operating pressure on all of those pipelines. We have also voluntarily taken a number of precautions to provide an added margin of safety, including further reducing operating pressures in certain pipeline segments, conducting tests to validate pipeline strength, assessing possible replacement of certain segments and conducting bimonthly patrols and weekly surveys.", "I want to stress that safety is our top priority. We have a strong pipeline-integrity program in place, and our financial plan includes a significant amount of spending and investment in this area. The costs we've incurred this year to gather records has been less than $2 million, and we don't expect our utility earnings plans to be impacted by these efforts. We don't know what the commission will ultimately decide regarding new pipeline regulations but should new requirements result in incremental costs, we would expect to recover those costs.", "Now let's move to the next slide. At our analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Just in the first 4 months of this year alone, we've made significant progress toward that goal. Last month, we received CPUC approval for a 20-year contract to sell PG&E the output of the first 150-megawatt phase of our Mesquite Solar project. Construction will begin next month, and we expect to complete this first phase of the project in early 2013. When fully developed, the Mesquite Solar complex has the potential to generate up to 700 megawatts of solar energy.", "Two of Sempra Generation's wind development projects also reached important milestones with the signing of long-term power sales contracts. Energ\u00eda Sierra Ju\u00e1rez is a wind project located about 70 miles east of San Diego and just south of the U.S.-Mexico border. The first phase to be developed is a 156-megawatt project. Given our land position and the wind resource there, we have the opportunity to develop as much as 1,200 megawatts over time. ", "For the first 156-megawatt phase, SDG&E has signed a 20-year contract for the output from the facility. The contract is subject to approval by the CPUC and the FERC. Pending the receipt of these approvals, we expect to begin construction next year and to complete this phase of the project in 2013. ", "We've also reached a preliminary agreement with BP Wind Energy to bring them into the project as an equal partner. Sempra Generation also signed a 20-year power sales contract with Maui Electric for the 2,100-megawatt Auwahi Wind project on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The contract is subject to the approval of the Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission, and we expect the project will be operational late next year. ", "And finally, I'd like to mention that construction is almost complete at the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek II wind project in Colorado, and operations are expected to begin this quarter. This project is a 50/50 joint venture with BP Wind. Consistent with our long-term contracting strategy, there's a 25-year agreement in place for the sale of the project's power. ", "Now move to the next slide, if you would. Last month, Sempra Pipelines & Storage increased its ownership stake in 2 South American electric utilities. We now own 100% of Chilquinta Energ\u00eda in Chile and 76% of Luz del Sur in Peru. Luz del Sur is a publicly traded company in Peru, and the remaining 24% of shares on Luz del Sur are held by institutional investors and the general public. ", "Last week, the groundbreaking of Luz del Sur's 98-megawatt Santa Teresa hydroelectric project was held in Peru. This $150 million run-of-the-river project marks Luz del Sur's entrance into generation and is expected to be complete in 2014. We're excited about the opportunities to grow the business in both Chile and Peru. ", "Now please go to the last slide. Let me conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our strong financial results for the quarter, where refocusing of our strategy on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure drove our strong results across all the business segments. These results have us on track and meet our earnings guidance for the year.", "I'm also proud of our recent accomplishments, which include contracting and development of renewable energy resources and closing the accretive South American acquisition. With that, let me stop, and we'll take any questions that any of you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Just have a question on your renewable CapEx. Given the progress that you've made during the first quarter and also, I think, the new information -- or, at least, I don't recall BP being an equal partner in that Sierra Juarez project -- is your CapEx for renewables still slated to be in the range of about $600 million next year?", "Donald Felsinger", "Do you mean next year or this year, Leslie?", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Well, this year. At your analyst presentation, you had about $200 million this year, about $600 million next year. So if these projects all do get regulatory approval moving forward, are those CapEx numbers still good? Or does, because BP is involved now, the CapEx number come down.", "Donald Felsinger", "I'll let Mark, take this.", "Mark Snell", "Leslie, no, there's about $600 million. We actually anticipated BP or a partner in these wind projects, and so that was in our plan.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Just a few quick things. The RBS investment, my understanding was that, that was going to be sort of coming down throughout the year. And it seems like it's pretty much holding in there. Could you elaborate a little bit what's going on in that in the balance sheet?", "Donald Felsinger", "I'll have Mark take you through this, but I think what we have stated is that by the end of this year, we'll recover all the investment out of the commodities joint venture.", "Mark Snell", "Yes, Paul, that's correct. What we did have happened -- unfortunately, it happened about 3 days after the quarter ended. We got about $330 million, so that reduced our investment, and you'll see that in the next quarter. And we're hoping to get kind of ratable payments over the next 3 quarters, bringing it down to 0 at year end.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. And then also you mentioned something about the wildlife reserve premium impacting earnings and I'm sorry; I just didn't get that. Could you just repeat that again?", "Mark Snell", "Okay, well what we had was about $5 million of additional insurance expense related to the wildfire insurance premium. Over, under -- at the utilities, under our old -- or our current rate case, we incurred higher cost related to wildfires for insurance. And we did recover some of that in the z-factor last year, and we may recover some of this later on. But right now, we don't have a recovery mechanism in place, and so it's being expensed.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. I noticed that the liability actually went down. I mean, the asset -- no, the liability I think went down about $150 million. I know there was a $300-million receivable that you guys had at the end of the year. Could you just describe just a little bit on the balance sheet what's going on with that reserve thing? Is that...?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, sure. Well, of course, that asset receivable has got -- it's separate and apart from the insurance premiums. But the liability going down is related to payments that we've made during the period. We paid about $100 million during the period, and we moved about $71 million to long-term because it won't be paid out for a couple of years.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then, just in terms of the pipeline, it sounds like you guys pretty much have all your records, and you're not finding any -- there doesn't seem to have any issue in terms of collecting all of that and what have you. And is that pretty much getting it right?", "Donald Felsinger", "Paul, no, I had anticipated that there would be some interest in this, and we invited Mike Allman, who is the CEO of that business to join us this morning. And Mike, would you like to respond?", "Michael Allman", "Yes, that's right Paul. We've completed a substantial review of our records, and we are really in pretty good shape at this point. So I'm happy with what we've found so far.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Have you guys asked for a memorandum account for this? Or do you think that's necessary?", "Michael Allman", "We did ask last week, and our expenses have been relatively low so far. We've been able to complete this review by reassigning existing resources, but last week we did file for a memo account to capture expenses going forward in case we need that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move to Ashar Khan with Visium.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Just wanted to go over -- Mark, can you just -- is there any update? You had -- I believe there was some portion of earnings from the analyst day, like 9% for this year and 15% for next year, which were to be end of the contract and development projects. Has that number a little bit changed? And as we stand right now, more firming of those things or no?", "Mark Snell", "Are you referring to -- do you mean the uncontracted earnings, the ones that we don't have?", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "That's correct. There was like, in your chart, like 9% for this year and like 15% for next year that were to be contracted or development project earnings. I was wondering if there's any update on those numbers as we stand today.", "Mark Snell", "They're still relatively close. We're a little bit ahead of schedule on some of the contracts for the renewable projects, but I wouldn't be changing those numbers at this time. Hey, one other thing, too, is we also did -- we did -- some of that was the anticipation close of Chile and Peru, and that has happened. So that does update it a little bit.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Yes, that I have. I appreciate it.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Ashar.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And next, we'll hear from Debra Bromberg with Jefferies & Company.", "Debra Bromberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a question on Peru. I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the upcoming presidential runoff election, and any implications of a possible win by Humala?", "Donald Felsinger", "Well, I mean it's -- the elections are about 3 weeks away. Neal and I went down to Peru last week for the groundbreaking of the hydro project and had a chance to meet with the current president. He's fairly optimistic that Fujimori is going to win. His insights are his insights. But I think, as we look at it, and I think both Humala and Fujimori -- both came out of the back of the race and are now in a runoff. Whatever happens here with either one of them, I don't see any real changes to the regulatory framework that we have in Peru. So I think we left there with a pretty high degree of comfort that the economy in Peru is going to continue to grow and whichever one of these individuals end up becoming President will kind of maintain the status quo.", "Operator", "Next, we'll move on to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "Just a couple of real quick questions. First, anything new on those remaining PEMEX assets? I know they delayed the decision or decided to wait for now, but have you been in negotiations? Have you been talking to anyone from PEMEX? I mean, what's...", "Donald Felsinger", "There's been no change. We had expected, when we made this acquisition, that PEMEX was going to be required to exit. So far, they haven't. The good news is that having PEMEX in the partnership, we have a fairly robust portfolio of new projects that we're looking at. So I think we were kind of indifferent at the very beginning whether or not they stayed as a partner or exited. We're indifferent. We see the business still to continuing to grow.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "Okay. And just lastly, about the potential for the buyback later this year. You'd obviously mentioned maybe a small one later on. I mean, any more -- given maybe some new project opportunities or something like that, is that any more or less likely, you think, at this point? Or...", "Donald Felsinger", "I don't think there's much update over what we said at the analyst conference last month. But, Mark, do you want to add some more color to it?", "Mark Snell", "No, I think that's right. I mean, at the analyst conference, we said that we would kind of address this later in the year, as we looked whatever our capital spend was and where we were. I will point out that the share count that we gave at the analyst conference did not anticipate a buyback, and we're sticking with that number for the year, so. But it's something we'll look at later on in the year and decide if there's anything that make sense.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Don Felsinger for any additional or closing remarks.", "Donald Felsinger", "Wow, this is the shortest call we've ever had. I guess the business is getting too simple for you guys. Hey, once again, thanks for joining us in this first quarter call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Steve, Scott [ph] or Victor [ph]. Thanks for taking time with us. Have a great day.", "Operator", "And that will conclude today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steven Davis", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2011 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Don Felsinger, Executive Chairman; Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Neal Schmale, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Snell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Householder, Senior Vice President and Controller.", "You'll note that Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. Please remember that this call contains forward-looking statements that are not historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. As you know, they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, so future results may differ materially from those expressed on our call.

It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don.", "Donald Felsinger", "Thanks, Steve, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today's call by commenting on our recent CEO succession process. We'll then review our second quarter financial results and then provide an operational update on our businesses. In light of Neal Schmale's retirement later this year and my retirement next year, our board engaged in a thoughtful year-long process to ensure a smooth leadership succession. ", "That process culminated in the election of Debbie Reed as CEO and as a Sempra board member. As many of you know, Debbie has a broad understanding of the energy industry and has excelled in her 30-year career with the Sempra companies.", "She has demonstrated outstanding leadership at every level of responsibility. She is also well respected by key stakeholders that we interface with, including customers, regulators, elected officials community leaders and our employees. Given this, we decided that she was the right person to lead the company going forward.", "Once the decision was reached that Debbie would succeed me as CEO, we decided to make that transition effective immediately. This timing provides Debbie with the opportunity to focus on Sempra's annual strategic review of our business. Additionally, this timing allows Neal and me to provide support and guidance to Debbie and the rest of the organization during this transition until our retirements. ", "We have an excellent management team in place to take the company forward. The board and I are confident that Debbie, Mark, the business unit presidents and the rest of the management team will continue our excellent track record of creating shareholder value and delivering great service to our customers.", "Now I'd like to hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra Reed", "Thanks, Don. I'm pleased to join you all in my new role today. Before I review our second quarter results with you, I would like to address the question some of you have asked concerning my strategic vision for Sempra. ", "I want to start by reiterating that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. It is a space within our sector where we have demonstrated success and one in which we have deep competency. ", "As Don mentioned, we have just begun our annual strategic review at Sempra in which we update our 5-year business plan. This year, I have 3 objectives that we will complete as part of this process.", "First, we will conduct a thorough market assessment of the short- and long-term business environment in which we operate. We will be analyzing market trends to identify opportunities and risks. As an example, environmental regulations are prompting retirements of coal plant, at the same time that nuclear plant development has been substantially slowed. This trend is likely to create opportunities for natural gas-fired generation and the development of new gas infrastructure, including storage. ", "Secondly, we will be reviewing the current and expected performance of our asset portfolio considering market cycles and focusing on getting the greatest value from these assets. We will develop specific strategies for assets not meeting our return expectation in this market environment.", "Lastly, we will put in place the organization and leadership to execute and deliver on our plan. I feel fortunate to have Don, Neal, Mark and the rest of the management team available to draw upon and support me in this process as I transition into my new role. ", "As always, we will update you on any developments on our quarterly earnings call and at our analyst conference next spring. ", "Now let's move on to the review of our second quarter and year-to-date financial results.", "Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $511 million or $2.12 per share compared with $222 million or $0.89 per share in the same period last year. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million or $1.15 per share, reflecting the write-up in the value of the company's original investments in Chile and Peru. ", "This was a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in those utilities during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this gain, our quarterly earnings per share increased by 9%. Earnings for the first 6 months of 2011 were $769 million or $3.19 per share compared with $328 million or $1.31 per share in 2010. First quarter 2010 earnings included an after-tax charge of $96 million or $0.38 per share related to a litigation settlement.", "Our financial performance for the first half of the year is in line with our expectations for this point in the year and on a full year basis. We remain on track to generate earnings of $4 to $4.30 per share. This, of course, excludes the impact of the write-up that we recognized this quarter. ", "While our earnings in the second half of the year will be impacted by the expiration of Sempra Generation's 10-year contract with the California Department of Water Resources at the end of the third quarter, we expect higher second half earnings at our California utilities consistent with our past performance. Additionally, we are expecting the contribution from some regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved later this year.", "SDG&E will be requesting the CPUC's approval to recover a total of about $90 million of increased wildfire insurance costs from July 2010 through December of this year. About $60 million of that has already been requested, and we expect to file a request in the third quarter of this year for an additional $30 million. ", "You may recall that late last year, the commission allowed SDG&E to recover $29 million of insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period. It also provided guidance for future recovery requests until our next general rate case, and our 2 requests will be consistent with that guidance.", "The other regulatory matters that we anticipate to be resolved by the end of the year are applications for $17 million of energy efficiency awards for SDG&E and SoCalGas and a $6 million gas cost incentive mechanism award at SoCalGas. I'd note that all the items I just described are on a pretax basis.", "Now I'd like to hand it over to Mark, so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Debbie. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $71 million compared with earnings of $75 million in the year-ago quarter. The small variance was due to higher AFUDC earnings, which were more than offset by higher litigation expense and insurance premiums. ", "For the 6 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $160 million, which is in line with the $158 million of earnings last year. At Southern California Gas Co., second quarter 2011 earnings were $59 million compared with $69 million in the second quarter of 2010. ", "The second quarter of this year was impacted by $5 million from lower storage revenues and higher expenses net of higher CPUC authorized margin and a $4 million adjustment to prior year employee benefit costs.", "For the 6 months of 2011, SoCalGas' earnings were $127 million compared with $134 million of earnings last year. ", "Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $337 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $39 million in the same quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain, earnings were $60 million for the quarter, and the quarter benefited from $14 million of higher earnings from our increased ownership stake in the utilities in Chile and Peru and also from $5 million of higher earnings from the pipeline assets in Mexico, which were acquired in the second quarter of 2010.", "For the first half of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $391 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain this year, earnings were $114 million for the first half of 2011 compared with $77 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $20 million higher earnings from Chile and Peru and $13 million higher earnings from Mexican pipeline assets. ", "Now let's go to Slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $18 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $13 million in the prior year's period. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $51 million, up from $45 million last year. Both the second quarter and year-to-date 2011 results included $11 million higher earnings from customer payments related to the nondelivery of contracted cargoes. ", "Now please move to Slide 7. Our generation business recorded earnings of $50 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $52 million in the same quarter of 2010. For the first 6 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $94 million, up from $1 million of earnings last year. ", "Last year's results included an $84 million charge related to a litigation settlement in the first quarter. The improvement in earnings was also due to $15 million of lower operating and maintenance costs as a result of scheduled plant maintenance and earthquake damage to our Mexicali power plant in 2010. This was offset by $4 million higher depreciation expense this year.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 8.", "Debra Reed", "Thanks, Mark. Now let me update you on activities at our California utilities. Last month, SDG&E and SoCalGas filed updates to their general rate case applications, which reflect the impact of bonus depreciation. ", "The updates were consistent with what we had included in the guidance provided you in March. The CPUC schedule for the rate cases call for intervener testimony in September, hearings late in the year and a final CPUC decision around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making the new rates established by these rate cases retroactive to January 1, 2012. ", "Another important regulatory proceeding is the CPUC's examination of what changes should be made to natural gas pipelines following the tragedy in San Bruno. As we talked about on our last call, the CPUC requested records supporting maximum allowable operating pressures for 1,600 miles out of 4,000 miles of Department of Transportation defined transmission pipelines that SoCalGas and SDG&E operate. ", "We conducted an extensive review, which renewed our confidence that the maximum pressures on our systems have been appropriately set in accordance with current regulation, and that we operate our systems safely.", "The CPUC has also directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipelines that have not been pressure tested. We will submit our plan to the CPUC by August 26. We believe that complying with these new requirements has the potential of increasing capital spending at our utilities, particularly at SoCalGas, by several hundred million dollars per year over a 10-year period. But it will ultimately be the commission's decision to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect full recovery for all incremental costs related to complying with the new requirement. ", "Please go to Slide 9. Now let's move on to some of the major utility projects. For the $1.9 billion Sunrise Powerlink project, construction is progressing as planned. The project is on budget and is now about 30% complete. We continue to expect to complete the line in the second half of next year. ", "Turning to SDG&E Smart Meter program, this project is now essentially complete. The mass deployment phase has concluded as of the end of the second quarter over 1.3 million electric and 850,000 gas meters have been installed.", "I'd also mention that SoCalGas' advanced metering project is on track and the upgrade of 6 million natural gas meters is expected to begin next year.", "As for the push towards meeting the 33% renewables target, SDG&E has made significant progress this year. Since the beginning of the year, contracts for more than 1,200 megawatts of renewable energy have been added to its portfolio. One renewable project that I'd like to highlight is Rim Rock, which is a 189-megawatt wind project that demonstrates a unique approach to helping meet the renewable goals at SDG&E. ", "Last month, the CPUC unanimously voted to allow SDG&E to make a tax equity investment for up to $250 million in the Rim Rock project. The investment will be included in rate base and represents the first regulated tax equity structure in the nation. ", "We will also make an additional shareholder investment in the project, which is expected to be about $40 million and should earn a utility-like return. This innovative structure benefits customers by lowering costs for clean energy and serves as a model for future projects. ", "Now let's move to the next slide. Last week, we announced the expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex in Nevada. The project, creatively called Copper Mountain 2, is supported by a 25-year power sales contract with PG&E that is now pending approval by the CPUC. We expect 92 megawatts to be complete by January of 2013 and 58 megawatts by 2015.", "And at the end of the second quarter, the 250-megawatt Cedar Creek 2 wind project at Colorado was also placed in service. This project is a 50-50 joint venture with BP Wind. There is a 25-year agreement in place with a utility subsidiary of Xcel Energy for the sale of the project's power. ", "At our last analyst conference in March, we discussed plans to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity at Sempra Generation over the next 5 years. Already, half of this goal has been met with projects that have been completed and under construction or have been contracted.", "Also, out of these 500 megawatts, about 300 megawatts have already received the necessary regulatory approvals. We are developing and building a robust pipeline of renewable projects, and including in our slide presentation is an appendix summarizing these projects that we've launched today. ", "In addition to the 1,000 megawatts in our 5-year plan, we have the potential for roughly 1,700 megawatts of additional renewable projects based upon our existing land position.", "I'd also like to update you on our efforts to maximize the value of Sempra Generation's natural gas plants. We recently signed a 25-year agreement to supply 240 megawatts of electricity to an association of electric utilities in Arizona and southern Nevada. The contract, which starts in 2015, provides us with an attractive long-term strategic hedge for a significant portion of our existing generation capacity at Palo Verde and serves as a platform for further optimization of the 2 remaining gas-fired plants we will have following the transfer of El Dorado to SDG&E on October 1 of this year.", "By the way, I'd also like to share with you that I recently visited Peru and had the opportunity to meet with Peru's new president as well as the prime minister and energy minister. We had a very constructive meeting, and it gave me confidence that the positive regulatory framework our electric utility has operated under for over a decade will continue. There is great interest in ensuring that Peru has a robust electric grid and increased generation capacity to keep up with its economic growth. Now please turn to the final slide.", "We're pleased that we're on track to meet our guidance for the year, and I have confidence that our utilities will deliver strong results in the second half of this year consistent with our long track record of solid performance. The major projects at our California utilities are moving forward according to plan and our infrastructure businesses are performing well. ", "Before I open up the call to take questions, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the fact that this is Neal Schmale's final earnings call before his retirement later this year. In his prior role as Chief Financial Officer and his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer, Neal has made countless significant contributions to Sempra Energy in his 13 years with the company. I want to thank him for his leadership and dedication to our company and wish him the very best in his retirement.", "With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Faisel Khan of Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "On the power generation contract I believe you guys signed at Sempra Generation, about the 25-year contract for 240 megawatts beginning in 2015, can you guys talk about that a little bit more in terms of what the pricing outlook is for that? I know we have the contract falling off at the end of the year. What does -- what is that contract exactly -- how this is structured?", "Debra Reed", "I would just say that we're not going to disclose the commercial terms. But we feel that this is a really good starting point for hedging our fleet and we feel very positive about the contract. We think it's good for the customer and very good for our business as well.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, fair enough. And then if you could give us a little update on what -- how you guys are thinking about some of your gas infrastructure assets within the U.S., particularly your equity investment in REX and your storage assets and your LNG assets, are you guys still thinking about or do you ever look at the MLP structure and how that could enhance the value of Sempra stock or how that might help you guys grow that business a little bit further?", "Debra Reed", "Well, Faisal, I will start and then I'll ask Mark to add anything to that. As was mentioned, we're engaged right now in our strategy works that we do every year around this time. And those are the kinds of questions that we're looking at as part of the strategy work. We're looking at every asset we have and what's the best structure for that asset. Is it an asset that we can add assets to and increase the value and what is the best way to maximize the value of our existing investment? And certainly, we will look at structures like MLPs as part of that. Mark do you want to add anything?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, I would just say, we've looked at it in the past and I think we're focused on it now and I would expect that we would -- I don't know that we'll go exactly the MLP route but I do think that we'll do something to maximize the value of our assets. But that's certainly an option that's open and we're exploring it in the current market.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then, have you guys also looked at the liquefaction option at your Cameron facility? Is that still a possibility or do you -- how are you guys thinking about that?", "Debra Reed", "I would say that, that is a possibility if we can get long-term contracts from a credit worthy counterparty for that. I think Don has stated before and I would reaffirm that my view is we're not going to do that unless we can have long-term contracts in place. But certainly, that's something that we're looking at with other parties.", "Operator", "We'll go to Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "The tax rate for the second quarter seemed a bit low and I was wondering if you could sort of describe what's going on there and if there's been any change in the tax rate outlook for this year and others?", "Debra Reed", "I'm going to ask Joe Householder to answer that.", "Joseph Householder", "This is Joe. Our tax rate is right in line with what Mark presented at the analyst conference, roughly about 30% for 2011. The low rate you're seeing in the statement of operations is simply due to the noncash book gain we had on the step-up of our basis of the preexisting Chile/Peru equity investment, so that's why it's 17% and 25% or so. But we're really at the 30% rate if you take that gain out.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. And then, you guys have thought about a buyback and with the falloff in the share price and what have you, I was wondering if you guys might want to sort of talk about what your current thinking on that might be or how you're looking at that in relation to some of the activity we've seen in the market in your stock?", "Debra Reed", "I'm going to ask Mark to address that. We've had a number of discussions, so.", "Mark Snell", "Well, certainly, we think our stock is an excellent investment right now. But I do think -- we are still looking at where we come out at SoCalGas with the increased capital spending that we fully expect to have to pay or to have to invest for the next couple of years, and as we've said, it's probably to the tune of several hundred millions of dollars a year for a multi-year period. And so once we know what those numbers are, then we can think about whether there's room to do any kind of buyback or anything like that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "So we're probably talking in terms of timing still a ways off, is that how we should think about it?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, I would think we wouldn't make any decisions until the fourth quarter.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then the pipeline analysis, it sounds like you guys have done a thorough analysis and you're okay with the pressure. Another company in California has had quite a few things come out, I guess, as part of their review in terms of past practices and other issues perhaps not directly related to pressure. Can you guys tell us if there's anything potentially like that, that you guys are seeing or any revelations that you guys have had about your -- with your safety review that might be noteworthy?", "Debra Reed", "I will just say that we have had people doing thorough reviews because we've had the same reporting requirements to the CPUC as other companies in California have had, and that we have not found anything that concerns us in terms of our past practices or how we operate our pipelines. We operate our system very safely. We have looked at lessons learned from the San Bruno incident and are making modifications going forward that we think would improve our responsiveness if something like that occurred. But we have not found any deep concerns at all in terms of the way we've operated our system. And we just had a recent audit of this by the CPUC and they didn't find any concerns either that's significant.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett of Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc.", "Couple of just real quick questions. With the tax equity investment alongside just the normal equity investment in -- was it Rock Rim, sorry, are you considering doing that maybe outside of just wind or I mean, is there like a sort of a targeted technology? I mean maybe you might be considering geothermal investments as well or perhaps solar?", "Debra Reed", "What we've looked at thus far is most of the projects we focused in on have been on the wind side, but it wouldn't preclude doing other technologies. I would stress that this investment is being done within SDG&E, within the regulated company, and so the big issue there is ensuring that the entire structure is a benefit for customers as well. So if there was a competitive solar deal that could be structured in the same way and provide benefits to customers, we would certainly consider that.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc.", "Would you be considering kind of the same set up where the tax equity investment alongside the equity?", "Debra Reed", "Yes, on the geothermal, I don't think that, that would -- we would be looking at that. But in this case, this was a regulatory structure that was negotiated as part of a settlement. And that the CPUC basically had the structure approved where we would have the rate based investment and then we would have a shareholder investment alongside of that. So my sense is that, that would be the type of structure that they would want us to have going forward.", "Mark Snell", "Mark, this is Mark Snell. The one thing on that would be is the tax equity helped us get a lower cost to customers because it lowered the financing cost for the developer and any of those. And that would be -- that same structure could work very well with a solar development, as well as wind. Anything that has a high tax component to it, we think it could be effective and literally -- I mean, it is one of the few times where it is sort of a win-win for everybody. We get lower pricing for customers, the developer gets -- has lower cost and we get a tax benefit at the utility that's shared with the shareholders. So all of that kind of works out well.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc.", "Okay. And then just one more quick question on the PEMEX assets, has there been any further discussion around those remaining kind of assets in the JV? Or is it just going to sit pat for now?", "Debra Reed", "Well, as far as the PEMEX assets, right now, we're working with PEMEX on some potential growth projects. There has been no additional movement in terms of them exiting the partnership. But as long as we remain in the partnership, we believe that there will be a number of growth projects that we could do jointly. So that's where that stands at this time.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Just wanted to check in, where do we stand on distributions from the sale of the commodity business, could you just help us where we are in that? Have you gotten everything or just still -- how much more is there to go?", "Debra Reed", "Well, we've gotten about -- we expect to get between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. We've gotten a little over $1.4 billion, and we would expect to get the remaining $400 million to $450 million by the first quarter of next year. And we did get about $320 million in April of this year as a distribution.", "Mark Snell", "Yes, and we're kind of on a quarterly distribution schedule. We should get another $100 million here in a week or so.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "And Debbie, as you guys go through the strategic review, I guess, one thing as we've gone through the sale of the commodity business to make it more simple and all that, it's still -- I don't know we're still not getting the multiple, and I don't know, is there some way you're thinking how to simplify it to the investor base, so the I guess, the different components of the businesses get their multiples reflected into the price? I'm trying to see which way you are thinking about strategically as you think over the fall.", "Debra Reed", "Yes, I would say that, that is one thing that we will be looking at. We'll be looking at all of our businesses and the long-term value of those businesses in our portfolio. We will also be looking at how do we focus on increasing some of our domestic earnings growth. And so those will be things that will be part of the strategy work. And since -- and I've just been in this job a month, I can't tell you much more than that, but we will be doing that work over the next few months.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Your Latin American businesses, can you talk to us -- I think one of the times we were out there meeting with you guys, your -- George had discussed and I think in the follow-on, you all had about significant potential growth opportunities around your Peruvian and your business in Chile. Can you just talk about whether those growth opportunities are adding bolt-on distribution businesses or are they branching out in other things like hydro or electric transmission?", "Debra Reed", "Yes, I'd be happy to talk about that. As I mentioned, I was down meeting with the new president, the energy minister and the prime minister, and they are very interested in seeing that more electric generation gets built. And in Peru, we are working right now on our first hydro project, that will be about 100-megawatt project to be completed over the next couple of years. That project will then give us an opportunity to do more. But I want to stress just in our basic distribution area, kind of our basic growth in our Chilean and Peruvian businesses so you get a good sense of that. If you look at the customer growth that we're seeing in those businesses, it's about 2.5% a year. If you look at the sales growth in those businesses, it's about 5.5% to 7% per year. And we are interested, and if there are some potential distribution companies that could be consolidated and we feel that they would be wise investments for us, we would certainly consider those investments as well. It does have a very high growth environment and have a very stable regulatory environment, which we believe will continue.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. And one follow-up. Can you talk about the capitalization of the business and if growth opportunities don't emerge, whether there's a potential to recapitalize that business and eventually to bring back some incremental capital back to the U.S. or use it for like investment in Mexico or elsewhere?", "Debra Reed", "Yes, there is some opportunities, and I'll have Mark go through the details of that.", "Mark Snell", "Of course, all of the expansion projects and even the acquisitions that we could possibly do in South America would all be funded at the local level down there. We have additional borrowing capacity at that level, and we also have offshore cash that we could use to invest there. So we wouldn't anticipate funding from the U.S. to grow those businesses. We would anticipate doing that there locally. And then obviously, we, like a lot of other companies in the U.S., are lobbying and talking about some kind of change in the tax system that would allow U.S. companies to bring cash home and invest in opportunities here. And we certainly are poised and ready to take advantage of that if that should happen. But we have in our models also anticipated that even if it didn't happen, at some point in development we will have enough cash, we will have to bring some of it home. And of course, we have to pay the taxes on that. But we think the right answer right now is since we have good investment opportunities is to continue to invest that money offshore.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "How sizable is that? Meaning like if you were to make the decision to bring back some of the capital today, what are we talking about?", "Mark Snell", "Well, in our 5-year plan, we'd build up about $1 billion of offshore cash over the 5-year planning period.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take a follow-up from Faisel Khan.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Sorry, guys, just a couple more questions. I think there's talk of this brass LNG project maybe moving forward, and I think you guys might have a small stake in that project. Are you still interested in participating in that project? Or is that something that you have to review?", "Debra Reed", "I would say that we're looking at all opportunities in terms of that, and I'm going to ask Neal to put some color around it.", "Neal Schmale", "Yes, this is Neal Schmale. And we did have an interest in acquiring a small stake in that project, emphasize the word small, and the project like all of these takes a long time to get going. But I think the general idea is that to acquire molecules of LNG internationally will allow us to improve that business.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, understood. And then on the SoCalGas side, you guys talked about kind of lower storage revenues. Can you highlight that a little bit more or go into that a little more? What causes those storage revenues to be lower? I thought that was mostly a regulated business, but I guess there's a little bit of industrial and power generation load that affects that number?", "Debra Reed", "Yes, it is a regulated business and on the storage piece, so we have an incentive design that allows us to make some additional money by selling storage at a premium to some of the market pricing and packaging storage in creative ways. And we've earned incentive historically, earned some incentives this year for that, but the incentives were less this year than we've had in the prior year. That's all that's happening there. And there was a couple of million dollars on a pretax basis and nothing real significant.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then just, is your Sunrise, when I look at the CapEx for the first 6 months and is it possible to break out kind of what Sunrise and the Smart Meter programs was, because these are very distinct projects that will -- that have come to a close or will come to a close in the near future, so that represents kind of a ramp down I guess CapEx although I think some of your other...", "Debra Reed", "Yes, for Sunrise, the number was $347 million for the first 6 months of the year. And then for the Smart Meter CapEx, we were looking at a total this year of about $120 million for the entire year, and I don't have the number in front of me for the first 6 months. But it's pretty much -- it's in that range.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn it back over to Ms. Reed for closing remarks.", "Debra Reed", "Well, thank you for all joining us today. We really appreciate you being with us this morning. And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call Steve Davis, Victor or Scott with any follow-up. Thank you again. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steven D. Davis", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2011 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bruce Folkmann, Acting Controller. ", "You'll note that Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

It's important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. With that, I'll turn it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. On today's call, we'll start with a review of our financial results. I'll then give you an operational update on our businesses. ", "Before we begin, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge that 2 of the long-standing members of our leadership team are joining us today in new roles. As part of our ongoing succession planning process, Mark Snell was named President of Sempra Energy. Joe Householder, who had previously served as our Senior Vice President and Controller, was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Energy, the role that Mark had held since 2005. ", "In addition, on January 1, Jeff Martin will assume a broader role as the head of U.S. Gas & Power, and George Liparidis will take over all of our international operation. I will discuss more about these changes later. ", "I think we have a great team in place, one that has worked well together for many years and one that is ready to build on our success and take the company forward. So now let's discuss our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, beginning on Slide 3.", "Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $296 million or $1.22 per share compared with $131 million or $0.53 per share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $270 million, which excludes a $130 million write-down of our investment at RBS Sempra Commodities. Earnings for the first 9 months of 2011 were $1.1 billion or $4.40 per share compared with $459 million or $1.84 per share in 2010. This year's second quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million reflecting the write-up and the value of our investments in Chile and Peru. And in 2010, earnings included an after-tax litigation charge of $96 million, as well as the write-down of the investment in RBS Sempra Commodities that I just mentioned.", "On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the first 9 months of 2011 were up 17% compared to last year, and I'm pleased with the strong performance from all of our businesses. ", "Now I'd like to hand it over to Joe, so he can take you through some of the details of our financial results beginning with Slide 4.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $113 million compared with earnings of $106 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings from work-in progress or AFUDC equity mainly from the Sunrise Powerlink project. ", "For the first 9 months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $273 million compared with $264 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the higher AFUDC earnings net of increased interest costs. ", "At Southern California Gas, third quarter 2011 earnings were $81 million compared with $78 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the first 9 months of 2011, SoCalGas's earnings were $208 million compared with $212 million last year. Now let's go to Slide 5.", "Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $66 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily due to $11 million higher earnings from the accretive acquisition we made in Chile and Peru and $18 million higher earnings from non-operating foreign currency effects in Chile. Partially offsetting this was a net $7 million benefit last year due to nonrecurring items related to our investment in Argentina.", "For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage had earnings of $457 million. Excluding the impact of the $277 million gain earlier this year, earnings were $180 million for the first 9 months of 2011 compared with earnings of $120 million last year. The increase was mainly due to $31 million higher earnings from operations in Chile and Peru, $13 million higher earnings from the Mexican pipeline operations we acquired in April 2010 and $15 million from the foreign currency benefit in Chile that I just mentioned.", "I\u2019d note, the currency gain in Chile resulted primarily from having over $200 million in U.S. currency at Chilquinta while there was a strengthening of the dollar relative to the Chilean peso. Some of the gain will turn around in the fourth quarter because the dollar has since weakened. ", "The cash has now been distributed out of the operating company. And because we no longer plan to retain excess funds in excess of operating needs at Chilquinta, we do not expect to see this as a significant item in future years.", "Now please go to slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $24 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $5 million in the prior year's period. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra LNG's earnings were $75 million, up from $50 million last year. The increase in earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date was due primarily to higher revenues for contracted cargoes that were not delivered. Now please move to Slide 7.", "Our Generation business recorded earnings of $49 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $59 million in the same quarter in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from natural gas fired power plant operations, was partially offset by an income tax benefit. For the first 9 months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $143 million, up from $60 million last year. Last year's results included an $86 million charge related to a litigation settlement. ", "I also want to mention that as anticipated, Generation's 10-year contract to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources expired at the end of the third quarter. This contract anchored our fleet of gas plants for the past 10 years. Also, on October 1, the 480-megawatt El Dorado gas plant was acquired by SDG&E for its book value about $200 million, and now it will earn a rate base return at SDG&E.", "Now let's move to the next slide. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, there is a regulatory item that I'd like to point out as it relates to our expectations for the remainder of the year. SDG&E has requested the CPUC's approval to recover increased wildfire insurance costs for the period July 2010, through December of this year, which if approved as filed will result in about $50 million of earnings. You may recall that late last year, the Commission allowed SDG&E to recover its higher insurance costs for the July 2009 to June 2010 policy period, which resulted in the recognition of $16 million of earnings. It also provided guidance for the future recovery request until our next rate case, and our 2 requests are consistent with that guidance. The amount and the timing of recovery of these requests will play a key role in determining where, within our guidance range, we end the year.", "Given our outlook for the remainder of the year and the strong performance across all of our businesses for the first 9 months, we are on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share, this excludes the impact of the remeasurement gain from our South American acquisition that we recognized in the second quarter.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 9.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Now let me update you in activities in our California utility. In our general rate cases for SDG&E and SoCalGas, the interveners in the proceedings filed their testimony in September, and we filed our rebuttal testimony last month, which sets the stage for settlement discussion. The proceedings schedules call for hearings in December and final CPUC decisions around March of 2012. The CPUC has already approved making these new rates retroactive to January 1, 2012.", "Turning to the Sunrise Powerlink project at SDG&E. The project now is about 50% complete and remains on budget. We continue to expect the lines to be completed in the second half of 2012. Earlier this year, the CPUC directed the natural gas utilities in California to file implementation plans to comply with new requirements to test or replace all transmission pipeline that have not been pressure tested. We submitted our pipeline safety enhancement plan to the CPUC in late August. This plan calls for spending a total of $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, primarily at SoCalGas. ", "We have requested cost recovery for the first phase, which entails spending $1.4 billion of capital and about $300 million of O&M expense through 2015 to pressure test or replace pipeline in the highest priority areas. ", "Both SoCalGas and SDG&E expect the CPUC to allow recovery for all costs associated with complying with these new requirement and to set the appropriate level of spending going forward. Now please go to Slide 10.", "Given the dramatic rise in North American natural gas production from shale resources and the disparity in natural gas prices between North America and both Asian and European market, several liquefaction projects have now been proposed that would export LNG to international markets. ", "We have strong interest from large credit-worthy counterparties who want to procure liquefaction services from Cameron LNG on long-term, 20-plus-year contracts. Due to the significant interest, we will be submitting an application for an LNG export license from the Department of Energy in the very near future. Our goal is to get a long-term contract, fully utilize our existing infrastructure and minimize our future investment risk. Given the stature and enthusiasm of the interested parties, we believe this is a realistic objective. ", "Now before I move on to the final slide, I'd like to provide an update on our strategic planning process. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, this is an exercise that we undertake each year to update our 5-year business plan. You may recall that I outlined 3 primary objectives as part of this year's effort, which are: to conduct a thorough market assessment, to identify opportunities and risks; review the current and expected performance of our asset portfolio with the goal of getting the greatest value from these assets; and put in place the organization and leadership to execute and deliver on our plans. ", "We recently announced management changes and a business unit realignment, which is an initial step in the evolution of our business. I want to stress that our strategy has been and will continue to be focused on regulated utilities and contracted energy infrastructure. ", "Our realignment reflects this continued focus. The leaders of our 2 California utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas now report directly to me. In his new role as President, Mark Snell will oversee our operations outside the California utilities. Effective at the beginning of next year, Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage and Sempra LNG, will be consolidated into 2 new business units reporting to Mark: Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power. ", "With regard to our market assessment and portfolio review, our work is ongoing and we plan to detail the results at our analyst conference next spring. Now please turn to the final slide.", "To summarize, I'm very pleased with the strong performance across all of our business units, so far this year. Our adjusted earnings for the first 9 months of the year are up 17% from last year, and we're on track to meet our earnings outlook for 2011.", "With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Debbie, 2 questions. One, I know you're in the early stages of kind of taking a strategic look at the various assets. Where do you think you have scale? And maybe more importantly, where do you think you lack scale?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, certainly, Michael, I would say that we have scale in our utility operations both internationally and in the U.S. and those are clearly profitable businesses for us. I think that in our U.S. Gas & Power business, this is an area where we want to focus in looking at those assets and how those assets can be utilized in more fully in some cases and in different ways in other cases to grow that U.S. Gas & Power business. And Mark Snell and his team will be involved in doing that.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The other question and this thinking about the balance sheet over the coming years, are you guys, thinking about in terms of dividend growth versus share buyback, versus funding CapEx, versus even potential debt reduction or minimizing debt issuances at the holding company level?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, Michael, I'm going to ask Joe to shine some light on that further, but let me just say that, that is part of our overall strategic review. And we, fortunately, are in a position where we have a lot of good investments mainly in our utilities. And so we want to make those investments in our utilities, and we'll be looking at that as a top priority. And then we will be looking at the dividend that always occurs in our February board meeting where our board looks at that. So let me just hand it over to Joe and see if he wants to shine any more color on that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Sure. I think, Michael, I'd just stay with what Debbie was saying is part of the strategic review is to look at capital allocation. And that question that you asked is simply around capital allocation. How are we going to look at dividend? We have a policy now we'll continue to look at that with the board, and we will maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings. That's important to us, so that's something we will focus on, and we'll look at the great investment opportunities we have and decide upon the capital allocation and whether that includes more capital to the utilities or U.S. Gas & Power business or more to dividend or more to share buyback. We're going to look at that in this process. We'll be talking about that when we meet in March.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson", "The income tax benefit and generation, could you quantify that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Joe, you want to?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Sure. I'm going to ask Bruce Folkmann to give you the details of that. But it was a component of a Mexican tax benefits, and obviously, we have some solar credits that we're recognizing.", "Bruce Folkmann", "This is Bruce Folkmann. The Mexican tax benefit is the primary is driver for the change in rate. And let me just explain that. It affected generation and it also touches on our other operations in Mexico. Many of those subsidiaries use the U.S. dollars as their functional currency. So during the third quarter the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Mexican peso. As a result, U.S. dollar denominated liabilities, generally debt, resulted in Mexican tax benefits. This lowered the tax rate for our Mexican operations and for Sempra. We have economically hedged this exposure in 2011, but the impact of the hedge isn't reflected in tax expenses, it's reflected in other income and expense. Another impact of the weakening peso is that our deferred tax liabilities was declined in U.S. dollar terms resulting in lower tax rates. Again, lower tax rates for Mexican operations and for Sempra.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And how much was this?", "Bruce Folkmann", "The impact on generation?", "Paul Patterson", "Yes.", "Bruce Folkmann", "Well, it really drove the rate from 25% to 20% or a negative 20% rather, of benefit.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. So I mean, just a dollar number? Do we have that? Or I can circle back after the call if that's easier.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, we have it.", "Bruce Folkmann", "We have it.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Just one second. It's, I believe, it's about $7 million in generation.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. Great. And then the gas pipeline plan? As I\u2019m sure you guys know PG&E had quite an announcement this morning. And I was wondering whether or not you could just sort of comment on how -- obviously, it's a different situation different -- if you could just maybe comment a little bit about the pipeline safety enhancement plan and how that differs. I mean, it sounds like you're planning on getting full recovery. Just if you could elaborate a little more on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure, very much so. I think we are in a different situation clearly in that regard. As I told you the filing that we made is really for new activities that the CPUC is requiring of the utilities as a result of the PG&E situation. And so they are requiring us to test all lines that haven't been tested, and that was not previously required under the regulation. So we made a filing consistent with the CPUC's request. We would anticipate that they would authorize a memorandum account for us so that we can begin recovering costs or begin booking the costs to the memorandum account within the first quarter of next year. And as I mentioned, our total filing over 10 years is $3.1 billion, $2.8 million of that is capital. And then our 5-year request for funding, which we have requested to occur prior to the next rate case, is about $1.4 billion in capital, and we fully expect to recover that.", "Paul Patterson", "And then on the liquefaction, just if you could, how much are we talking about? I mean that's usually a lot more expensive than the LNG terminal stuff. I know you guys already have some stuff in place and what-have-you. But could you give us a feeling for what you're thinking about here and sort of what the next steps might be in terms of when we might get a better picture as to what may or may not happen? And so the time frame, if anything does happen, when that would be?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Let me just give a high level, and then I'll have Mark give a little bit more color. We're in discussions with very strong counterparties about making this conversion, but those discussions are still at pretty early stages. And so we don't have a specific structure identified. What we do have identified is that we would only do this if we had a long-term contract, and we would not build something that we couldn't have fully contracted. And in doing this, we would really look at the rest of the investment and structure. And we have not taken commodity risks and wouldn't intend to in anything that you would do. So those are kind of the key things from our side that we're looking at in terms of any deal structure. And Mark, do you want to comment?", "Mark A. Snell", "Paul, I just would say this, look, it's pretty early stage. But the good news here is that we have a real opportunity to take the Cameron facility and start utilizing it to its maximum potential, and I think that's really the exciting news. And then beyond that, how we structure it, whether we do this on our own or in partners, we have very sophisticated large counterparties that we're talking with here that essentially would become our partners in this. And so at the end of the day, we haven't really spelled out in ourselves here internally how we would fund this. But it wouldn't necessarily be our capital that we would put at work. I mean, there's lots of opportunities to do different things. I think you should just look at this as a very, very real and very positive upside to a business that's just coming into its own right now.", "Paul Patterson", "I guess I'm sort of wondering, though, I mean just can you throw out sort of a ballpark number, what a facility like this would cost, given where you -- with the infrastructure you already have in place? I mean, it may not be all your capital and stuff but just in general, I\u2019m wondering.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. It could be anywhere from $1 billion to a couple of billion dollars. It depends on the size of the facility and what's optimal for the people that we're dealing with, what they want. And so it's really -- we really -- it's pretty wide parameters right now because we don't know how big of a facility that's going to be required or be desired. So we're kind of looking at all those options, and we'll keep you updated. This is a longer-term process because as the DOE has recently announced they're going to review the export permits carefully and so this could take some bit of time before this comes to realization but we should be able to know sometime in the next year whether -- how this will move forward and we'll give you more detail as we know them.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. Great. And then just finally, the RBS wind down. Are we pretty much set for the rest of the year, I think you guys are about, a little over $300 million there now? Do you expect to get all that by the end year or any thoughts on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We're on track with what we've told you before, a little bit over $300 million that we would expect to recover. Some of that may come in to the first quarter of next year but we would get the majority of it this year.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And that $7 million gain that we talked about for the income tax thing, is that going to be an ongoing thing or is that sort of just the quarterly impact with all the stuff you're talking about with the Mexican U.S. debt thing?", "Debra L. Reed", "Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "This is Joe. That can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter because of the difference between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar but the thing is, this is a non-cash adjustment to the deferred tax liability, because that's in pesos and we have a dollar function of currency. So it moves around. It goes up and down. It usually isn't quite as dramatic as it was this past quarter because the peso really devalued against the dollar quite a bit in the quarter itself, mostly written in the last couple of weeks of the month as we're dealing with the Greek crisis and all that. But I don't expect it to be a significant number from quarter-to-quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich", "Can you refresh my memory on your cost of capital mechanism? Do you have that sort of dead band range that annually gets tested to see if it triggers cost of capital change?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, Leslie, we do at both utilities and they\u2019re different mechanisms at each of the 2 utilities. The SoCalGas mechanism is based upon the 30-year treasury, and the SDG&E mechanism is based upon the utility bond index. And so when we look at those mechanisms, that we do not expect either of them to trigger so we would expect to keep the same cost of capital until we get into our next proceeding. SoCalGas is a little closer than SDG&E is in terms of where we are on the triggering mechanism. But the 30-year treasury would have to fall below 2.81% for the remainder of this year in order for that to trigger and since it's been over 3%, it's 3.11% today, we would not anticipate a trigger.", "Leslie Rich", "So is that the kind of thing that's tested sort of once a year? Or is that up for potential adjustment?", "Debra L. Reed", "It's tested once a year, but the last testing until the cost of capital will be for SoCal at the end of this year and SDG&E test period is earlier and they've already cleared the test period. So basically, unless the utilities bond -- unless the 30-year treasury rate goes below 2.81% for the remainder of this year, there will be no triggering at either utility.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett from MorningStar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Quick question. You may have already gone over this briefly, but I think I might have missed. The timeline on the review process for your submitted PSEP program. When you might [indiscernible] first year back\u2026", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The timeline for the review, we're anticipating that a memorandum account will be established in the first quarter of next year. And the memorandum account would allow us to book costs for future recovery. And then the proceeding is unclear to us exactly what the timing of the full proceeding would be for the approval of the entire filing. But once we have a memorandum account then we can begin implementation.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And with the final, I guess, proposal or accepted proposal, are you expecting it to just take the form of a writer or...", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm not sure I quite understood.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Like an ongoing writer mechanism?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. What we filed for is a surcharge, and that, that surcharge would stay in place until our next rate case. And then on our next rate case, they would look at the future periods and put into our next rate case an amount to continue with us -- through $3.1 billion over the next 10 years that we've requested. So we broke it into 2 pieces. The first piece is $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion of that is capital, and we would look at that, getting the memo account to begin that in the first quarter of next year. And then the second piece would occur after the rate case period.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And just one more quick question. With the LNG export the impact on your existing import capability, would there be any, just in terms of physical space or how might that work?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, as you probably know, Cameron is about 1/3 contracted and so the facility has capacity to add the liquefaction and keep the gasification plant in operation. So we would envision that we would be able to do both of that facility.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan from Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "On the Eldorado plant that gets dropped into SDG&E, do we see an immediate sort of true up in earnings as that plan has dropped in?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, it goes into rate base immediately, and that was under a separate proceeding so there should be a true up in earnings for that plant because it was not part of the GRC. It was incremental to the GRC. It was transferred in the beginning of October at an amount of a little over $200 million.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got you. And then on the $3.1 billion sort of capital plan for pipeline integrity and I guess replacement at SoCalGas, do you envision that being kind of front-end loaded or is that going to be kind of equally amortized over a 10-year period?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, as I mentioned, over the first 5 years, we're requesting $1.7 billion out of the $3.1 billion. So it's a little bit front-end loaded. But out of that $1.7 billion, we're estimating about $1.4 billion of that being capital, and the most of that is SoCalGas.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. I guess, if I'm just looking at your earnings from the, I guess, Gas Pipeline & Storage business that you guys have right now, how much of that earnings is -- or Pipeline Storage business, how much of that earnings is from kind of foreign entities? What percentage, if you can give me an idea?", "Debra L. Reed", "I think, yes, I know that 60% of that is really coming from our utilities, and that includes our utilities in Chile and Peru. I don't have a precise percentage of what, or how much is foreign but I would say it's probably pretty close to that 60%.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then on the LNG side in terms of the earnings that we're seeing from the LNG segment, is almost all of that coming from Costa Azul or is there a little bit of contribution from Cameron?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, there is some contribution for Cameron from the Eni contract that we have but the bulk of that is Costa Azul, where we have the plant fully contracted and the contracts provide for if there's a lack of delivery of cargoes of B2B paid, so...", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just on your statement of operations by business unit and that table that you guys provide, I was wondering if you can just clarify just a few line items, I guess, in your consolidated adjustments to Parent & Other you've got a $32 million, I guess, loss in the other segment, I guess, income -- sorry, it's Other Income expenses of $32 million.", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. Can you -- Faisel you're kind of fading out. Can you repeat that question? I'm sorry.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, sure. In Table F in your release you guys talked about a -- there's a $32 million expense under Parent & Other. It's I guess in the Other income and expense net. I'm just trying to figure out what that is. It's a big number year-over-year, and it is also another -- this is a large income tax item too. So I just want to understand what those movements are.", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. Joe? I'm going to have Joe handle the details on that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, Faisel. As Bruce was mentioning earlier on the Mexican tax issue, we have the FX and inflation effect on monetary assets in Mexico and we hedged that so that we don't have cash flow and earnings fluctuations from that but the hedge is at the Parent so there is a hedge loss in that $32 million number and the income tax benefit is the Mexican tax benefit that is offsetting that down in there. So that's what's going on. I don\u2019t know if we give the actual -- if you have the actual number.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That\u2019s the main driver. Okay, that actually makes sense. Okay, I appreciate that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, that's what's happening there. The other thing I'd mentioned in that column is that in the $17 million right above the $32 million, we have a small adjustment to our net book value in the RBS Sempra Commodities, which resulted in about a $10 million after-tax impairment there. So that's what that $17 million is.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. And SDG&E, the earnings attributable to non-controlling interest, that negative $21 million. It's a very large change over the last years; I was just trying to know what that is, too.", "Joseph A. Householder", "It's from the Calpine Otay Mesa plant that we have to consolidate.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So it's a variable interest rate entity or something, right?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, that's right.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. That's right.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Winfried Fruehauf from W. Fruehauf Consulting Limited.", "Winfried Fruehauf - Fruehauf consulting", "Regarding the termination of the contract with the California DWR, what is the estimated annual loss in earnings resulting from that termination of the contract?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, Winfried, as you know the contract expired on the 30th of September. And I would say that the impact of that was fully considered in our guidance that we gave you, that when we gave you the guidance and Jeff went through all of this at the analyst meeting, that impact was fully considered in our guidance, and we don't disclose details on specific contracts. But I would say that there's been some positive things happened since that time, including us contracting with spur for 240 megawatts, and we just are seeing some increased value of those assets. So I think if you look at our guidance, you can pretty well determine what we're anticipating there.", "Winfried Fruehauf - Fruehauf consulting", "And have you any other plans to mitigate the impact of the loss of earnings from that contract with the California DWR?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we do. And I'll have Mark talk about some of the things we're doing. But certainly one of the things I want to stress is that we are really ahead of our plan on renewables. We had planned to add another 1,000 megawatts, over the 5-year period. We're more than halfway there already. So those are the kinds of things that, and Mark you want to?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. Look, I think we've already done that. We've taken a couple of steps already. One, we've signed some long-term contracts, as Debbie mentioned, with other counterparties that are going to start in the next couple of years. And they're fairly good-sized. The other thing we did, of course was we did, as part of the DWR contract litigation settlement, agreed to transfer El Dorado into the utility at base. So we're really -- we're down -- we have 2 plants that were in the market marketing and taking a look at what we can do to enhance our value. And we're making some real progress on that and then, also as a part of the strategic review, we continue to evaluate the progress that we're making on that against what we could sell those plats for in the market. So I think we're always sort of open to doing whatever we think is in our shareholders' best interest.", "Debra L. Reed", "Before we go on to the next question, I'd like to clarify or modify an answer that we gave earlier. When we were looking at the percentage of foreign earnings coming out of our Pipelines & Storage business, we talked about 60% coming from our key utilities, and that is correct. The part that we didn't include is all of our Mexico operations, and so the percentage of the Pipeline & Storage earnings that are foreign is about 90%.", "Winfried Fruehauf - Fruehauf consulting", "I have one more question, if I may, and relates to the decrease in earnings from your natural gas fired generation plants, what caused those lower earnings?", "Debra L. Reed", "Mark?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, the one was the tax thing that Joe had talked about already. And then the other was we did -- last year, we had about $6 million of mark-to-market gains in the amount and this year we had about a $5 million mark-to-market loss and so than net change of $11 million makes up really most of the difference.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And the TDM plant, this is Joe, Winfried. The TDM plant was down because of a fire for part of the period.", "Mark A. Snell", "Right.", "Winfried Fruehauf - Fruehauf consulting", "Okay. And are you expecting any insurance compensation for the outage?", "Mark A. Snell", "I don't think it was out long -- enough days to collect on the insurance, but there might be some small recovery.", "Winfried Fruehauf - Fruehauf consulting", "So other than this fire, there were no operational reasons that contributed to the lower earnings?", "Mark A. Snell", "No. No, there's no operational reasons but the market for power was lower in the period than it was in the year-ago period, too.", "Winfried Fruehauf - Fruehauf consulting", "So notwithstanding favorable natural gas cost, that advantage was wiped out either in whole or in part by lower electricity prices?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, yes. I mean, I guess when you're in the generation business and you have very efficient plants, favorable natural gas prices don't always help you, right. Because a lot of times that is -- as you have lower gas prices, that tends to lower your advantage.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige from Ticonderoga.", "Kit Konolige - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "I think, Debbie, you mentioned in the GRC that the filing, so far, I think you set the stage now for settlement discussions. Can you discuss any, say, a likelihood that it will reach a settlement? And if it does, what the timing on the settlement might be?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, once all the parties have filed their testimony as has now been done, then this is the time when we can begin some settlement discussions. And I cannot comment on settlement discussions because they're confidential, but I can tell you that we have settled all of our last several rate cases, and we think that in terms of what our past practice has been, that we would very much like to work with the parties and see if we can settle this rate case as well. But we're pleased -- also if we need to go to litigation on it, we can go to litigation because we think we have a very strong case. So we'll see if we can reach settlement. We've had a history of doing that. But if we can't, we are prepared to go into hearings in December.", "Kit Konolige - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "And would they -- if there were to be a settlement based on your history, when might that occur relative to, say, the December hearings or the March kind of litigated decision timeline?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, that's hard to call because we've had some settlements that occurred before the hearings began, some settlement that occurred during the course of hearings and some settlements after the hearings when the case was wrapped up. So I would say sometime during the next 6 months would be likely. But to call it beyond that, I wouldn't be able to.", "Kit Konolige - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "All right. One separate area, if I could. You talked about the pipeline safety initiative and the higher spending that might be involved there. At what point do you get concerned that the level of CapEx for that kind of program, in addition to the other spend you're doing at the utilities, starts to imply rate increases that get difficult to see implemented, so that such that you can earn the allowed return?", "Debra L. Reed", "Let me address that because I think that the thing that is fortunate for us is that SoCalGas has some of the lowest bills in the country. Our average gas bills are $40 to $50 on an annual average basis. So we have very, very low gas bills. And so I think that because of the focus on safety and because of the need to make these kinds of investments in the system, I think there is room in those bills to accommodate this kind of a expenditures and because we start with very low bills.", "Kit Konolige - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "Fair enough. And does the gas initiative apply to SDG&E as well?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, it does apply to SDG&E. But as I said, most of the dollars are on the SoCalGas side. Over the next 5 years, we're only requesting about $200 million on the SDG&E capital side. And the $3.1 billion includes both utilities.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Sigal from Canaccord Genuity.", "Mark Sigal - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Could you provide an update on the timeline on your smart metering project at SoCalGas? And then also has the introduction of an opt out clause or an opt out option on some of the electric meter -- AMI projects going on right now had any impact on your planning or the scale of your gas project?", "Debra L. Reed", "On the SoCalGas side, we will start with -- we're doing all the IT work, the systems work right now for the AMI rollout, and we will start putting meters in at the end of next year beginning of 2013, and we will go through 2017 with our installations. As far as the opt out, it's interesting, we haven't had, on the SDG&E side, a big desire by customers to opt out. We've had basically virtually no complaints on our smart meter program at SDG&E. But I would say that what we did is upfront we spent a lot of time acquainting customers with the system, what the advantages are, how to opt -- how to use this to their benefit. And so I think that we would be doing the same types of things at SoCalGas. And on the SDG&E side, we're nearly finished. We're at about 98% completion right now. And I think our total complaints were like 0.16% of customers. So I mean, it's nothing. So I think we had good experience at SDG&E, we will apply that experience to SoCal.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Vedula Murti from CDP Capital.", "Vedula Murti - Tribeca Global Management", "I'm wondering in terms of if there was ultimately going to be some tax changes in terms of foreign repatriation and that type of thing, can you quantify, like in aggregate, like what type of investment dollars or income that had the ability or cash that you have that is offshore right now that might be able to be repatriated back into the United States at some point in time that can either help fund the capital program or any other types of entries you might choose?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, this is something that we are very much on top of. We have been involved in trying to work on a territorial tax system for the reasons that you say. Because over time, we do produce a lot of cash offshore that we would like to be able to bring back. So I'll have go Joe through the particulars of how that builds up over time.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Vedula, we support, as Debbie said, either a territorial system or lowering the corporate tax rate in the U.S. or both, and we're very encouraged by the dialogue that's happening now and the recent draft legislation from the House Ways and Means Committee. You asked a question about what we would do if there were sort of a temporary bill, a tax holiday if you will, and we're prepared. We have plans in place and we're prepared to lever up all 3 of the businesses, where we have operations, and we're fairly low debt levels in each of those 3 countries. But recall also that we have very attractive growth opportunities in each of those 3 countries. So we do have opportunity to spend the money there. But I think if we have the chance of repatriating some money, we probably would -- probably lever up and bring back at least $1 billion.", "Vedula Murti - Tribeca Global Management", "Okay. And that would be, so $1 billion you'd be able to come back to United States to help fund the utility capital program or the other U.S. [indiscernible] or businesses?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Money\u2019s fungible so it\u2019d go for our whole capital program, wherever that may be or other resource needs that we have.", "Vedula Murti - Tribeca Global Management", "And at this point, when you lay out your capital program and financing, and everything like that, you make no assumptions that actually occurs?", "Joseph A. Householder", "We do not.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ashar Khan from Visium.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Can I just ask, you mentioned that depending upon the wildfire insurance proceeds it will depend where you end up as part of the guidance. What is in the dispute over there, the amount or getting it this quarter?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll address that, Ashar, good morning to you. We have filings before the CPUC now that would provide for a recovery of about $50 million on an after-tax basis. And last year, we got a decision granting us this incremental amount for wildfire insurance. And this year, we followed the process, which was to file an advice letter which we did for part of this in April and part of it in September. So if you look at the history, we recovered these amounts last year, the issue that we don't know when a CPUC decision might come out for this year, for the $50-plus million of earnings that we're waiting for from the incremental fire recovery.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "So the issue is only that it might go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, right? So that's the issue. It's not the amount?", "Debra L. Reed", "I can't speak of what the commission will do, but I can tell you that last year, they approved the recovery of a filing that we had for $29 million or $16 million after tax. And we recovered all of that in December of last year. What the commission does going forward, I can't say what they're going to do but we had a history of recovery, and now it's largely a timing issue.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Worms from BMO.", "Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "This may be a question more for Mark. But with regard to the Cameron facility and developing the liquefaction plant, and I know it's very early in the process and there's a DOE review at least at some point, but what other regulatory approvals might you need? And let's just assume for argument's sake that at some point you get a green light and you go forward with all of this, what's the time frame from at that point to completion when the liquefaction plant will actually be operating? How long are we looking at? 3 years, 5 years?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll have Mark answer those questions for you.", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay. Well, look, on the regulatory side, the other fairly big permit that you need is from the FERC as well, and then there's a host of other construction and environmental permits and those kinds of things that you\u2019d have to go through in that area. But I think the FERC permit could be a 12- to 18-month kind of process. Beyond that, the construction period, it will depend a lot on the type of facility, the size and how long it will take. But it could be -- you would, look, think of this as a couple of year construction period at a minimum. And so it's fairly far down the line. And really our purpose in highlighting it today is because of the swirl of activity around it. And also because we do plan to file for our DOE permit, and you're going to see that as a public filing and we wanted to give you a heads-up on that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This may be a Jeff Martin question. Just curious in terms of when you're looking out at the California and Nevada and the Arizona utilities, where we are in terms of the RFP or the RFO cycle? Meaning, when was the last time RFPs were issued by the 3 big California utilities, the Arizona and Nevada ones, when do you expect to get answers back from them? When would decisions likely occur?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, as I mentioned, we're already, we're successful in the spur deal for 240 megawatts, and there is an RFP that is out right now. And so I'll have Mark talk about that and the timing.", "Mark A. Snell", "I can't disclose a lot about the RFP process other than to say that all of the Nevada and Arizona utilities are looking at different opportunities to change their generation mix, the desire to kind of wean themselves off of coal, move into natural gas fired generation and also to move into renewables is strong. We're working with all the interested parties on a lot of different projects. But they're \u2013 they'll kind of get done when they get done. And there isn't really a season for this, although that they do tend to try to solidify their summer, their peak load needs early, early on. But most of these are multi-year types of engagements. And so they're not really geared towards sort of the -- it's not just like, we're not just looking for next summer. They're looking for multi-year kind of commitments.", "Operator", "And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Debbie Reed for any closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, thank you for joining us for Sempra's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead.", "Steven D. Davis", "Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bruce Folkmann, Acting Controller.", "You'll note that Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and the Table A of the financial tables in our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings release for reconciliation to GAAP measures. ", "With that, I'll turn it over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 3.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, we'll review our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. We'll then talk about our dividend increase and I'll give you an operational update on our businesses. ", "Now to the financial results.  Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $292 million or $1.21 per share compared with $280 million or $1.15 in the same period last year. For the full year 2011, we recorded earnings of approximately $1.4 billion or $5.62 per share compared with 2010 earnings of $739 million or $2.98 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the full year 2011 were $1.1 billion, which excludes a gain of $277 million that we reported in the second quarter to reflect the write up in value of our investments in Chile and Peru. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2011 was $4.47 compared to $3.93 per share of adjusted earnings in 2010, which is an increase of 14%.", "I'm very pleased with our strong results in both the fourth quarter and for the year. Each of our businesses performed extremely well, enabling us to beat the upper end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2011 which was $4.30. ", "Now regarding the dividend. I'd like to mention that earlier this morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have authorized a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend, which brings the annualized dividend to $2.40 per share. You may recall that last February, we also increased the dividend by more than 20%. The strong and growing operating cash flows from our utility and contracted infrastructure businesses, we expect to continue to grow the dividend while reinvesting capital to achieve above average long-term earnings growth. ", "Now let me hand it over to Joe so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thank you, Debbie. San Diego Gas & Electric earnings for the fourth quarter were $158 million, up from $105 million in the year-ago quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 included $50 million of earnings related to increased wildfire insurance premium recovery for an 18-month period and $13 million of higher equity AFUDC earnings compared to the year-ago period.", "I'd like to point out that in December of both 2010 and 2011, CPUC approved SDG&E's request to recover the increased cost of wildfire insurance premiums. SDG&E has one additional request pending to recover increased wildfire insurance premiums, which we expect the commission to approve in the second quarter. $15 million of the benefit we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflects this anticipated cost recovery. Going forward, the anticipated recovery of wildfire insurance is contained in SDG&E's 2012 general rate case.", "SDG&E also expects to recover any costs incurred that are associated with the 2007 wildfires in excess of amounts recovered from its insurance coverage and other responsible third parties, as we've disclosed in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs. As of the end of 2011, SDG&E has booked a regulatory assets of $594 million associated with its anticipated recovery.", "Full-year 2011 earnings increased to $431 million from $369 million last year. The increase of $62 million was due primarily to $31 million of higher equity AFUDC earnings, net of higher interest expense and $28 million for higher revenues related to wildfire insurance premiums, net of the higher insurance expense.", "Moving to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were $79 million compared to $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, earnings for SoCal were $287 million compared to earnings of $286 million in 2010. ", "Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $39 million in the same quarter of 2010. The increase was due largely to $24 million of higher earnings from our operations in South America through the accretive acquisition we closed in April of last year. For the full year 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $527 million compared with earnings of $159 million in 2010. Excluding the $277 million gain that was recorded in the second quarter of 2011, related to the acquisition of controlling interest in the operations in Chile and Peru, earnings were $250 million in 2011. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to $55 million from the increased ownership interest in South America, $13 million of higher earnings from the Mexican pipeline assets that we acquired in April 2010 and $10 million from nonoperating foreign exchange effects related mainly to a U.S. dollar-denominated cash balance, previously held in Chile. ", "Now, please turn to Slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $18 million in the prior year's period. For the full year of 2011, Sempra LNG had earnings of $99 million, up from earnings of $68 million in 2010. The increase for the full year was due primarily to higher earnings from contracted cargoes that were not delivered.  Earnings in 2011 also included $18 million in marketing activities that we currently do not expect to recur in 2012. ", "I'd also like to take a moment here to discuss our contract with the Tangguh partners to supply LNG to our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul terminal. We entered into this contract in 2004 and the 20-year contract became effective in the second half of 2009. You may recall that the contract permits our counter-party to divert cargoes to other markets in exchange for a fee. Given the wide disparity between the price of natural gas in Asia and the U.S., we have seen a significant increase in the amount of diverted cargoes and a resulting in increasing our earnings. In light of these market conditions, we have amended this contract to provide enhanced value to both parties, including certainty of cargoes for Sempra and additional flexibility for the Tangguh partners. For Sempra, this will result in more consistent earnings from that contract going forward.", "With that said, we currently expect 2012 earnings from LNG to be more in line with our prior guidance of $50 million to $70 million, as the benefit of the contract amendment will be offset by lower natural gas prices. Over the longer term, however, we expect earnings from our existing LNG operations to be roughly $65 million to $85 million per year. As you may recall, Sempra LNG will no longer be a reporting segment starting with the results in the first quarter of 2012, and we do not expect to regularly provide earnings guidance for this business going forward. ", "Now, please move to the next slide. Our generation business recorded a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2010. The loss in the fourth quarter of 2011 was due to the exploration of the 10-year contract with the California Department of Water Resources, which expired on September 30, 2011, and also to a mark-to-market loss of $9 million. ", "For the full year 2011, Sempra Generation recorded earnings of $137 million compared with earnings of $103 million in 2010. The increase in earnings for 2011 was due primarily to an $87 million litigation settlement that negatively impacted 2010 results, and due to the lower earnings from our natural gas plants due primarily to the expiration of the CDWR contract. ", "Now, please to move Slide 8. Through the end of 2011, we recognized the investment tax credits from our solar business as a tax benefit in the year that the new capacity was placed in service. This method, called the flow-through method, created an even earnings profile for our solar business. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, we will begin using the deferral method of accounting for these projects. Under this method, the book basis of the asset will be reduced by the amount of the investment tax credit, resulting in lower depreciation and more  even ongoing earnings as compared with the flow-through method.", "I want to stress that this change in accounting method has no impact on the economics of our solar projects. These projects are contracted for 20-plus years with utility counter-parties. The switch to deferral accounting does, however, result in a decrease of approximately $0.40 per share in 2012 compared with the earnings under the old method. The offset to the lower initial earnings will be lower depreciation and higher earnings in future years under the new method.", "Taking into account the use of deferral accounting and considering other changes across our business, we are now expecting our earnings per share to be within the range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2012. And due to strong business unit growth and performance, we continue to expect Sempra's long-term EPS growth rate to be in the 6% to 8% range. ", "Now, please go to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned earlier, our Board authorized a 25% increase in our common stock dividend. This takes the dividend to $2.40 per share on an annualized basis, up from the current annualized dividend of $1.92 per share. You may recall that our Board established a target dividend payout ratio of 45% to 50% last year. While we are not changing our long-term target payout ratio, we expect to exceed that level for the next several years, and we do expect to increase the dividend as our earnings grow.", "One of the considerations behind the dividend increase relates to the significant amount of earnings from our South American utilities and Mexican businesses, coupled with certain tax position. Historically, we have reinvested those earnings into our international businesses. ", "Beginning in 2013, we intend to distribute current earnings of about $300 million to the United States from certain of our international subsidiaries. The additional amount of cash tax that we will pay is expected to be very minimal in the near-term but the tax will largely be offset by net operating losses from bonus depreciation and renewable energy tax credits. While the use of these tax assets is a good economic decision, it will reduce earnings by approximately $0.30 per share beginning in 2013 due to additional booked tax expense.", "We expect to use of most of the repatriated earnings to repay debt and, to a lesser extent, to support the higher dividend we announced today. ", "The point that I'd like to leave you with is that we have stable and growing businesses, both in the United States and internationally that produce strong cash flows that can support a higher dividend going forward. ", "And with that, I'll hand the call back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Now let me update you on some of the key activities within our businesses, starting with our California utility. Last month, hearings concluded in San Diego Gas & Electric's and Southern California Gas Company's general rate case proceedings. The schedule for the rate case, which was issued by the commission late last year, calls for a rate case decisions around March of this year. But now we expect the case to be resolved later than what had been set forth in the original schedule. The commission has yet to issue a revised proceeding scheduled, but opening brief have been schedule for April while reply briefs are due in May. It is important to mention that the revenue requirement established in the rate cases will be retroactive to January 1, 2012. And I'd also note that until a final decision is reached, we'll be recording revenues based on currently authorized levels. In the quarter, in which a final decision is reached, we'll record the retroactive increase in earnings since the beginning of the year.", "Moving to some of the major capital projects. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction of Sunrise Powerlink is now more than 75% complete and we continue to expect that it will be going into service in the second half of this year. ", "Turning to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Last week, Commissioner Florio released a proposed schedule, which calls for hearings during the summer and briefs due in October of this year. We're also waiting for the commission to authorize a memorandum account to track the project cost.", "Now, I'd like to take you to Slide 11. On renewables business, construction has begun on the 150-megawatt expansion of the Copper Mountain Solar project in Nevada. In December, the CPUC approved our 25-year contract to sell the power generated by the plant to PG&E. We expect to complete 92 megawatts by the end of January 2013, and we'll bring the remaining 58 megawatts into service by 2015. ", "Also in December, we agreed to partner with BP Wind to jointly develop 2 projects that will have a combined capacity of 560 megawatts at a total cost of $1 billion. These projects include the 419-megawatt Flat Ridge 2 project in Kansas and the 141-megawatt Mehoopany project in Pennsylvania. Both projects are expected to be completed by the end of this year.  These 2 projects will more than double the amount of operating net wind capacity at our U.S. Gas & Power business, all of which is in partnership with BP Wind. ", "We now have nearly 1,000 megawatts of renewables project either in operation, under construction or contracted. We've made tremendous strides in the development of our renewables business and is a great example of how we've been able to leverage an existing asset decision to drive future growth. ", "Now let's go on to the final slide.  I am very pleased to the results of all of our businesses for both the quarter and the year. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 14% in 2011, and we exceeded our financial outlook for the year. While our new 2012 earnings per share guidance of $4 to $4.30 was negatively impacted by $0.40 due to the move to new solar accounting method, the change provides more consistent and growing earnings going forward as we develop our solar portfolio. And with strong business unit growth and performance, we expect to grow our earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% over the longer term. ", "Finally, I'd like to remind you that we'll be holding our Annual Analyst Conference here at San Diego on March 29. At the conference, we'll provide an update on the strategic direction of the company, and we'll provide an overview of our earnings outlook and capital program at that time. ", "I'll leave the details for March, but we expect to show you a plan that generates above average earnings growth, which when combined with our competitive dividend, provides a compelling investment opportunity.", "With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to talk about the dividend and growth here. So then, the new dividend certainly is above the overall payout ratio target, and I think I follow what you're indicating in terms of ability to grow into that and continue to grow the dividend. As we think about dividend growth given that, right now, the dividend is essentially sort of above that long-term payout ratio level, should we be thinking about growth in line with further earnings growth or how should we think about just how that dividend may grow over time?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, Stephen, when we set the dividend level -- the Board, obviously, sets the dividend level. But one of the things we looked at is the long-term earnings growth that we have in our 5-year plan that we'll be showing you at the analyst conference. And as we mentioned, we see 6% to 8% growth in that plan. So we believe that there's still upward potential for that dividend. It may be slightly less than the earnings growth that we have in that plan, but we could still have that 50% payout ratio, 45% to 50%, on a long-term basis and continue to have some growth in the dividend.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, as we think about earnings growth over time, you've laid out the target growth level, it sounds like over time, you'll be able to repatriate some capital from Latin America, which sounds great. Sounds like there would be an earnings impact. Does this earnings growth profile reflect in the EPS impacts of that cash repatriation?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, and you will see this, and we're not going to go through the details of the 5-year plan here on this call, but the 6% to 8% that we've quoted reflects in the -- bottoms up strategic review of our businesses, the repatriation scenario and all the things that we're reflecting in our business plans going forward, which we'll share with you in detail in March.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "Just to clarify, so the impact of adjusting the accounting methodology for the solar impacts earnings $0.40 a share in 2012. And then what would -- how should we think about that on an ongoing basis for 2013 and beyond? And I understand you don't want to give specific guidance, but then that separate and apart, I think, from the $0.30 per share negative impact from the higher taxes associated with repatriating the money from Latin America. I'm just not sure to what extent those 2 items are related, if at all?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, Leslie, there's actually 2 different things going on, and you correctly indicated that they are separate items. The item where we changed the accounting method for 2012, that's about $0.40 a share. We'll go through the details with you in the analyst presentation because we really have to build up on what solar projects we were planning in each of the years. And so there's some variability in that from year-to-year, but $0.40 is a pretty reasonable number to use for that. And in separate and apart from that is the decision to repatriate, which we would begin in 2013. And we would then be able to see what happens with all the tax law changes potentially and all, but begin the repatriation there and would take a reduction in our earnings outlook for 2013 of about $0.30 related to that. Joe, did you want to add anything...", "Joseph A. Householder", "No, think that's right. I think over to 5 years, it's a $0.25 to $0.35 for the repatriation cash. It's not cash tax, it's book tax. We'll have a very small cash tax on that. But we'll have book earnings impact of $0.25 to $0.35 over that 5-year period.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just to clarify, on the deferral treatment method for the solar tax treatment, that's just on new projects going forward, there is no impact to the previous projects you brought online, is that right?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I'm going to have Joe describe exactly how that works. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "When we get to the first quarter, now that we're on the new method in Q1, when we report our results for the 10-Q, we will have to go back and recast the prior year's but it's fairly small. But what you saw in 2011 is under the old method, under the flow-through method, but all of 2010 and 2011 will be recast under this method.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And is that the life of the facility, so is it like 20 years of kind of deferrals is how that works?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, it's over the depreciated life.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just so I'm clear on the foreign tax issue for 2013, because you pay lower taxes in other countries and in South America, the difference basically is the tax that you pay there versus the tax you pay here and that's the $0.25 to $0.35 you're going to end up having to occur next year, is that right?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Faisal, this is Joe. That's correct. We have an average tax rate on all of our foreign income that's accumulated throughout all the periods of around 20%. So to bring it back and pay Federal and California taxes is about another 20%, let's say.", "Debra L. Reed", "One thing I do want to stress that Joe mentioned is that, that there's very little cash tax. It's deferred tax, and so the earnings that we talked about with the $0.30 starting in 2013 is not a cash tax amount. It's a deferred tax amount.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got you. Fair enough. And then just on the generation business, if I exclude the mark-to-market loss in the quarter, is there any way for your guys to give us kind of an idea of how much of a drag the gas-fired generation fleet was on that business? Because as I suspect that your -- on a pretax basis, your renewable portfolio was profitable, but at the fossil fuel fleet, that was probably a drag on earnings, but I have no way of kind of figuring that out?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I'll ask Mark to go through a little bit of high level on that.", "Mark A. Snell", "Right. Faisal, it's Mark. Your intuition is correct. I mean, we did have a small loss on the fossil fuel fleet. Although in our plans going forward, we expect to operate that fleet profitably even on a GAAP basis, kind of a break even to slightly positive, and certainly very positive on a cash flow basis. And then we also have the earnings from the fossil fuel -- from the renewable fleet in addition to that. But we'll get into the details of that at the Analyst Conference and we'll show you those numbers.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael Goldenberg from Luminus Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "I'm sorry if I'm going back to the same questions on accounting, but I just want to be crystal clear on the 2 items that you've identified. On the repatriation of international earnings, the $0.30, the higher tax rate that you'll be paying when you repatriate, is that going to be backed out as a onetime item or basically every year, when you bring it back in, it will just grow at the state of income tax expense that we will see on the income statement?", "Debra L. Reed", "As we record that, it'll be shown every year. It'll be recurring as a deferred tax item that we'll be recording. As I mentioned, we won't be paying the cash taxes because we'll have a net operating loss, and so those cash taxes for the most part are deferred for 5-plus years. Joe, I don't know if you want to add anymore to that...", "Joseph A. Householder", "I think that's right. Michael, I'll just add this. I mentioned that we intend, in 2013, to start bringing back current earnings from some of the subsidiaries and our expectation is about $300 million for several years in a row, at least. And so if you think about the book tax effect of that might be about 20% of $300 million for several years in a row.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "Got it. And then the other question is on the solar tax credits that changed from onetime to deferral method. So I understand that will significantly smooth out the earnings profile. But based on my understanding, the way other companies do it, there's still a higher tax benefit in year 1 versus year 2 through the end of the life. Can you give us a sense of relative tax benefit for year 1 versus years 2, 3 that will now be for a new solar project?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, Michael, this is Joe. I'll just try to do it with a rough example. If you spend $100 million under the investment credit method, you would reduce your tax basis by 1/2 of that investment credit of 30. So then you have to book a deferred tax liability, we'll call it 35% of that difference, about $5 million, and then you have $30 million of ITC. So you book the $25 million benefit on the $100 million that you spent. Under the new method, the book basis goes down by the whole ITC, so it goes down by 30. That tax still goes down by 15 and you actually a book a deferred tax benefit of 5. So you're booking 5 instead of 25 in that first year. That's just the one-time sort of 5% of the cost, you're booking it right then.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "And what will be the tax benefit now in years 2 through 5, 6 our life of the project?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Your $30 million will reduce depreciation. It's not going through the income line. It's going to reduce depreciation over the 25 or so years, 25-year life of the project.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I would say, we will go through this in detail at the analyst conference and go through some examples and also that you'll be able to see the effect of this.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll hear from Greg Gordon from ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm sure you realized you were opening up Pandora's Box when you gave us some, but not all, of the goodies from the Analyst Day. But I just wanted to ask, just structurally speaking, clearly, the earnings -- you re-based the earnings here in 2012 by making the accounting change on the solar, which I think most of your investors and analysts would say was the right way to go. But I guess when I think about '13, '14, '15, it's clear how you're generating the incremental cash flow to fund the dividend payment. Thank you for articulating that. You're going to show us at the Analyst Day what the offsetting factors that sort of fill in that $0.30 incremental, sort of headwind, associated with the noncash tax impact. Because in order for you to sort of -- if we think about a straight-line 5% to 6% earnings growth rate, you'd have to have a fairly significant offsetting earnings growth driver in that year to not have sort a growth rate at least in '13 that looked  like your longer term aspiration. So are you going to be able to show us what the sort of the puts are that offset that sort of incremental headwind in '13 when we see you in March?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we will show you, when we see you in March and what we've shown you before, which is the 5-year growth rate. And the growth rate is not going to be necessarily even in each of these years. It's not necessarily a linear function. And I so I don't want to leave you with that impression. But over the 5-year period, we're looking at 6% to 8% growth in our plan over the 5-year period of time, and we'll be able to show you how that occurs. And what fills in that growth, and a lot of it, if you look at our 2 utilities as an example, over the 5 years, SoCalGas is going to grow at about 7.5%. And SDG&E over 5%. So you have a lot of it embedded in projects that have already been approved at our utilities or are in the regulatory process of our utilities, then we'll go through all of that at the analyst conference.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So we shouldn't assume a linear progression but over the sort of normal 5-year forecast horizon that you usually roll forward, you'll be able to sort of validate how you get to [ph] that aspiration?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. That's how you should look at it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I wanted to ask you just, I mean, I guess I don't want to belabor this and it sounds like a lot it is going to be other analyst meeting. But just to clarify, the $0.30 of impact in future years associated with the repatriation, you guys are still expecting to grow 6% to 8% growth in spite of that, correct?", "Debra L. Reed", "That's correct. The 6% to 8% growth over the 5-year plan period includes the impact of everything we've talked about today. And it also includes the bottom-up review of all of our businesses. And as an example, if you look at what we talked about with the forecast for 2012 in our guidance, we would have been at $4.40 to $4.70. It was $0.10 higher than where we were last year based upon the performance of our businesses but then that's reduced by the $0.40 from the change of accounting method which, again, has no economic effect on the business. But we've heard from a lot of you that you would like to have a better sense, not to have to time when these projects go into service precisely. And so this allows for that type of greater predictability. All of that's incorporated, the repatriation is incorporated. And with all of that, we're looking at 6% to 8% growth over the 5-year time frame.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then the $0.40, and I know you went through these, the calculation on the book deferral and what have you, just, what is the impact of the $0.40 in 2013, if we could just get a little bit of flavor for that, in other words, by taking a hit in 2012, there will be a benefit in 2013. Do you guys have a rough approximation as to what that would be?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we're going to hold off to go through the 2013 numbers at the Analyst Meeting. The only thing that we wanted to do was to let you all know that we were making this change, so we didn't surprise you with that at the Analyst Meeting. So we wanted you to know we're changing in terms of repatriation and the rationale behind that. Again it's a good economic decision for us because we have this net operating losses that we can use now by doing this, and we just wanted to give you awareness of that. We will go through all the details at the Analyst Meeting.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then just on the decision to do the repatriation from the international business, could you just like give us a little more flavor as to sort of what's kind of caused this? I mean, is it simply because of the international outlook versus tax issues? And just in general, is there any issue with respect to potential changes because we keep on hearing about tax reform in various things showing up regarding taxing of foreign entities, and taxing of just, in general, I mean, vast changes perhaps in the tax code. I mean just in terms of your flexibility with respect to this issue and what have you?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, that's an excellent question. And we spend a lot of time on this. I'll give you a very high level on it then I'm going to have Joe go through the details on the flexibility. But from a strategic standpoint, these businesses are doing really well, and they are generating a great deal of cash, and if we did not repatriate cash, we would build up excess cash in excess of what we need to grow those businesses by 6% to 8% per year, of something over, around $1.5 billion. And that it didn't seem appropriate to us to keep that cash offshore, and be able to fund all of our growth and not look at some changes to the capital structure of those businesses because we have the ability to put leverage on those businesses locally. We feel that is a better long-term capital structure for those businesses. And with this net operating loss that we have, because of the bonus depreciation and because of the solar tax credit, if we were going to repatriate funds, then this would be the best time to do that, but for any type of tax holiday and all. And I'm going to have Joe talk to you about our assessment of that and what flexibility we have, because we do have a great deal of flexibility relative to changing our timing of repatriation based upon what might happen within a national tax policy. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Okay. Thanks, Debbie. Yes, Paul, exactly what Debbie was saying, this started out in our strategic review and our capital allocation process and looking at the international operations, what their requirements were, the very low debt-to-cap ratios we have in those countries and then the overall tax position as Debbie articulated. And we took all that into the account. Then we thought about, well, what would be the effect if there were a change in tax policy. So what we've decided to do, and this is why we're announcing it now, is we want to let you know is that we were thinking about doing this in 2013. We would like to be able to see what happens with the election. See what happens with tax policy. It's not clear to me that very much will happen, but there's a lot of people talking about it. But what we intend to do is start taking the earnings effect of it in 2013 but probably not actually repatriate the cash until the end of the year, which gives us a long runway from now until the end of 2013 to see exactly what's going to happen with tax reform. If anything happens, it's likely that if it's going to benefit us, we'll know that, and then we would be repatriating anyway. As Debbie said, we have more cash buildup there than we need to even grow those earnings at 6% or 8% and towards the top of that range. So this -- a repatriation build that would allow cash to come back at lower rates would benefit us more. If it goes the other way and something like the President's proposal that came out, and says you're going to have to pay a minimum tax even if you don't bring the money, then what we're doing now even makes more sense. We might as well bring it here and use it in the U.S. and use up these tax assets that we have sooner than we would otherwise use them.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Makes a lot of sense. Finally, just the Tangguh and the lower gas pricing, you guys mentioned the contract changes and amendments and lower gas prices kind of offsetting each other. Could you just give us a flavor as to the impact of both of those?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I'm going to ask Mark to...", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, with respect to Tangguh, we renegotiated the contract and where we ended up with is, we allowed our partners to have more flexibility to divert cargoes, and we were compensated for allowing that extra flexibility. And that offset the effect of lower gas prices on our plan going forward. So all in all, it was a positive for them, and it actually is a positive for us to because we have a guaranteed number of deliveries. It's a small number, but it's the total amount we need to keep the plant cool. And we're also allowed to divert a cargo to other our facility in the Gulf, which eliminates the need to buy an expensive cargo there to keep that plant cool. So I think, all in all, the renegotiation, it's always kind of trite to say that it's a win-win but it's truly one that would turn out better for both parties.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So the financial impact of that versus to get lower gas prices is sort of what?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, kind of flat.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. But what was the impact, I guess, from one of them?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, we're not disclosing what the financial impact of the contract is. But you'll see it in the LNG numbers when we do the Analyst Conference.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ashar Khan from Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Just wanted to, I don't know, I guess, coincidental, I was just looking -- I just want to understand the assumptions, I think if I understand. But if I look at Slide 2 from the last deck that you provided at your Analyst Conference, the 2011's outlook was $4 to $4.30, growing 6% to 8% percent and then we came to a $5.50 to a $5.80 number as part of the 2015 target. So if I -- using what you are pretty consistent, of course, we lost, now, '12 is back to $4 to $4.30, the growth rate is 6% to 8% EPS. So I'm assuming the range if I impute it from last year, the range should be similar because the growth rate hasn't changed, the base is the same and so the range should be I guess '16 should be $5.50 to $5.80 if I impute what was done last year. And am I thinking through this rightly? The base is going to be '12 and you're looking towards the '16 targets.", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm not going to give you the '16 target until we get to the Analyst Meeting. But I think your calculations do make sense, and we'll go through the details of '16 and what our estimates are at the Analyst Conference. But your methodology is how we get to our 6% to 8%.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. And then if I could just go back, I guess the business that -- I'm just looking through which did better than forecast, one was pipeline and storage. I guess it came out $2.50 versus the high-end of $2.20. I know there was $18 million from a kind of like a tax related issue when you brought the money thing. But is there anything in that business that I guess the rest of the gains were all permanent better operations that are going to go on forward, just trying to ...", "Debra L. Reed", "Excuse me, I'm sorry...", "Ashar Khan", "No, just trying to get a sense of the strength of the business, I'm assuming it's permanent and we can grow from there?", "Debra L. Reed", "The main thing that happened, of course, in pipes and storage, is we acquired the South American utilities in April of last year. And that, that business -- those utilities performance will be ongoing, and we'll have a full year's effect of that this year. So when you look at the earnings in pipes and storage and the significant increase there, it's largely from the acquisition.", "Joseph A. Householder", "There were up couple of a onetime things that I think were mentioned that there was some gains from some cash, some U.S. dollars we held in Chile at the time. It's not there anymore. But originally, it was there. And there was some foreign exchange gain of about $10 million and we had some Mexican tax benefits in that business also. So there's a roughly $20 million in there that was I would say more a onetime than continuing.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll hear from Mark Barnett from Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Mark Barnett, Morningstar. Just a couple of quick questions, maybe out of the weeds here a little bit. So you know you had at the end of last quarter 2 plants left to kind of on the contracting side after the expiration of the DWR contract. And I'm wondering how those plants are looking and whether you had finalized kind of marketing those for the next few years?", "Debra L. Reed", "Let me have Mark talk about that because this -- clearly, as part of our strategic review, we have looked at every market and we have looked at every asset, and we've done a full assessment. And so let me have Mark just comment on that and again, we'll be going through a lot of this detail at the Analyst Day.", "Mark A. Snell", "Good question, Mark. Let me talk to you a little bit at how we're looking at these assets, and I think it will be indicative of kind of our entire strategic review process. The first thing we're doing is we are doing a fairly thorough market review of what we think those assets would sell for in the marketplace. And we're just about done with that with respect to the plants. And then as we figure out what that number is, then we look at what we believe our earnings from those operations will be. And we then, frankly, do a very simple calculation and say that if we got those proceeds, could we do better in other parts of our business? And we're kind of making that evaluation right now. But if we can think we can do better someplace else with that money, we're likely to move it into another part of the business. If we think that the current market just doesn't put enough value on those and we're getting an extraordinary return on the value we can get, we're likely to hold them for a while until that situation changes. Obviously, we wouldn't do that if we thought it was going to get worse. But if we thought it was going to get better, we'd continue to hold them. And we're making that, and we'll probably have some of those decisions done by the Analyst Conference. But we are looking at those. We put everything on the table, and it's just a way that we're thinking about it right now. And, frankly, I think we're in -- it's that process that just continues to move forward.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "All right. And I guess this is probably something else you will, so forgive me, you will probably address at the Analyst Day. But you received at the end of last month the initial permit for liquefaction from Cameron, I believe. And then I know that there's a second round for exploring the countries without free-trade agreements. I'm just wondering, had you already initiated that or are you waiting to sort of evaluate what you want to do on the investments side to apply for that second license?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. In terms of that, we filed for and received the U.S. free-trade export license from DOE already in January. And we also filed separately for the non-FTA countries, which is now pending. We also have to file a FERC permit, which we would expect to do sometime around the second quarter of this year. And that's likely to take 12 to 18 months. So that's kind of the timeline we're on.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to  Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Debbie, rate case. How do you think about how far apart you guys are versus the interveners at both SDG&E and SoCalGas, kind of what's the bid? How far are apart are you on both O&M and on actual rate base expectations? And what are the likelihoods of settlement? You guys have been one of the best at settling rate cases in California over the years. Just curious to see where we stand now.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thank you, Michael. It's nice to speak with you this morning. In terms of the rate case, as you mentioned, we have a history of settling our cases, and the thing that I would note it that while the numbers between ourselves and the DRA staff may seem large on the surface, when you start drilling into them, there are a lot of the things that have been litigated time and time again in rate cases. They deal with what's the relative level of compensation or they deal with how we account for certain depreciation of asset. So there are issues that have been raised multiple times in rate cases. They have been litigated and/or settled and settled in the favor of how we filed them in the rate case. So I don't feel like we're truly as far apart as it might seem when you look at the filings that have been made by the parties and ourselves. We have been in discussions with parties. But I also say, we have a strong case. We completed the hearings in January. And if we're not able to reach a settlement that we think is the right amount for us to operate our business safely and effectively, then we are fine going through the regulatory process. But we do have a history, as you mentioned, of settling, and we always like to be able to try to work with the parties and see if we can't come up with a resolution that works for everyone.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. One other thing, rate case or tied to the regulated utility subsidiaries, what's remaining in terms of incentive compensation of earns -- incentive structure that the utilities can earn above and beyond kind of the traditional GRC? I'm thinking gas and -- your purchased gas incentive. I'm thinking energy efficiency. What's left going into 2012 versus what is kind of already halted and won't be there going forward?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay, let me try to hit the major categories. We have at the gas company the gas cost incentive mechanism, and that is remaining in place. In fact, we've just got a draft decision this week, granting or recommending that we receive the incentive from what we filed last what year. And then we have a storage incentive mechanism at the gas company that allows us to market storage and to the extent we recover more than our embedded cost and there's a sharing mechanism on that. In terms of energy efficiency, that is up for review right now by the commission as to what is going to be a mechanism for energy efficiency going forward. And so we're not quite certain as to what the mechanism will ultimately be, but that is something that's up for review. And then at SDG&E, we also have a gas PBR mechanism similar to what we have at SoCalGas. And so those are the key mechanisms that are still in place.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Last item, renewable projects. Obviously, you've got a lot in the hopper. How do you think about whether you have the capability to expand upon that in the next 2 to 3 years, not necessarily next 5, but thinking more near-term, next 2 to 3 years, meaning the potential for incremental solar projects in all likelihood?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, as you know, we have exceptional land position. And that -- as an example at ESJ in Northern Mexico, we have a project now that is just the first phase and maybe about 10% of the total capacity potential to be built at that location. That is for approval at the commission on March 8. So that there is some great opportunity there for wind potentially to grow. We have land positions adjacent to our power plants in Arizona and Nevada, and then we have a land position in Central California, all of which we will participate in RFPs and be able to bid out. And then we have some partnerships that we've formed where we work with other companies as we have with BP to take partner projects that they have and us be a 50-50 partner. Mark, I don't if you want add any more color to that.", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I just would say I think it is a very robust pipeline that we have. And I think we'll continue to grow the business at significant rates. And it's a very profitable business for us. About look at all of our options down the line with respect to renewables, I think we're pretty excited about where it can take us and where it'll go. There's all kinds of options with respect to capital availability and things, where we can put very -- continue to put very little capital into it and get great earnings and great returns.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. I'm sorry, I wanted to cheat - last one here. Joe, I want to simplify the tax issue. In 2012 GAAP tax rates versus cash tax rates, and if you can give that for '13 as well, that'd be great.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Just a minute, Michael, let me grab that. 2012, let's say our GAAP tax rate is going to be around 30%. Cash tax rate will be fairly low. I don't have a percentage, but we would have a modest Californian tax and probably between California and our foreign businesses, maybe around $100 million of tax.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. In '13?", "Joseph A. Householder", "In '13 -- or '12. In '13 I think we'll get more into those numbers when we get to the conference.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Vedula Murti from CDP Capital.", "Vedula Murti", "Let's see, most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to make sure if we think about the repatriation issue, if we think about the kind of like the status quo, such that nothing changes, how many years of NOLs and other types of things do you have such that you could repatriate $300 million a year back to the U.S. with minimal cash taxes?", "Debra L. Reed", "Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, this is Joe. We're expecting, depending on how this plays out, but assuming the status quo, we would probably repatriate about $300 million a year, to around 2018.", "Vedula Murti", "Okay. So you can do that with...", "Joseph A. Householder", "So you've got both NOLs and -- sorry, go ahead.", "Vedula Murti", "So you've got about 5 years or so with very minimal cash taxes?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. We have several years of net operating losses that we could absorb. And then we also have renewable energy credits that we can use.", "Vedula Murti", "Okay. And we've just spent a lot of time talking about EPS growth off of these headwinds of 6% to 8%, but all these headwinds have had no effect on cash. Can you talk about the cash flow growth rate over the next 5 years so does the EPS growth rate? Should we -- will we see a commensurate increase in cash flow growth or are we going to see the reversal which we have seen, where cash flow is fine and EPS reported GAAP has these headwinds and then EPS -- and then EPS improved, but cash flow kind of stable or doesn't keep up? Can you talk about the growth rate of cash flow over the period?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I would just say that I wouldn't see a big disconnect between cash flow and earnings over the period of time. If anything, the cash flow should be a little bit higher for the tax reasons that we talked about. And some of our assets are cash flow positive, but they're not producing stronger earnings. So I would say that for the purposes of where we are today, we'll go through that again at the Analyst Meeting. The purposes of where we are today to assume they're relatively parallel.", "Vedula Murti", "Okay. And one last question. In terms of where payout is and that type of thing, and obviously, with the outside uptick in terms of dividends today, should we just kind of think that going forward, just kind of plug that dividend growth going forward should be somewhere like half of like your targeted growth rate from here going forward?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I'd say our board looks at this every year. And the decision that they made this year with a larger increase in dividend was not predictable last year. But if you just kind of look at our earnings and you look at getting to a 50%, 45%, 50% payout ratio, you can envision the opportunity over the 5-year growth rate that we have that we should be able to continue to increase the dividend at some level that's slightly less than our earnings growth rate. So I mean, I think that we'll show you some of this when you show you the 5-year earnings growth rate and we'll show you the earnings and then you can kind of look at that dividend payout ratio and figure for yourself about how much greater it can be over the period of 5 years.", "Vedula Murti", "Great. I just to make sure that in terms of what I understand, that you've got a running room of about 5 years or so in terms of various NOLs and tax credit such that irrespective of U.S. tax policy, you'll be able to repatriate $300 million a year with minimal cash back, and that the growth rate on cash flow going forward is going to be comparable, if not superior, to what you're going to -- what you're striving to achieve in terms of GAAP EPS growth rate.", "Debra L. Reed", "That's correct.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question today from Naaz Khumawala from Bank of America.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I had just a couple of one clarification question and just a couple of other questions. On the $0.30 a share of hit, is that all in '13 or is that like $0.06 a year over the next 5 years? I was confused about how that was kind of said over the call.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The $0.30 per share, it continues. It doesn't increase, but it basically continues. We'd factored the time is based upon the amount you repatriate that year and what, if you're repatriating $30 million -- $300 million a year every year, then you'll have that hit for that one year for the deferred tax on the amount you're repatriating. So as long as you're repatriating, and let me just clarify, as long as your repatriating, then you would have that. If we decided to repatriate in 2013 and then something changed our view and we elected not to repatriate in 2014, then we would not have that $0.30 again in 2014. When we do have a lot of flexibility in this as to how we choose to repatriate, and when we make those elections.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I think the last time markets said that you have $1 billion of cash overseas, is that more like $1.5 billion now, if I just do $300 million from 5?", "Joseph A. Householder", "This is Joe. I think you'll probably referring to when Mark was talking about how much cash we had available, including that was prior to the acquisition of the South American utilities. So we have basically brought back or used in investment cash. There's not any big amounts of cash sitting there today. We have very low debt-to-cap ratios, as I mentioned. So we have the ability to grow those. We're not going to repatriate funds that we needed there to grow the business, and we also have the ability to borrow there if we want to fund additional investments beyond their really good growth that they have.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the last question on California, on the pipeline safety memo account that you had applied for, do you know what kind of timing you expect to receive that for this year?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, the memo account, we're anticipating sometime in the first half of the year getting the memo account established. And the assigned, Commissioner Florio, basically set the schedule for the proceeding that would have the closing brief filed in October, hearings in the summertime and then closing briefs in October. But we would expect the memo account to be put in place before that time. The other thing that was very positive is that in his decisions setting forth the procedural schedule, he encouraged us, once the memo account was established, to begin the rate collection of that so that there was not spikiness in terms of the rate recovery. So I think you'll see some movement in the first half of this year on the memo account in the latter half of this year, early next year, on the whole termination or completion of the preceding.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of how much of the $3.1 billion, if you did get the memo account, let's say, midyear, how much of that spend could you potentially do in '12 or how much have you anticipated in the guidance?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, in terms of what we would do in '12, it wouldn't be a great amount in '12. It would certainly be less than $100 million. And a lot depends on the timing of the memo account. But I would not anticipate a lot of expenditures in '12. It would be more of a ramp up. And then in '13, we will begin.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And so, I think you guys before have included about $400 million of pipeline safety spend in your 5-year CapEx, is that right?", "Debra L. Reed", "What we have for pipeline safety spend, we had $1.4 billion over the 5-year period of our plan. And as I said, when we did the 2012 numbers, we did a bottoms-up for 2012. So we looked at the situation that we feel that we're in today and what we think is going to happen today, and we redid our guidance for 2012. So whatever was in 2012 would now be deferred most likely to 2013. And that the total amount is still anticipated at $1.4 billion over a 5-year period.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Stephen Huang from Carlson Capital.", "Stephen Huang", "I was just wanted to double check and reconfirm something. The long-term growth rate, we're starting at the $4 to $4.30 2012 base, is that correct?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes.", "Stephen Huang", "Okay. And then, Joe, the second question I had was you mentioned that you would go back and recast the '10 and '11 solar and then bring them back forward. So is that basically you'll do like a onetime charge in '13 first quarter and then you'll kind of add $0.05 a share of earnings going forward per year? Are you basically taking '10 and '11 earnings and adding $0.05 going forward?", "Joseph A. Householder", "The 2010 and 2011, the financials will just be recast as if we had been on the other method in the prior years. And so there'll be slightly higher earnings over the next 25 years because we're moving those credits going forward into the future years.", "Debra L. Reed", "But there's no effect of...", "Joseph A. Householder", "There's no onetime effect in 2012 or 2013 of it. There's the continuing slow amortization of the ITC over the 25-year life.", "Stephen Huang", "Right. But it would add about $0.05 to ongoing -- in that ballpark of ongoing earnings, starting from '13 and going forward.", "Joseph A. Householder", "I'm not sure where -- how you're computing that number, but we'll go over this at the Analyst Conference [indiscernible].", "Stephen Huang", "But it should add a couple of pennies of earnings going forward. Or are you just moving it out?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, it should add a modest amount. That's correct.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Worms from BMO.", "Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Michael Worms. Just a quick question on the repatriation of the money in South America. At what point, I thought the plan was to build some transmission lines down there, and to potentially build another hydro plant or 2. So are those plans now and you going forward will just bring back money to the U.S.? Can you kind of give us some color on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "No, those plans are still in existence. And when we've done with our 5-year plan, we've incorporated the requirements to have that growth. We're still looking at transmission projects. We're building the hydro project right now in Peru that should be online at around 2013. And we have other hydro projects in Peru that we're bidding on, as well as transmission projects in Chile. Those projects are still incorporated in our plan, and we have the ability through operating cash flow from those businesses and local debt. We talk about the fact that those businesses really don't have any debt on them. And that we really feel that there's a preferred capital structure for those businesses where we would pay off some of the U.S. debt with the repatriated dollars and have local debt on those businesses, which make more sense for the projects that we're doing. So that's the way we will structure those projects in more of the kind of cap structure we'd like to see there in the long-term.", "Operator", "And James Heckler from Levin Capital Strategies has our next question.", "Neil Stein", "It's actually Neal Stein from Levin Capital. I have a couple of more questions on the repatriation issue and just as it relates to the growth rate. So you'll book a $0.30 adverse impact, EPS impact, from repatriation in 2013. Are you still able to grow 6% to 8% in that year or are you saying the 6% to 8% is applicable over the long-term and maybe you can't grow in '13 by that amount?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I'm not saying that it's going to -- I think, I've made a comment before, and I'll restate it. Our growth is going to be 6% to 8% over a 5-year time frame. And that there will be some unevenness in that growth from -- not every year is going to be 6% to 8% over their prior year. Some years maybe 3%, some years maybe 9%. And a lot of that has to do when projects come in, especially some of our renewable projects and when they start providing earnings. And so that we've never grown evenly. If you'd kind of look at our historical growth, it's been over a longer-term time frame that we give you the projections. And then when we see you at the end of March, we will give you the projections as we have and what our growth rate is over the longer term and then what we expect it to be in each of the early years.", "Neil Stein", "Well, could you say, are you able to specifically offset this $0.30 impact in '13?", "Debra L. Reed", "We're not giving 2013 guidance today. And so I'd rather wait and go through all of that with the total plan at the Analyst Conference. We've given you the 2012 guidance, which is what we always do on this call, and then when we get to the Analyst Meeting, we will go through and lay out for you what our expectations are over the 5-year time frame and in 2012, 2013.", "Neil Stein", "Well, let me ask this. There's the possibility you may book $0.30 maybe in one year or just a couple of years. I guess there is also the possibility you may book at meeting you'll repatriate $300 million of cash every single year over the 5-year period? Is that a possibility? And if you were to be booking this $0.30 adverse impact from the repatriation tax, would you still be able to grow 6% to 8% for the 5-year period?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I mean, what we've assumed is that we would have the $300 million a year repatriated every year over the time frame of the 5 years. And even with that, that we would have a 6% to 8% growth rate over that 5-year time frame.", "Operator", "Our next question today is from John Ali [ph] from Decade Capital.", "Unknown Analyst", "Sorry to keep asking about this. Just to be clear, the 6% to 8% growth, so you're going in year 5, if you took the repatriation, you'd still have that number?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Again, the way -- yes. The way we've looked at it is we've calculated the growth over that 5-year plan, and it includes the change in solar accounting and it includes the repatriation.", "Unknown Analyst", "Every year?", "Debra L. Reed", "And we look at it over the 5-year and, we said that, that compound annual growth rate over that 5-year period will be 6% to 8%. Now that doesn't mean that every year grows 6% to 8% over the prior year. It's not always even. But if you look at it over the 5-year time frame, then the average growth rate, the CAGR and earnings, ends up being 6% to 8% over that 5-year period.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And then -- it's Joe. Just to confirm, the repatriation is in the plan from 2013 through the remainder, not in 2012, but 2013 going forward.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The other thing I would say is that we're not going to give you the 2013 number today. But it's always positive growth. We're not going to have a decline in growth over the period of time. But it's not always going to be 6% to 8% year-over-year-over-year on a linear basis. But it will always be a positive growth, even taking into account the $0.30.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And the $300 million a year, how does that relate to the earnings you get every year, meaning what percentage of earnings is that or are you just re-levering the business?", "Joseph A. Householder", "It is most of the earnings from Mexico and Peru that we don't need in the business.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. I guess, what's the level of international earnings every year? And the other question I have is, Peru and Chile, how fast as they growing?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, Peru and Chile have growth rate of about 6% to 8%. And that's been the historical growth rate and that's kind of the projected growth rate, without some of the special projects. And that's just inherent in the basic utility business there is that you're running around 6% to 8% growth in total electric demand in those 2 countries and then about 3% to 4% customer growth each year. And then in addition to that, we have these special projects like the hydro project and transmission project.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. But just the run rate business is about 6% to 8% in terms of net income?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, towards the high end of that.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got you. And how much cash do you have overseas internationally?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, we just did a large acquisition so we don't have -- we used up a lot of our cash. But we are, like Joe just said, too, we don't have a lot of leverage overseas. And so we have a lot of borrowing capacity.", "Unknown Analyst", "So roughly how much borrowing capacity [indiscernible] business we could get back into it?", "Mark A. Snell", "$1 billion, probably.", "Unknown Analyst", "That's borrowing capacity?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes.", "Operator", "That will come from Chris Shelton from Millenium Partners.", "Chris Shelton", "A quick follow-up question. I guess in terms of the $300 million that you guys are repatriating each year, as far as uses of that cash, obviously, you had a dividend increase, which will take up a portion of that. But what are the kind of -- what are the potential uses of that cash that you see going forward?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll cover the high level and then ask Joe to add anything he wants to. As we said, really, the dividend is secondary for the use of this cash, that the majority of this cash is used for debt repayment in the U.S. And what we're trying to do is repay off some of the U.S. debt and then have some local debt established in Chile and Peru and Mexico for the projects that we're doing there so that the leverage in each of those countries has the kind of cap structure that we want to have eventually. That is the way that those businesses should be structured there. They're very underleveraged right now in each of those locations. We'd rather have local debt. We think there's a lot of good reason for having local debt in those countries, and then we'd like to be able to bring this back while we have these net operating losses so that we can repay some of the U.S. debt.", "Chris Shelton", "Got it. Makes sense. And maybe this is an Analyst Conference question, but what is the -- I guess on the U.S. side, what is that kind of desired level of debt?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we pretty much keep a 50-50 kind of a cap structure, 51-49, in that range.", "Chris Shelton", "Okay. And so $300 million a year for how many years would get you -- I guess where -- the better question is where is the balance sheet currently for the U.S. portion, I guess?", "Joseph A. Householder", "It's about 51% debt to cap.", "Chris Shelton", "Okay. So if you're repatriating $300 million a year for a number of years, would you expect to kind of use, I guess, use some of that cash in the business as opposed to sort of paying down debt because it seems like you might overshoot the balance sheet capacity?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, you have to look at too what our capital spending is for the 5-year period. And we're looking at spending something like close to $14 billion of capital during that period of time, mostly in our utilities. And so that -- and this is what we'll go through at the Analyst Meeting because you really need to look at this in terms of the 5 years, what the capital spending is, what the repayment of debt is, what the growth is in our international businesses and see it on our composite basis, which we'll show you at the Analyst Meeting. But principally, to keep our credit stats strong and all, we're intending to use the funds that we repatriate to pay off debt, and then we will be issuing other debt as needed for our capital projects to fund this incredible growth that we have with really great projects.", "Chris Shelton", "I see. And I guess because last year, you had some pretty good -- last year's Analyst Day, had some pretty good growth -- took pretty good growth assumed without repatriation, was that the assumption for last year? And now the assumption is that you'll repatriate, so are there kind of other projects incremental last year, is that the way we should think about it?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, in this 5-year plan, another year is added to it. And there are some additional projects that we will have obviously, in that extra year. But what I want to leave you with is the growth will continue in our South American businesses. We'll be able to fund that and we'll be able to create a capital structure there that are appropriate for those businesses and fund the growth that we showed you last year in those businesses, including transmission and generation projects. And then we will repatriate and use the cash to pay off debt, and we'll most likely leverage up those utilities internationally and get the cap structure they should have and produce -- and have more debt than internationally. And then the cash will be used to pay off debt here, so you're basically paying your leverage in a country where you're doing business and bringing back the cash and paying off U.S. debts.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Chris, we expect that debt U.S. ratio to stay about the same. We have really solid growth. In our view, look, money is fungible. So whether repayment of debt or spending it on your projects, right now for the first few years, we're spending more than our free cash flow. So we're increasing debt in the early years and paying some in the later years. But we're roughly keeping our debt in that ratio about the team, and we're looking at our credit statistics and making sure we have strong credit ratings.", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay, if there are no further questions then, I'd like to thank you again for joining us on this morning's call. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to call Steve, Scott or Victor, and have a great day. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's First Quarter 2012 Financial Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bruce Folkmann, Acting Controller.", "Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 3, 2012, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thank all of you for joining us today. Before we get started, I wanted to note that Rick Vaccari is with us today in his new role as Vice President of Investor Relations, which he assumed following our analyst conference. Rick takes over for Steve Davis, who is now Senior Vice President of External Affairs. If you haven't had a chance to meet Rick, I trust you will very soon.", "I'd also like to thank those of you who joined us here in San Diego for our analyst conference at the end of March, and those of you who participated in the webcast. It was a great opportunity for us to meet many of you and to show you how we plan to produce above average long-term earnings growth and support a competitive and growing dividend going forward.", "Now, on today's call, I'd like to accomplish 2 things. We'll review our first quarter financial results, and then we'll give you an operational update on our businesses. Let's begin with our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first-quarter earnings of $236 million or $0.97 per share, compared with $254 million or $1.05 per share in the same period last year. All of our businesses performed well, and we're on track to meet our earnings guidance for 2012, which is $4 to $4.30 per share. You'll note that this is the first quarter of reporting our financial results under our new operating unit structure.", "We now have 6 reporting segments, which include our 2 California utilities, SDG&E and SoCalGas. We have 2 reportable segments within Sempra International, the South American Utilities and Mexico segments. And finally, we have Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, which consists of the Renewables and Natural Gas segments.", "Now, let me hand it over to Joe so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter were $105 million, up from $89 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher equity AFUDC earnings compared to the year-ago period, driven by the construction of the Sunrise Powerlink project that is very near completion.", "Moving on to Southern California Gas, first quarter 2012 earnings were $66 million, compared to $68 million in the first quarter of 2011. I'd like to point out that until we receive final decisions in the SDG&E and SoCalGas general rate cases, we will be recording revenues based upon our 2011 authorized levels with no attrition plus an adjustment for the actual incremental costs of wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E. Once those general rate cases are resolved, we will expect to -- which we expect to occur in the second half of this year, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1 through the quarter in which the final decision is issued.", "Now let's go to Slide 5. Within the Sempra International operating unit, we have 2 reporting segments, as Debbie just mentioned. At our South American Utilities, which includes the electric distribution utilities in Chile and Peru, earnings were $40 million in the first quarter of 2012, that's up from $22 million last year. The $18 million increase was due to higher earnings as a result of the acquisition of the controlling interest in our 2 South American utilities in April 2011. Our Mexican operations include the Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal, natural gas pipelines, the joint venture we have at Pemex, the Mexicali natural gas fuel generation plant, as well as a small natural gas distribution business.", "For the first quarter of 2012, the Sempra Mexico segment produced earnings of $37 million compared with $39 million in the same period last year.", "Now, please turn to Slide 6. In the U.S. Gas & Power business, our 2 reporting segments are Renewables and Natural Gas. The Renewables segment represents our U.S.-based wind and solar business. The Renewables earnings were $10 million in the first quarter this year, that's up from $4 million in the same period of last year on a restated basis to reflect the change in accounting method for projects that we have with investment tax credits. The restatement reduced first quarter 2011 earnings by $4 million, which is $0.02 of earnings per share. As we've previously mentioned, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we are using the deferral method of accounting for these credits.", "In the Natural Gas segment, which includes our storage and pipeline assets, the Cameron LNG terminal, the 1,250-megawatt Mesquite natural gas fuel generation plant and the small natural gas distribution business, earnings were $1 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease in earnings of $62 million compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to the expiration of the CDWR contract.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Now, I'd like to update you on some of the key activities within our businesses. Starting with our California utilities. Last month, we and the other major utilities in California, filed our application in the cost of capital proceedings, seeking approval of a new proposed cost of capital to be effective in 2013. In these proceedings, the CPUC determines the appropriate and reasonable rate of return necessary to attract capital. This compensates the utilities for their business and financial risks and promotes continued safe and reliable operations. Both SDG&E and SoCalGas requested adjustments to their capital structures and the authorized cost of debt, preferred stock and return on equity.", "SDG&E requested a decrease in the overall rate of return from 8.4% to 8.2%, reflecting a lower cost of funds raised by the company since its previous proceeding in 2007. The proposal included a decrease in return on equity from 11.1% to 11%, and an increase in the common equity component of its capital structure from 49% to 52%.", "SoCalGas requested a decrease in the overall rate of return from 8.68% to 8.42%, also due to the lower cost of funds raised since its last adjustment in 2003. The proposal included a slight increase in the return on common equity from 10.82% to 10.9%, and an increase in the common equity component of its capital structure from 48% to 52%. Both utilities also proposed to continue mechanisms that automatically adjust the cost of capital until the next proceeding, proposed for 2016. The mechanisms would trigger adjustments in the event of market changes that exceed certain measurement levels. SDG&E currently has the same mechanism as Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric that propose a safeguard provision to protect against extreme changes in interest rates. SoCalGas currently has a different adjustment mechanism that is based on U.S. Treasury. The other large California utilities used a mechanism based upon utility bonds, and SoCalGas has also requested to use utility bonds. SoCalGas also proposed the safeguard provision against extreme changes in interest rates.", "We expect the final decision in the cost of capital proceedings by the end of this year, which will be effective in January 2013.", "I'd also like to remind you that for SDG&E, this cost of capital filing only covers CPUC jurisdictional assets. SDG&E's electric transmission assets are regulated by the FERC, which currently has an authorized return on equity of 11.35% on actual equity. The currently authorized FERC return is effective until September 2013.", "Please turn to the next Slide. Now, on to some of the other key regulatory proceedings. In San Diego Gas & Electric's and Southern California Gas Company's general rate case proceedings, opening briefs were filed last month and reply briefs are due in May. We expect the decision in the second half of this year, which will be retroactive to January 1 of this year.", "Turning to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Last month, the commission approved memo account to track the project costs at SoCalGas and SDG&E, and also transferred the proceeding into the Triennial Cost Allocation Proceeding, or TCAP, which is a natural gas transmission and storage rate design proceeding.", "And finally, at San Diego Gas & Electric, construction of Sunrise Powerlink is now nearly 90% complete, and we expect that it will go into operation this summer. When completed, Sunrise will add about $1.2 billion to SDG&E's FERC rate base, which includes the impact of bonus depreciation. None of the project costs are currently in rate base, but once the line is operational, we'll transfer the projects of work in progress to rate base.", "Now I'd like you to go to Slide 9 for an update on our Cameron LNG export project. We've made excellent progress in moving our Cameron liquefaction project forward. Last month, we announced commercial development agreements with Mitsubishi and Mitsui. These agreements commit the parties to fund the engineering and permitting of the liquefaction project. In addition, the commercial development agreements are the precursor to the tolling agreements and equity agreements. The project we are developing is a 3-train, 12-million-tonne per annum liquefaction facility. We have already agreed upon the key commercial terms of tolling agreements with Mitsubishi and Mitsui for a total of 8 million tonnes per annum from 2 liquefaction trains.", "This morning, we also announced that we have reached an agreement with GDF SUEZ for the remaining 4 million tonnes per annum of capacity. On the permitting and approval front, we initiated the FERC pre-filing process earlier this week, and we expect that the FERC approval process will be complete in the second half of next year. And our application with the Department of Energy to export to non-free trade countries is pending. We previously received approval from the DOE to export to free-trade countries.", "I'm very pleased with the early progress that we've seen with the Cameron export project, and I look forward to updating you in the future as we take steps towards making this project a reality.", "Before we move on to the summary, I also wanted to mention that the CPUC approved SDG&E's power purchase agreement with 156-megawatt Energ\u00eda Sierra Ju\u00e1rez Wind project that we are developing within our Sempra Mexico business. We expect to develop this as a joint venture and to start construction this year following the receipt of the remaining authorization, including those from FERC and DOE.", "Now let's go to the final slide. I'm very pleased with the results of all of our businesses for the quarter. We continued to execute on our strategy throughout the quarter and made significant progress on our key initiatives. We are on track to meet our guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share for 2012, and believe that we have a clear path to achieving 6% to 8% earnings growth over the long term.", "Now with that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to talk about the Southwest merchant gas-fired assets. Given the SONGS outage and just with low natural gas, do you have any just updates or implications for the performance of those assets or just general interest in those assets?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I would say that there has been a lot more interest generally in generation in the Southwest. There are a number of RFPs that are out right now or coming out in the very near future, so we'll get long-term contracts for generation. Some of that is associated with the ones with cooling issues, some of that is associated with looking at possible coal retirement. And I'll ask Mark to add a little bit of color on what's happening in the current marketplace.", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, clearly with the outage at SONGS and some of the other maintenance issues with some of the other plants in the region, we've had a tighter market than we expect in the -- for this time of year, and as we roll into summer, it looks like we're going to have, I would say, as we look at it today, it looks like we could have a slightly tighter market than what we've experienced in the past couple of summers. So that should have some upward pressure on pricing, but we're not -- we really haven't made any change in our outlook for what we think that business will do for the year. We could be pleasantly surprised, but I think at the end of the day we're kind of sticking to the numbers that we gave you at the analyst conference.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great, That's helpful. And then just on the LNG export, actually this is on Costa Azul. I'm just curious, are you having any discussions on possibly turning that into export or is that not really a focus area right now?", "Mark A. Snell", "We certainly are taking a look at that. It's an interesting opportunity for us. It has some advantages, as being closer to Asia and not having to go through the Canal and all that. So we are definitely taking a look at it. It isn't -- we don't have as much land there as we do in Cameron, but it is something -- we could handle maybe 1, maybe 2 trains at the most there, but -- it is something that we're exploring, but our top priority is to get Cameron online and to move that forward. And obviously, we took a big step on that today and we're really excited about it, and we think that, that will add tremendous value.", "Debra L. Reed", "Let me just add that, unlike Cameron, the facility in Baja is fully contracted for 20-plus years. And so, it's not -- for us, the priority is definitely on getting Cameron, which is not fully contracted, fully utilized and producing earnings.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kit Konolige with Konolige Research.", "Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC", "Couple of questions, kind of following on this. On Cameron, can you give us some perspective on, I think Shaner is -- I think, got their equity infusion and is kind of ready to roll. Can you update us on where they are, and what, if any, implications that has for you guys on a competitive basis?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well [Technical Difficulty]", "Mark A. Snell", "The GDF announcement that we have today, kind of, completes the circle for us. So we have all 3 trains now that we have customers for, and we're just going to work forward on moving that. And I think one of the things that where we are, what we feel very comfortable with, is our partners in this project and our major customers are all experienced LNG players that have long customer relationships with Korea, with Japan, with Chile, with places that are some of the biggest users of LNG in the world. And so we feel like we're in a very good position to move our project forward.", "Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC", "And if I can just follow up on that a little bit, can you then point out to us what you see as -- I think I know generally, but what you see as kind of the next critical steps that we need to keep an eye on? Obviously, ultimately, we need federal government approval to go ahead, and financing, but if there are specific benchmarks?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. Look, I think the things that are -- the big milestones to come forward is, first, let me just remind everybody, that we do have export capability to all the free-trade countries, and that includes Korea, which is a very big user of LNG. The next step is to get the non-free-trade export permit. And we expect to get that, as we've said, sort of later in the year, could be at the early part of next year. But that's something that we've got to get done. We also would need a FERC permit to construct, and we are working on that right now. We would expect to get that sometime later in the year. We are working on the final design and engineering, those kinds of things need to be done to get the FERC permit. So we've got a ways to go, we're just off to a very good start.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm sorry if I missed this. You were talking about the MICAM filing that you guys are -- that you asked for a waiver on, I think, and what's the procedural schedule for that? When do you think the CPUC will act on that, or whoever it is who acts on that to give you the waiver on it?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we would anticipate that since we've made our filings for the cost of capital that, that would really take precedent. And that we have had -- we have made a prior filing a couple of years ago at SoCalGas because of the impact of some of the government policy issues on using [ph] in U.S. Treasury, and that was never envisioned when that mechanism was put in place. And so when we made those filings, we had some discussions with the CPUC at the time about us filing for the cost of capital. So they were expecting us to be making this filing. So I think that we will be on the same schedule as all of the utilities, and that would have us having a decision by the end of this year with new cost of capital mechanisms and cost of capital structures going into place on January 1, 2013.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "But is there any idea when they'll actually formally sort of like say that you don't have to file this MICAM letter?", "Debra L. Reed", "No, I don't know.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, that's fine. And then the wildfire litigation liability seemed to go down, I was wondering what led to that, and what the -- if there was an EPS impact, I noticed on the balance sheet, just what the -- what was going on there?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm going to have Joe go through the numbers on the wildfire reserves and litigation.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Paul, it was mostly payments that were made. We're resolving many, many. -- we're mediating many of these cases, like 60 a month. And so mostly it was about $130 million of payments during the quarter. So it wasn't an adjustment to the reserves so much as it was payments down. There was no impact on the P&L as a result of that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And then on the liquefaction, just on the DOE, the issue of potential export restrictions, with non-free-trade agreement of company -- of countries, excuse me. Some companies have in their negotiations with shippers, put that risk on the shipper, if you follow me. In other words, it's not one that the actual terminal owner will have. At least that's my understanding. And I'm just wondering how you guys have approached that with your contracts with the shippers and stuff, if you can tell?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll have Mark go into a little bit of color on that.", "Mark A. Snell", "It's a great question. In the commercial development agreements that we have signed with our 3 customers and partners, they have agreed to a long-term tolling arrangement, which does not include an out or losing that license. So if we were to get the license and lose it or not get it, the long-term tolling arrangement doesn't have an out for that. But the long-term tolling arrangements haven't been signed yet, so there is some -- if we never got it between now and the time that we would sign those long-term tolling arrangements, it may change things. And I think the way we stand now, given the partners that we have, it probably has more to do with the sizing of the facility than whether it actually moves forward or not. I mean, we feel like there's enough of a market currently that there would be a market for the facility even if we didn't get it. But at the end of the day, we expect to get it. It makes the most sense. And frankly, the -- but the long-term implications of that would rest with the shipper. Now that's one of the reasons, too, though that we want them to be partners in the facility because if there was any kind of disruption like that, it's nice to do this as everybody has an equity interest in the facility, and we would work together to make -- to have the right outcomes.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, that's excellent. I think that's great. and then, just finally, any sense as to how much liquefaction does the North American continent can actually handle? I mean, as you know, you're not the only ones who are announcing this stuff. Just sort of any sense we should think about like the natural sort of, just economic constraints there are of just the amount of stuff we're hearing being announced.", "Mark A. Snell", "Let me take that first, and I think Debbie has a comment on it, too. But I'd -- look, it's a great question, because I think there is an awful lot of concern in the country about exporting a tremendous amount of gas. And I think one thing we all have to remind ourselves is that the LNG market, while it is big, it is a fixed amount, and we have lots of competition around the world to sell that gas to those countries that need it. And so right now, we think that there's a potential kind of excess capacity in the near term -- or excess demand in the near-term, primarily driven by Japan's desire to -- as they've shut down their nuclear fleet and their desire to wean themselves off nuclear and move to gas, and then as the economies pick up, it's probably something like 20 million tonnes a year. And I think what we're talking about is a facility that could be as much as 4 -- and then when we look at some of the other facilities, there's plenty -- there's enough to absorb what could come out of the U.S., but you're not going to be in a situation where we're going to have 20, 30 Bcf a day being exported. It's probably not that big of a market right now.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I just want to clarify something Mark said, I think he was talking about in CFD versus metric tonnes. Because when you look at the potential for export, it's higher than the 20 number...", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. I confused the numbers. Yes. But it is -- the potential is, just Japan alone is probably an excess of 10 million cubic feet a day, 10 billion cubic feet a day, or something like that. So there is some potential for export but it isn't an unlimited market. So I don't think the U.S. has to worry that we're going to have a large share of our gas supply go offshore, that's probably not the case.", "Debra L. Reed", "And what I was going to say is, yesterday, I'm sure many of you saw that the Brookings Institution published a study, and they looked at an export level of 9 Bcf a day out of that study, and showing very, very minimal impact on gas prices coming from that. And at least their approach was that, it should be open to all parties who can participate in the market. And I mean, I think that's the position we would really like to see adopted, is that this becomes market-based, we think of this as market-based, we have a very competitive facility. And that we will be with our counter-parties that we've signed these CDA agreements, and we will be moving forward with construction and export, if we can have a market-based type of approach like Brookings suggested.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with ISI.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a question on LNG. Can we talk a little bit about the cost of capital filing? Specifically, we know that you've asked for ROE at the level that you put in your presentation. But I think, when we look at the trends for authorized ROEs nationally, an ROE of 10.9% or 11% is a bit above the national average, but more importantly there are some cases pending in California, namely, a water case or 2, where it looks like the ROEs could come in demonstrably lower than that. What gives you comfort that in your dialogue with the regulators you are going to be able to articulate the facts that's supportive of ROEs closer to what you filed for?", "Debra L. Reed", "First of all, let's take a water case as a good benchmark example. If you look at, historically, the differential between energy companies and water companies and ROEs authorized, it is about 100 basis points. So an authorized ROE of water companies in the 10-range would definitely be equivalent to, for energy companies, in the 11-range based upon historical precedent. The risks seen in those businesses are quite different, and so there's always been a much higher ROE granted to the energy companies. I would also say that California have seen the need to have ROE's that will allow us to attract the capital necessary to make the kinds of investments that the State is expecting, in terms of clean energy, renewables, having the 33% renewables contracted, having the balance sheets to support that, all of the infrastructure, the pipeline safety investments that we will be making. And so, I think that, if you kind of look at those facts, I think they do support an ROE that's in the 11-range.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "My question has been answered.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A quick question on the GDF SUEZ agreement, too many earnings calls to see it, the announcement, yet, but is that also going to include a future equity investment from GDF?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The way that all the parties that we worked with and signed agreements are, we're looking at making this a joint venture, where we would have most likely 50% ownership, and they would, the 3 parties, have a sharing of 50% ownership. And all of those parties have expressed an interest in taking equity. We haven't negotiated the final terms of that, but that is what's envisioned.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And then, I guess, given the approval last month of the memo account, is any of your pipeline CapEx, has any of that timing shifted a little bit closer into 2012 or are you still kind of comfortable with where you presented at the analyst day?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We're still looking at 2012 being largely about doing the engineering studies and the planning for the construction, and expecting that the expenditures would be somewhere in the $100 million range for 2012.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Two questions, one related to the utilities. Utilities posted great quarters, especially SDG&E, and especially given the challenge of not having a rate order in hand. If we go back and look at PG&E's first quarter from last year or Southern Cal Edison from first quarter this year, both had pretty significant challenges in terms of year-over-year earnings at the utility. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers were at SDG&E, was it all just AFUDC, was there a significant change in the O&M level, and significant change in the cost structure, et cetera?", "Debra L. Reed", "The main driver at SDG&E, Michael, is definitely the AFUDC from Sunrise. That is a significant issue. What I would say though is that both utilities were trying to operate at the revenue requirement that we had last year, because, until you get a decision, that's the prudent thing to do. And so we've had a history of trying to operate our businesses until we get the CPUC decision at the level that has been previously authorized and raised.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The other thing on the Renewables side here in the U.S. Can you talk about where you see -- what RFPs are kind of out in the market and therefore publicly known for either solar or wind in the desert Southwest, I'm thinking some of the bigger ones.", "Debra L. Reed", "Mark, do you want to -- the renewable RFPs in the desert Southwest, and what are some of the bigger ones that are out right now?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I guess we wouldn't really talk about the ones that we're currently bidding on. But there are still some several fairly large ones that are out there, and there are some that have been in process for a while that people have had trouble now meeting some of the requirements, and they're coming out for additional opportunities. But we don't, probably, the numbers that we presented at the analysts conference for our fleet are likely to be what we've have been for the rest of the year. We haven't seen -- I don't think anything that would come up now would have happen at least until the following year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions in queue. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, thank you, all, for joining us this morning for our first quarter call. If there's any follow-up questions you have, please contact Rick or Scott or Victor, and have a really nice day.", "Operator", "That does conclude our conference.

Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Kit Konolige", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sempra Energy Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2012 financial results. Live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and CFO; Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Bruce Folkmann, Assistant Controller.", "Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Factors that could cause our actual result to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2012 earnings release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 2, 2012, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, I will turn it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. You may have noticed a new name in the list of introductions Rick just made, so let me introduce Trevor Mihalik, our new Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. He has extensive industry experience in the energy business and also a strong accounting background, and he is going to make a great addition to the already strong management team that we have here at Sempra. I'd also like to mention that Bruce Folkmann, who has been our Acting Controller since October of last year, will become the Vice President and Controller of our U.S. Gas & Power business starting next week.", "On today's call, we'll review our second quarter financial results and then we'll give you a regulatory and operational update on our businesses.", "Let's begin with our financial results. Earlier this morning, we recorded second quarter earnings of $62 million or $0.25 per share, excluding a $179 million non-cash charge related to our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline, or REX. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $241 million or $0.98 per share. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded adjusted earnings of $226 million or $0.94 per share, which excluded the $277 million remeasurement gain we booked when we completed our acquisition of South American Utilities.", "As many of you are aware, Kinder Morgan, a 50% owner of REX, is in the process of selling its interest in the pipeline as a result of its merger with El Paso. The REX pipeline is contracted through late 2019. The current market conditions for the pipeline are weak due to low gas prices and low basis differential. The sale by Kinder Morgan, coupled with the weak market conditions, led us to determine it was appropriate to record an impairment at this time. Joe will provide more details on this a little later in the call.", "After adjusting for the REX impairment, our businesses are performing well and consistent with the plans we shared with you at our Analyst Conference. Given our performance through the first 6 months of the year, we continue to expect to meet our earnings guidance for 2012, which is $4 to $4.30 per share. The full-year guidance excludes both the charge related to the REX and a tax benefit related to a change we've made in the holding period for the life insurance contracts we own. Joe will also discuss this change in more detail and in fact, let me just hand things over to him now to take you through details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie, and thank you, all, for joining us again. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter were $95 million, up from $71 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Sunrise Powerlink, which was put into service in June of this year. In addition, the earnings comparison was impacted by the timing of wildfire insurance premium recovery. During 2011, insurance premiums expensed in the second quarter were not recovered in revenues until the fourth quarter when the CPUC issued a decision approving the recovery.", "Moving to Southern California Gas. Second quarter 2012 earnings were $53 million compared to $59 million in the second quarter of 2011. A decrease was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses and depreciation without the usual revenue increase due to the delay in our GRC decision. Majority of the increased expenses are costs which we expect to recover in full once the rate case decision is final. Please keep in mind that until we receive final decisions in the SDG&E and SoCalGas general rate cases, we will be recording revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based upon recent CPUC decisions for prior year's premiums.", "Once those general rate cases are decided, which we now expect to occur in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012. In addition to the retroactive impact resulting from the change in authorized revenue, we also expect certain pipeline inspection expenses that are unrelated to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan to be fully recovered.", "Now please go to Slide 5. For our South American Utilities, earnings were $38 million in the second quarter of 2012, roughly equal to last year's results after excluding the remeasurement gain Debbie mentioned earlier. Second quarter earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $43 million compared with $35 million in the same period last year. The increase here was primarily due to tax benefits related to currency and inflation adjustments that were booked in the quarter. This benefit effectively just reverses the tax expense for the same items that we recorded in the first quarter of this year.", "Now please turn to Slide 6. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the natural gas segment lost $193 million in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the $179 million charge related to REX, the segment lost $14 million. This decrease of $61 million in adjusted earnings was attributable to lower natural gas and power prices, including the impact from the exploration of the CDWR contract at the end of the third quarter of last year.", "I'd like to spend a few minutes on our decision to impair REX. As Debbie mentioned, current market conditions are different than when we originally decided to invest in this pipeline, and the current market value suggests that the current book value will not be recovered in full on a present-value basis. Accordingly, we have taken a $179 million after-tax charge to reflect our estimate of the currant value of REX based on a set of assumptions using current market data, forecast of future pipeline capacity and various pipeline flow scenarios. I think it's important to point out that we expect to effectively recover our original investment in REX on a cash basis through a combination of distributions and tax benefits prior to the end of the existing contracts.", "Renewables segment generated earnings of $24 million in the second quarter of 2012, up from $4 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of solar and wind assets. As you'll recall, we now use the deferral method of accounting for investment tax credits. The change in accounting method reduced the originally reported second quarter 2011 earnings by $8 million or about $0.03 per share.", "Now please go to Slide 7. For the second quarter, Parent & Other had earnings of $2 million as compared to a loss of $27 million in the same period last year. This quarter's results included a $54 million tax benefit associated with our decision to hold life insurance contracts that we keep in support of certain benefit plans to term. Proceeds from death benefits under those contracts will be tax-free. Previously, we took the position that we might surrender these contracts before maturity and those transactions would have been taxable. As such, we had recorded taxes on the unrealized gains on investments held within the insurance contracts.", "This tax benefit was partially offset in the quarter by an $11 million tax -- consolidated tax expense, which we expect to reverse by year-end. Year-to-date tax benefit related to the life insurance contracts is $47 million, net of a $7 million income tax expense recorded in the first quarter of 2012. Excluding both the noncash charge related to REX and the $43 million net tax benefit recorded at the Parent this quarter, we are pleased with our business unit performance for the quarter and remain on track to meet our targets.", "With that, please turn to Slide 8 and I will hand the call back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Now I'd like to update you on some of the key activities within our businesses, starting with our 3 major regulatory proceedings at the California utility: the general rate cases, the cost of capital and the Pipeline Safety Enhancement proceedings. As we mentioned earlier, we are awaiting a final decision on our general rate cases. We now expect to receive a decision in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Turning to our cost of capital filings at SDG&E SoCalGas, the commission issued a schedule for this proceedings which calls for intervenor testimony on August 6, hearings in September and then final decision by December 20. The new rate set in this proceeding will be effective January 1, 2013. As you'll recall, for SDG&E, this cost of capital filing only covers CPUC jurisdictional assets. SDG&E's electric transmission assets are regulated by the FERC, which currently has an authorized return on equity of 11.35% on the actual equity held. Currently authorized FERC return on equity is effective until September 2013.", "Our Pipeline Safety Enhancement proceeding is progressing. All intervenor and rebuttal testimony has now been filed and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to take place later this month. We'd still expect the final decision on our plan by the first quarter of next year.", "Let's move to Slide 9. On the operational side, this was a very significant quarter for us as SDG&E energized the Sunrise Powerlink in mid-June. 117-mile, 500-kV transmission line is a key resource that will bolster our region's electric reliability, particularly the summer during the extended outage at San Onofre. Sunrise will also deliver a significant amount of renewable energy to San Diego, plus provide over $100 million annually in regional economic benefit. From a financial perspective, Sunrise will now move out of our construction work-in-progress account and into rate base. At year-end, we expect our rate base investment in Sunrise to be about $1.4 billion, which reflects the impact of bonus depreciation. As with all transmission and substation investments, Sunrise will earn at the FERC-authorized rate of return on equity.", "We also receive CPUC approval in the second quarter on the East County, or ECO Substation. This is a $435 million project that will boost electric reliability in the region and help in increasing the delivery of renewable power to utility customers. Construction should begin later this year and the project being placed in service by 2014. When placed in service, this investment will be included in SDG&E's FERC rate base.", "We continue to find attractive growth opportunities in our international businesses. And in Chile, we formed a joint venture with SAESA, a similarly sized distribution company, to develop electric transmission projects. The Chilean government has awarded our joint venture 2 projects as part of a competitive bidding process. These projects, which we expect to complete in 2017, will require a total investment of $160 million by the JV, and our share can be funded by local debt and cash. The Chilean government has also announced a bid due later this year for 5 additional transmission projects, which provides further opportunities to expand our presence in the transmission sector in Chile.", "Finally, let me provide you with an update on our progress at Cameron LNG to develop a liquefaction facility. We continue to work closely with our partners, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and GDF SUEZ, on the design and development of the project, and expect to complete the front-end engineering and design work by the end of this year. We are working with these same partners on completing the definitive tolling agreements, and those negotiations should be complete late this year or early next year. We are also working with our partners on the project financing and the joint venture agreement.", "On the regulatory front, we remain optimistic that we will receive the DOE non-FTA permit late this year or early next year. We've also begun the FERC permit process and we expect to obtain that permit in the second half of next year.", "Now let's go to final slide. I'm pleased that we had a solid quarter, both financially and operationally, across our businesses. While we are disappointed to have to take the noncash charge related to REX this quarter, we do remain focused on executing on our plans to derive the highest value from all of our operations and assets. We remain on track to meet our operating goals, and our long-term growth prospects continue to be strong.", "With that, I will stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Naaz Khumawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. Joe, do you mind letting me know how much was the Mexico tax gain in the quarter?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, Naaz, this is Joe. It was about $8 million and prior quarter, it was $7 million. So it's virtually -- it's less than $0.5 million year-to-date.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just can you guys talk about -- I know you impaired REX based on projected cash flow going forward, kind of once the contracts expire, what do you expect to do with REX? And kind of how do you see the pipe progressing, is there a back haul opportunity? And what can you do?", "Debra L. Reed", "Let me make a couple of comments on it and I'll turn it over to Mark to go through some of our thinking on this because we have done a great deal of modeling, looking at what we think may happen to gas markets post-2019 when the contracts expire. And if you look at how we felt about REX, the one thing that I want to make clear is because the Kinder is in the process of this sale, the way that you value REX for the purpose of assessing whether it's an impaired asset is different because they're in the process of the sale, and it's not the net present value of the future cash flows. You use net present value of the future cash flows versus actual future cash flows. So a lot of what we were looking at is, what is the timing of some of the changes that will all occur in REX, and we do believe that there will be changed flows on that pipeline over time with the development of Marcellus and Utica. It's just a matter of when those occur and what it does to that asset over time. So Mark do you want to talk about that?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, a couple of things. Look, we -- this is still an important asset. And it's a good system to bringing gas now to the Rockies East. But of course, with the development of the Marcellus in particular, as Debbie mentioned, we do think over time after our contracts expire, that flow could reverse and gas for -- will flow from both directions, then go up to Chicago and then to the Midwest, but a couple of things. Just keep in mind, one, as Joe said in his notes and I think it's important, is that we're going to be, by -- before the end of the contract period, we will have recouped all of our investment in either cash distributions or tax benefits. And from an accounting perspective, we'll still have bases left. But economically, we'll have gotten our money back, I think that's important thing to remember. And two, I don't think anybody can -- we don't know with 100% certainty exactly where -- what the revenues will be beyond the contract period but we know that there is interest in going from both directions, and we know that we'll have significant revenues. Now they may not be as good as we have now and that's what we've indicated by our write-down, but I think -- we do think this will be a significant asset going forward.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just in -- once Kinder does -- if they decide to, and then once they complete the sale, is there -- would you guys reassess the value based on market conditions, as this is my accounting failing me?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Let me ask Joe to talk about how we look at that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Okay. Naaz, the Kinder sales process, as Debbie and Mark said, led us to evaluate the REX investment. But our analysis is based on several scenarios that resulted in the fair value assessment that we put on REX. So we would not expect that the eventual sale will really reveal any information that would cause us to change any of our assumptions within these scenarios. So we would not expect any change in our assessment. Of course, over time new information could come to light, we just don't expect that to occur in the next several years.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll hear from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you just give a little bit of an update on renewable projects put in place during the course of 2012? And also what you're seeing in terms of output or capacity factor levels for some of your gas power plants in the U.S., meaning you're nonregulated gas plants?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, sure. Michael, I'll mention some of the renewables and kind of go through what we have in operation, and then what we have under development right now. Right now in operation, we have Fowler Ridge which is a 100 megawatt, our share. We have Copper Mountain Solar 1 and El Dorado Solar, 58 megawatts, and then we have 125 megawatts at Cedar Creek II Wind, which is our share of that, we own 50% of that. Right now, under development, that's contracted and under construction, we have the Flat Ridge Wind project, which our share is 235 megawatts, and that is to be put in service this year. We have the Mahogany wind project, which was just dedicated this week and our share of that is 71 megawatts, and that's to be completed this year. We're in the process right now of -- on Mesquite Solar, of building that out to a total of 150 megawatts, and we had 98 megawatts energized thus far. And that will be finally complete in 2013. And then we have Auwahi Wind, which is under construction right now, and that is a 11-megawatt wind project which will be done this year. And then we have also under contracts that we're working on construction, the Copper Mountain Solar project and that will be 92 megawatts. And then the ESJ project, which will begin later this year, which will be -- our share is 78 megawatts. And we have a lot of -- bottom line, we have a lot of construction going on. I mean massive amount of construction going on these projects. All the wind projects are scheduled to be done in 2012 before any issues of PTC go away. So they're all scheduled to be done in 2012, with the exception of ESJ, which is not dependent upon PTC because as you know, it's being constructed in Mexico and we just get accelerated depreciation on that. And then I'll have Mark talk about kind of the capacity factors, and maybe a little bit of information on what's happening in the generation front.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, on the generation front, on the gas fired generation front here in Southern California and the West where our plants are located, I think through the quarter we saw continued sort of weak gas prices and weak power prices. Unlike the rest of the country, we still have had fairly mild temperatures here in Southern California, so we really haven't seen much of an uptick or pressure on prices. We are expecting in August and September for that to change. We are seeing an uptick in both spark spreads or -- higher heat rates and better pricing. It's not significantly better, but it is better than it's been. We would expect to be a little bit stronger in the next quarter.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And finally, I know you gave a little bit of an update of this at the Analyst Day, but any further thoughts on natural gas storage development? Or any changes since the Analyst Day?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. No real changes since the Analyst Day. I mean I think the prospects for additional development on the storage side really is going to come in relation to the LNG projects that are in the Gulf. And we are uniquely situated with one of our projects, the Louisiana storage facility, which is -- which would be ideal to serve both our facility there and also the Cheniere facility. So we think that eventually that will get developed and it will be a good asset.", "Debra L. Reed", "And that facility would be about 19 Bcf when fully developed. Also as Mark mentioned, in that area, we have the Cameron pipeline that serves that LNG facility. And we would anticipate the development of both the storage and that pipeline to serve our facility in Cheniere's.", "Operator", "Moving on, our next question is from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "I wondered if you could just give an update on the cash that you are expecting to repatriate from Latin America? Is that likely to be in the fourth quarter?", "Debra L. Reed", "So we had indicated that we were planning on having the repatriation begin next year, at the end of next year. And I'll have Joe go through that. One of the reasons that we feel that it's good to wait until next year is that gives us the opportunity to see what happens with all the tax law changes after the election. And then we can really assess if anything is changing that would in anyway modify how we would do our repatriation. Joe, do you want to...", "Joseph A. Householder", "Leslie, Debbie's right. Everything she said was consistent with what we had at the Analyst Conference. In addition to that, we also still had some intercompany debt that we could move cash from those countries up to the holding company. So we were going to pay off these intercompany loans during this year, so we didn't need to actually pay the dividend this year.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "Okay. And then separately, on CapEx, are you tracking in line with the breakout that you gave at the Analyst Day? Year-to-date, I see you've spent about $1.8 billion but it looks like it's distributed a little bit differently. So I just wondered if your CapEx plans are the same, or different?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Our CapEx for Sempra is right on track to the numbers that we gave at the Analyst Presentation. There's a little bit of differences between one business unit and others, there may be more solar and then some like Humala and some other things that are in -- at SDG&E for projects. But basically, they wash and the CapEx is right on track.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And also, that -- SDG&E is a little higher in the first because of Sunrise, and then it'll slow off a little.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just -- a lot of questions have been answered -- but the impact of the REX write-off going forward, I mean it sounds like you guys are contracted. I'm just wondering how it might possibly benefit you guys, a lower depreciation or something?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I mean there would be benefits from lower depreciations but it's very small in terms of the earnings impact from that. I think that the -- probably, I'm looking at REX, that the biggest potential upside is what happens in the market post-2019 when the contracts expire. And really, how gas flows change in that region, what happens with LNG export, what happens with Canadian gas export and all of the -- and we see some real opportunities there. So -- but that's -- in terms of just the write-down having an impact on earnings, it's quite small. Joe, you want to add anything?", "Joseph A. Householder", "No, that's right. I mean if you think about the total amount that we rolled off and then the pipeline's a 40-year asset, it's not going to be that much per year. It's something but not significant.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, great. And then the other thing I was sort of wondering was the -- just to clarify on maybe insurance contract, that was associated with some benefit program, it sound like. I was just wondering what a -- if you could just elaborate a little more and that, what caused you to just change your mind in terms of how you're going to be treating that stuff, just -- nothing tremendous, just a little more clarification on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, sure. I'll ask Joe to answer that because this really came up as part of our Pension Investment Committee working with the present group, so...", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Paul, what we really did was we were studying the benefit plans, and what it really relates to is how we fund within the company, deferred compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans, and we have a trust fund that's set up to do that. And inside that fund, we have a lot of these light insurance contracts and there are investments within those. And when this got set up, it was 10 or 12 years ago when -- just after the merger, and at that time, people weren't sure how all this was going to work and felt that maybe we'll have to cash these in it sometime. But when I came into the job, I started looking at all that and determined there was plenty of liquidity, there was a lot of cash flow, we could even access these life insurance policies to get cash when we needed it. And so it didn't appear reasonable to think that we actually would collapse these policies or cash them in sooner and pay the tax on the income that was earned in there. And so we reversed that tax that we'd been incurring. We've taken the tax expense for the last 10 years on this. It was just reversing what we had booked, it's all a noncash issue.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Financial.", "Kit Konolige", "A question on SONGS. Obviously, you're a part owner there. The Commission, I think, is on the verge of deciding whether to consider what they should do about a nonoperating generating asset. What's your view of -- I don't know, just your perspective on the operational outlook, when and if it might run. And any regulatory overhang and how you expect that to play out.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well let me try to kind of put our position in light relative to Edison's position on this first. And then kind of go through what we know about that and what our expectations are for the future. First off, just to remind you, SDG&E is a 20% owner in SONGS and we are not the operator. We're not -- we've never been the operator. And our company had no involvement in designing the steam generator replacement or any of that, we basically get the energy out of the plant, then we have a long-term contract with Edison to own 20% of the plant and we get 440 megawatts. Because we're not the operator, when we went through -- when they wanted to build the steam generator, rebuild that. We were very concerned about us taking risk on long term. And our agreement that was approved by the Commission is that all of our O&M is balanced for the plant, so that if Edison asks to spend more than there is in their plant for O&M, SDG&E recovers its actual O&M expenditures for the plant. We also have an account for the purchase power, and the cost of the excess power that we're purchasing now goes into that account to be reviewed by the Commission, but it is also a balancing account. And our expectation would be that we would be able to recover that. And our costs so far during the course of the outage had been about $25 million for that. In terms of looking at the future operation of the plant -- I mean we can understand Edison's position and Edison's position is that they have an agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission where they have to make a filing for restart. And it's our understanding that they're moving towards making the filing for Unit 2 and then later, Unit 3. But Edison cannot determine how long it would take for the NRC to act on that once they make that filing for restart. And so that -- the best that we can tell you is exactly what Edison says on their call and that they're hoping to get the unit started, but that they cannot give a specific date of when the restart will occur because it's dependent upon the NRC approval. We also have a claim to the warranties for our 20% share that Edison has with Mitsubishi, the manufacturer. And we are also an additional insured on the policy that Edison has. And they indicated on their call that they were going to be filing a claim with new NEIL, or putting -- the Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited group that ensures the plant on notice. And so we're an additional insured on that policy. So I think at a high level, our position is different, we do have the balancing account on O&M. We're not the operator. So we pay a lot of attention to this because we get 440 megawatts of power from that plant, and we would like to see it come back online because it ends up being very economical power for our customers.", "Kit Konolige", "So just to be clear, is the plant -- is your 20% share in SDG&E's rate base?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Our rate base for SONGS right now is $228 million right now, it's our rate base right now. As of 6/30, our rate base is $228 million, and that does not include the CWIP and nuclear fuel and all of that, it's just our 6/30 ending rate base for SONGS. We -- again, we're a little different than Edison because if you will remember, during deregulation, we had to take all these assets out of our rate base, so we basically wrote them down to 0. And so all we have is kind of rate base buildup in SONGS coming from 2001 forward, contrary to any kind of historical rate base.", "Kit Konolige", "So that -- obviously then, that rate base figure, the $228 million, would be your theoretical exposure if there were some kind of proceeding at the Commission that resulted in exclusion from rate base?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. If -- there's a requirement that the Commission, after the unit has been out for more than 9 months continuously, for the Commission to do an assessment. And they would certainly look at what the circumstances were around this. I mean certainly, the information we're getting is that the Commission is paying attention to this but they delayed today, the OII that they're going to have. And so we would anticipate that they're going to wait and see kind of what the outcome is on this. And then they'll look at it and they'll look at the reasonableness of the actions of the parties in the case. And again, being not the operator, not any at one engaged in design of the facility, I think our position's slightly different than Edison's on this plant.", "Kit Konolige", "Very good, okay. One other area, it sounded Debbie, as -- you sounded pretty optimistic about DOE approval of the export license for Cameron. Is that any different from your thinking at the Analyst Day? I mean what's new there as far as your read on DOE's action?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we've heard from many parties in Washington that the administration is actually supportive of going forward with LNG export. And that we've heard that they would anticipate having a decision -- or the report coming out on the impacts of LNG export coming out in the end of summer timeframe period. And that after that report comes out, which I've told many of you -- I mean we have 2 reports that pretty much say the same thing, that they don't see a significant impact. It would be hard to believe that this third report would be substantially different than that. And I think after that report comes out, the answer's -- the thought is that there would be the approval of going forward of projects. I would also say that it's very interesting when you look at the actual DOE language, the DOE language presumes approval and it's the burden of proof to show that there would be an adverse effect. So the language is presumptive that export is good and that you're going to have an open market for gas, and that they actually have to prove why it shouldn't be done. And so I think what we're hearing would lead us to believe that this will be moving forward, the issues will -- it'd be the end of this year or first part of next year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Don Alley [ph] from Decade Capital.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. Just a clarification on Kit's question and one other. When you said year-end, did you mean formal DOE approval, or just the DOE report?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. We're expecting the non-FTA approval by the end of this year, first of next year.", "Unknown Analyst", "And then the -- their study on the impacts of exports, when would you expect that?", "Debra L. Reed", "We would -- I mean whether -- everything we've heard is that the end of summer. And a few weeks ago, we were expecting it be coming out sooner, but by the end of summer is kind of the official word we get.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got it. And then on Chilean JV, how large would you expect that to grow and over what time period?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll ask Mark to cover that. As I mentioned, we have the 2 projects that are in total $160 million. We're bidding on 5 more. I mean these are relatively small projects. They're generally -- and the projects we bid on are generally $80 million to $100 million of projects. So I don't see that getting gigantic. But we do have some good opportunities, we have a good partner to develop with. Mark, do you want to...", "Mark A. Snell", "Everything you said is exactly right. I -- the only thing I would add to that, as Debbie said, they're reasonably small and manageable-sized projects. It will add to our growth down there but they will be completely funded by earnings that was generated down there and in the local debt market. So there isn't any capital coming from Sempra in the U.S. down to South America to fund these projects. They'll be completely self-funded. So it's the best of all kinds of growth in our foreign entities.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our time for question and answers today. Ms. Reed, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, thank you all for joining us today. And again, if there's any follow-up questions that you have, Rick Vaccari and our team are there to respond to any questions. Please give them a call, and thank you very much for being with us today.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our conference for today.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2012 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2012 earnings release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 6, 2012, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, I will turn it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I know many of you on the East Coast are recovering from the effects of Hurricane Sandy and we appreciate you taking the time to be on this call. SDG&E has sent more than 40 employees and 20 pieces of heavy equipment to help Con Edison repair overhead power lines damaged by the storm, and we will continue to do whatever we can to provide assistance.", "Moving to our call, today we'll review our third quarter financial results and provide updates on operational matters at all of our businesses, on regulatory matters at our California utilities and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Let's begin with our financial results.", "Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $268 million or $1.09 per share. Excluding a $60 million after-tax non-cash charge related to our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline, or REX, adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $328 million or $1.33 per share. In the third quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $289 million or $1.20 per share. This quarter, we were able to grow our adjusted earnings despite the loss of the CDWR contract, which you'll remember expired in September of 2011. And I remain very pleased with our operating performance.", "We continue to execute on our strategy through the sale of 50% of our Mesquite power plant, our plans to build a new pipeline in Mexico and our continued progress on the liquefaction project at Cameron.", "Now let me pass things over to Joe to take you through the details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thank you, Debbie. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $174 million, up from $113 million in the year-ago quarter. The primary driver of the increase was a $38 million reduction in tax expense due to a change in IRS tax law regarding how repairs on electric transmission and distribution assets are treated. $22 million of the benefit recorded in 2012 is related to the 2011 tax year, while the remaining $16 million relates to the year-to-date tax benefit for the 2012 tax year.", "Also benefiting the quarter were $12 million of increased transmission earnings, including the impact of Sunrise Powerlink, which is now in rate base.", "I want take a moment and discuss recent developments in our Wildfire Expense Balancing Account or WEBA proceeding. Last month, the CPUC issued a proposed draft decision denying SDG&E's request for approval to establish a mechanism to record claims paid out in excess of our insurance. They instead suggested we use an alternative mechanism, the Z-factor, for recovery, which is the same mechanism we use for excess wildfire insurance recovery. The assigned commissioner in this case issued an alternative draft decision approving a rate recovery mechanism for fires occurring after July 2010. Similar to the proposed decision, this alternate decision indicated that SDG&E can seek recovery for 2007 wildfire costs through the same Z-factor mechanism.", "After reviewing these documents, considering the statutory and regulatory precedents and communicating our concerns to the assigned commissioner through an ex parte meeting, we continue to believe that it is probable that SDG&E will be permitted to recover substantially all costs related to resolving wildfire claims in excess of our insurance through customer rates customer and from amounts recovered from other responsible parties.", "As of September 30, 2012, we have recorded regulatory assets arising from wildfire litigation costs pending regulatory approval of $326 million. Of this amount, $292 million is related to CPUC operations, while the remainder is related to FERC operations. In February of this year, FERC approved a settlement allowing for the recovery of wildfire-related costs extended through March of 2011. Each quarter, we must determine the extent to which it is probable that we will recover costs and be able to reasonably estimate the recovery. As we have disclosed previously, any negative assessment of the probability of recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on SDG&E's cash flows and results of operations.", "If the commission fails to act, or it acts in a manner which results in a negative assessment of the probability of recovery or in a manner that affects our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the recovery, we will record a charge against earnings at the time such conclusion is reached. As of September 30, this would have resulted in an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $175 million. But to be very clear, we will continue to pursue recovery of substantially all of these costs and given statutory and regulatory precedent, believe it is probable we will be successful in those efforts.", "Now moving on to Southern California Gas. Third quarter 2012 earnings were $71 million compared to $81 million in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense, with no increase in authorized revenue due to the delay in our GRC decision. Keep in mind that until we receive final decisions in the SDG&E and SoCalGas general rate cases, we will be recording revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based on recent CPUC decisions for recovery of prior year's increased premiums.", "Once the general rate cases are decided, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012. In the event that a final decision is not reached until next year, the cumulative impact from the decision will be recorded in 2013 earnings, not 2012.", "Now please go to Slide 5. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $40 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $50 million in the year-ago period. Last year's results included a $19 million nonoperating foreign currency gain related to cash held in Chile at that time. Third quarter 2012 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $54 million compared with $47 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to improved operating results across our businesses in Mexico.", "Now, please turn to Slide 6. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the natural gas segment lost $68 million in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the $60 million charge related to REX, the segment lost $8 million. The loss in the quarter was driven primarily by lower natural gas prices affecting our U.S. LNG business. The decrease from the third quarter of 2011 was mainly attributable to lower natural gas and power prices, including the impact of the exploration of the CDWR contract which, as Debbie mentioned, expired on September 30 of the last year.", "As you may recall, Kinder Morgan, a 50% owner of Rex, has agreed to sell its interest in the pipeline to Tallgrass Energy Partners. In the third quarter, as part of this sales process, additional market information became available that required us to reconsider the current value of our investment and as a result, we recorded a $60 million after-tax noncash charge. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect to effectively recover our original investment in REX on a cash basis through a combination of distributions and tax benefits prior to the end of the existing contract period.", "When the sale closes, which is expected to happen later this month, we will receive a $41 million cash payment from Kinder Morgan related to a tax make-whole provision in the LLC agreement. This will partially offset the impact of the charge on full year 2012 results by $25 million after-tax, which we expect to be reflected in fourth quarter results, assuming the deal closes.", "The Renewables segment generated earnings of $13 million in the third quarter of 2012, up from $1 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of solar and wind assets.", "I am also pleased to announce that we are finalizing agreements with the Salt River Project, a utility in Arizona, to sell a 625 megawatt block of our 1,250 megawatt Mesquite natural gas fired power plant. We expect to receive a price of approximately $600 per kilowatt, which is in excess of our book value. The transaction is contingent on executing definitive agreements and receiving necessary regulatory approvals, and the deal should close by the first quarter of next year.", "And with that, please turn to Slide 7 and I will hand the call back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Last month, Sempra Mexico announced plans to build a 510-mile pipeline project that will transport natural gas from the US-Mexico border south of Tucson, Arizona, to the Mexican state of Sonora to the northern part of the Mexican state of Sinaloa. This project, which should cost roughly $1 billion, will support Mexico's initiative to convert more of its electric generating capacity to natural gas. We expect to fund this project entirely through Sempra International's operating cash flows and Sempra Mexico\u2019s ability to access external capital. The pipeline will be supported by a 25-year take-or-pay contract with the Mexican state-owned electric utility CFE, which will be denominated in U.S. dollars.", "We expect the project to come online in 2 phases. The first phase should start operations in the second half of 2014, and we expect the second phase to be online in the second half of 2016. This project represents a great growth opportunity for Sempra International, and will add another asset with attractive returns to our portfolio of operations in Mexico.", "Now let me provide you with an update on what we've been doing to move forward on our plans to develop a liquefaction facility at Cameron LNG. Work on the front-end engineering and design of the project is ongoing and should be done by early December. With that process complete, we will be able to file our formal FERC application later that same month. As you'll recall, we made our pre-filing with FERC in April. And that document, which was well over 1,000 pages long and contained detailed project and environmental information, paved the way for our formal FERC application. We've always planned to complete a full environmental impact study or EIS as part of our application to ensure that FERC has comprehensive information upon which to approve our project.", "The completion of the engineering work will also allow us to go out for EPC bids in early next year, as planned, and we expect to get the bids back in the second half of 2013.", "In September of this year, the Department of Energy announced that it was delaying the release of its study on U.S. natural gas export until the end of 2012. We continue to expect to receive a DOE non-FTA permit late this year or early next year, and we don't anticipate that the delay in the report will have a material impact on the overall time line of the project.", "We expect to finalize negotiations on both our tolling agreement and our JV participation agreement by mid-2013, and continue to believe that we will have received all necessary regulatory approvals by the end of next year, at which point, we will begin construction on the facility.", "Now let's go to Slide 8. I'd like to update you on some of the key regulatory proceedings at the California Utilities. As we mentioned earlier, we continue to await a final decision on our general rate cases and the current CPC calendar calls for a decision by year-end. However, as Joe mentioned, if a decision is not received by year-end, the retroactive impact of the decision back to January 1, 2012 will be recorded in 2013.", "Turning to our cost of capital filings at SDG&E and SoCalGas, evidentiary hearings concluded last month and all briefs have been filed. A draft ALJ decision is expected by November 20, in time for us to receive a final decision as scheduled on December 20. The new rates set in this proceeding will be effective January 1, 2013.", "As a reminder, for SDG&E, this cost of capital filing only covers CPUC jurisdictional assets. SDG&E's electric transmission assets are regulated by the FERC, which currently has an authorized return on equity of 11.35%. The currently authorized FERC return on equity is effective until September 2013. Our pipeline safety enhancement plan is proceeding on schedule. We continue to expect the decision on our PSEP in the first half of next year and continue to receive public comments from commissioners that our filing and past performance are viewed positively.", "Finally, as Joe mentioned earlier, we did receive both the proposed and alternate decision on our WEBA request and we continue to expect that we will be permitted to recover substantially all these costs either through rate settlements with third parties.", "Let's move on to Slide 9. At this point in the year, we would typically have good visibility on our full year results, but due to the delay in our general rate case proceedings at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we are not currently in that position. However, due to the strong performance across our businesses, we currently believe that assuming we receive a final rate case decision in 2012, our full-year earnings will be at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share. In the event that a decision on the GRC is delayed into 2013, we believe that full year 2012 earnings will be around the low end of that range. This full year guidance excludes the $239 million year-to-date charges related to REX and a $47 million year-to-date tax benefit related to company-owned life insurance policies, which we discussed on the second quarter call.", "Now let's go to the final slide. We are on track to execute on our strategy and meet the goals we laid out for you in March. Through our sale of 1/2 of Mesquite, we will further reduce our exposure to merchant generation and we will redeploy that capital to areas of the business that fits better with our long-term strategy. Our operational results were solid again this quarter, and our ability to more than offset the loss of the CDWR contract shows the strength of our businesses. We are excited about our future prospects, and I'm pleased that we continue to find excellent growth opportunities as we've done with our new Mexican pipeline project.", "With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just I had a couple of questions, one on LNG and then one on the Mexico pipeline. On the LNG liquefaction proposal, there was recently some statements made by a DOE official stating that he didn't think that the DOE would be granting non-FTA export license until 2014. And then he went on to say that there's really only 2 projects in the queue that are on track to meet all these requirements to get that approval by 2014. Can you just -- can you talk about a little bit like how this differs from -- why this differs from kind of what you're saying and that you expect the DOE will be both be looking at your filing in 2013 and maybe even later this year? Then I have a follow-up on the Mexican pipeline.", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay, sure. Well, let me address your first question and then we'll go to your second. In terms of some of the comments that have made on non-FTA permit and timing of that, there've been a lot of comments that have made in different presentations that have been made from members of DOE. I would say that one of the comments that was made was an error and actually there was withdrawal of that comment and I think it was related to the comment that you're referring to. What we're hearing is that the report will be out later this year. And that after the report is out, that there would be a comment period of about 60 days. And then after that comment period, the decision would be made regarding non-FTA. So we feel that we will be seeing that sometime in early 2013. Mark, I would ask if you have any additional comments you want to make on that.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, Faisel, it was unfortunate, but the comment that was attributed to a member of the DOE staff was actually not made by a DOE person. And it was made by an outside consultant that was speaking at the same event. And it wasn't really intended to be -- it was more of a reflection on market conditions, not on regulatory permit restrictions. And we really think it really has almost no bearing on our permit or any of the others that are being processed now through the DOE and the FERC. We expect to go forward. Yes, as you know that there has been a delay in the issuance of the DOE report. We don't expect that to affect our project. We're moving forward. We should have our full engineering study done by the end of the year and we expect to file our FERC permit sometime in late December, so with the full engineering study. So we're moving forward on this, and we really haven't -- we really don't expect this to be a big deal.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. That makes it clear. My second question is on the pipeline development in Mexico. In the past, you've talked about dividend-ing out cash flows from your South American operations and taking a tax hit up here in the U.S. through repatriation of that capital. With the development of this pipeline, does that change how you're allocating your cash flow from these international assets into this project, or potentially the dividends you're receiving back from those assets in the U.S.?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, as you will recall that we were planning, as you mentioned, to repatriate dollars back over the 5-year plan period beginning in late 2013. We're still planning to do that, and the amounts that we were looking at over the 5-year period we believe are going to be consistent with what we showed you in the 5-year plan. So we don't see any real change in that as a result of this pipeline.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So I just wanted to be clear on the earnings guidance. So presuming you get a decision from the GRC this year, which hopefully you will, your guidance at or above the high end of the range excludes REX, excludes the parent life insurance, but includes the tax benefit that you spoke in the third quarter at the utility operating companies, correct?", "Debra L. Reed", "That is correct.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I just wanted to make sure.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Naaz Khumawala with Bank of America.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have a 5-part question on the wildfire case. Sorry, Steve made me say that. So actually, real questions that I have. One is on the REX write-down. Philips also took a write-down this quarter I know you guys know that. Their write-down, I think, was a little bit bigger than yours was. I don't quite understand how these determinations are made and if it\u2019s the same pipe, is it just based on your forward projections on how this is done? And what more could kind of trigger a write-down past this point?", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure. Let me address it at a high level, and then we'll have Trevor or Joe kind of fill in more detail. What I would say is in going through the process of assessing this, is our best estimate and we consider all factors involved. There is a ROFR and at this quarter, we had information on the ROFR. We also had the opportunity to have discussions with Tallgrass and understand their kind of strategy long-term for the development of the pipeline and what they might do to change the operations, the flows on that pipeline. We did market modeling and had various models that we consider. And we did a full assessment of all of the data that was available to us, and put a significant amount of weight on the ROFR and made our determination of what we felt the value of the line was. In terms of in the future that we have to assess as information becomes available to us if that changes any of our modeling, if it changes our assumptions, if there was a sale by one of the parties, and we had information on the prices that pipeline share would sold at, whether it's a fourth sale, or if it's a really full open market sale. All those are things that are considered in terms of the valuation. And that's the process we went through and concluded that the level of $369 million for the value of the line was an appropriate level.", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "Naaz, this is Trevor. And just to kind of reiterate a little bit of what Debbie said here, again, we got the ROFR in the third quarter and so that was another market level input that we needed to consider in determining the equity value from an accounting perspective. We weighted that, that input, at about 2/3 of the value and then we utilized the other inputs that we used in the second quarter as about 1/3 of the value and that's because the ROFR was more of a level 2 input from an accounting perspective and the other unobservable inputs were level 3. And so in determining that, we came out with a fair value of approximately $369 million for the quarter. And so we disclosed that also fairly significantly in our Q.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the Mexico pipeline, just had a couple of quick questions. One is how much Bcf a day of capacity will flow on that? And then when we think about kind of returns on the pipe, should we weight them more toward international returns or more toward the utility-like returns, if you can give firm perspective on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, let me just kind of go through the high-level of the pipeline and the returns. In terms of the pipeline, as I mentioned, it was going to cost about $1 billion. And it's a little over [ph] 500 miles. We are expecting returns on that pipeline that are slightly higher than what the ROEs are that we have authorized by our California utility. So that's the kind of returns that we would expect for this pipeline assets that are contracted with CFE for 25 years. And in terms of the Bcf a day, I'll have Mark talk about that.", "Mark A. Snell", "The pipeline is in 2 phases. The first phase is a little under 800 Bcf a day, and the second phase is a little over 500 Bcf a day.", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, so 1.3 Bcf in total?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, no. I wouldn't add it together. It's a little under 800 Bcf coming down to a certain point and then it gets sold [indiscernible].", "Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I see what you're saying.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Kit Konolige with BGC.", "Kit Konolige", "So just to follow again on the Mexican pipeline, can you give us an idea then. Sounds like you will finance it at the project level.  And so what -- how should we view how much equity you would have in that business, either parent level cash and net investment or even parent of level equity that would be attributable to that? And then if you could discuss a little bit what under the contract do you get dollars that can be repatriated immediately? Or is this generating more cash that's held overseas?", "Debra L. Reed", "Kit, Let me just try to give you a very high level and then I'm going to have Joe go into our thinking on the financing. At first, I would say, as you know, that we have a lot of debt capacity still in Mexico. And we've talked about that in prior meetings. And so that we have -- are looking at all the options for the financing of this and what ends up being the best for us in terms of the goals that we have and lower rates and security and all. So let me turn it to Joe and he will go through kind of where we are. Let me just also say that we haven't made a decision. I mean, we just really got the notification that we received these and so we're going to look at all of our options there. So Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "We're very excited to have this new project be part of our growth profile and the sources of the capital that we're going to use to fund it will depend on minimizing our cost, maintaining the strong credit quality we have and enhancing our financial flexibility, and part of that will be looking at the dividend as you mentioned. And as we begin to incur significant expenditures as we start to develop this project, we'll work on finalizing that approach and let you know as we know more about how we're going to do that. But it will produce dollars, but those dollars will be part of the retained earnings and then depending on how we finance it, we'll have to look at what we do to bring that money out. It doesn't immediately just come out. It obviously will be part of our whole Mexico franchise and we'll have to evaluate those dividends. But as Debbie mentioned earlier to Faisel's question, we will be continuing with the program of about $300 million a year into the near-term as we see that go on, unless something happens here in the election and we see a different tax regime.", "Kit Konolige", "Okay. And on a separate topic then, your guidance for 2012 now, assuming that you did get a decision in the GRC by the end of the year and, therefore, you\u2019d then, I gather, be indicating you\u2019d be at or slightly above the high end of the current range. But that's with what I calculate as something like $0.15 of the tax special item or kind of onetime sort of item. A, is that an accurate way to look at it? B, compared to at the Analyst Day earlier in the year, which segments are stronger and which are weaker than you had thought at that time?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, first, let me say that the special tax item that I think you're referring to, we had the -- we're taking out the COLI, which was not a tax item. We're taking out the REX, and that's what our guidance includes. And then we had the tax item at SDG&E this quarter, which is really not a special tax item. It's an ongoing change in how taxes are calculated for SDG&E. And so we should see that impact continuing into next year, some of it. Part of it, about $0.09 a share this year was retroactive to 2011, and the remainder of it was for 2012 and would continue, subject to no other changes, into 2013. So I just want to clarify that it wasn't a onetime item or the majority of it was not a onetime item.", "Kit Konolige", "Very good. Okay. And so then segments compared to the Analyst Day, which are doing better than you'd thought and which not as well?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, if you've kind of looked at our segments, SDG&E has had a very, very strong year. And that -- when we get a rate case decision, SoCalGas will have had a very strong year. I mean, we are booking based upon 2011 revenues with no attrition at those 2 utilities. And so -- and we are booking based upon the depreciation and the interest expense and all that we had in 2011, and that, that is much higher this year than it was actually in 2011, but we don't have any additional revenues we're booking for that until we get a rate case decision. So those 2 segments are doing extremely well. Our International segment is doing extremely well, and our gas and power segment is pretty much on track with what we expected.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just another question on Cameron. Assuming you don't get non-FTA approval, what then happens? Do you only do a train or do you do -- you just cancel a project? And then I have a follow-up.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, let me have Mark talk about that. I don't think there's much of a change in our view from what we've talked about before but...", "Mark A. Snell", "No, I think what we've said publicly is that the projects would be smaller, and that means this probably goes from 3 trains to 1 or 2 trains and we'd have to evaluate that at the time. But let me stress that none of the feedback we've gotten from the FERC or the DOE and none of the -- and the way are rules are written and what we expect to go forward and the rumblings we've heard about the report at DOE, we fully expect to get this thing permitted and moving it forward. So we don't think that that's going to be a -- that we're going to have to deal with that. But if we do, we do think that there's enough of a market with our partners in the FDA-approved countries already that we would just -- we would continue to do a project, but it would be smaller.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the remaining merchant power assets, are you comfortable with the amount you have there now? Or are you still looking to monetize the remaining megawatts?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, thanks for that question. Just to clarify, our desire is to exit the merchant power business. We don't see that as part of our long-term strategy, and we've been doing that, and we've sold El Dorado. It's a utility we sold half of the plant we co-loaned with Occidental earlier. Now we've sold half of Mesquite to Salt River project and we have about 250 megawatts sold of the remaining block at Mesquite. So we are on the path to exit the merchant generation business. But as you can see from this transaction, that we were able to transact at about $600 per kW. So we're not in a big rush to sell, that we will find buyers that we can work with effectively to get good value for our shareholders from the assets.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And can I ask one more?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "In terms of the tax item at SDG&E going forward, is it just going to be a modestly lower tax rate than we've historically seen?", "Debra L. Reed", "Joe, do you want to comment on that?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, sure. Essentially, this change in the rule will allow us to continue this going forward, but we'll have to actually do the calculations after we spend the funds and see what the repairs were. And so it's a little bit harder to predict what it will be going forward, but it will continue forward and if we continue to operate in the way we are, you might consider it to be a similar kind of an amount.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just on the tax thing again, what would be the regulatory -- first of all, what was it exactly that happened? I guess, if you could just flesh it out a little bit more in terms of what the IRS has now determined? And I mean, was that unique to you? And also, just what will be the regulatory treatment with respect to your current regulatory proceedings? I mean, will this just be -- so that would go into -- somewhat would be incorporated into rates or how should we think of that?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll have Joe respond.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Hey, Paul. So this has been an issue that's been going on for a long period of time. I mean when I arrived here at the company in 2001, people were looking at this issue and the IRS was auditing a lot of companies, the Big 4 were looking at a bunch of companies, trying to do this thing, and there was no guidance really. And there was a big question about whether certain repairs that were made should be deducted or whether they actually should be capitalized for tax purposes. And so some companies have early adopted this rule, if you will, without any guidance, and they're under audit. So each company will be a little bit different here. They didn't all take exactly the same treatment at the same time. We're following the Safe Harbor guidance that the IRS published late in 2011. We had to do a lot of work to study because we had to go back to the sort of beginning of time of all of these assets and these repairs and roll forward the study. And then we had to also make sure we have the systems to implement that and carry it forward. And the -- when you change tax bases like this, not through depreciation, it is normally a flow-through item for rate-making purposes. And that's why it's flowing to the bottom line here. And so that's how it's treated for rate-making purposes. And those kind of flow-through items we always have to forecast into future rate cases.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So would it be captured in these rate cases that you're currently dealing with?", "Joseph A. Householder", "No.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then just a few quick housekeeping items. There's a U.S. Treasury grant receivable of about $181 million I see. And I was wondering, does that impact earnings? And when would we see it impact earnings?", "Debra L. Reed", "Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, that receivable, it doesn't impact earnings. It is a reduction of the basis of the assets. So when we get the receivable, it just reduces the basis of the assets that you're putting into service. And we're using that grant rather than the ITC. It's more efficient for us. And we expect to get that in the early part of the year. So the solar -- I'm sorry, some of the solar assets.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, I got you. And then with the sundry assets, I've noticed that they've been increasing over -- really actually since the beginning -- since the end of 2010 and I just was wondering, the latest it seems to be $55 million. How should we think about that in terms of does it have an earnings impact and just sort of what's driving that?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Sundry assets, the increase from the end of the year until now is a couple of different things but one of the things is we have a portfolio of assets that are used to cover our various executive plans and other things that's in a rabbi trust. And those went up in value. So those actually do go to earnings. Some of the other changes where unamortized debt issuance cost and things like that but mostly the change was the rabbi trust going up in value.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Is that excluded -- is that part of the COLI thing or -- I mean, was that in earnings [indiscernible].", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, it actually -- some of those assets are in the COLI, some of them aren't, but it's to support our various deferred comp and other benefits.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So there's like a $55 million benefit in that, is that how to think about it in this quarter?", "Joseph A. Householder", "That one was not much. I'll see if Trevor has the actual number for the rabbi trust. In the quarter, again, there was about $15 million.", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "$17 million.", "Joseph A. Householder", "$17 million.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, and then just finally, we have -- it's election day today, and I was wondering -- a real question here, perhaps not, but any thoughts about how either whoever wins the presidential election might impact you guys at all, if at all?", "Debra L. Reed", "I would just say that our history has been able to be able to work under any administration, and that I don't think either administration -- or either candidate has been very, very clear on their energy policies as part of the debate. So whoever gets elected that's one thing we'll work on with them from the very beginning of them taking office or continuing. But I think it's really not that big of an issue for us that both are very favorable on natural gas infrastructure and have made public comments to that degree. And so I think that we feel that we can work under any administration and look forward to doing that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Sorry I joined late. Debbie, any -- I mean, anyway where you can handicap, I guess, you got another 2 weeks whether we get the rate cases here or no? Any kind of feedback or anything?", "Debra L. Reed", "It's very difficult for us to determine what's going to happen in the next. Actually we could theoretically get it through the end of November a proposed decision and they could call a special meeting in December and vote it out. They haven't typically done that, so we're looking at November 20th as kind of being the date. And if we don't see a proposed decision by November 20th, we would anticipate it to be next year. And it's unfortunate that the commission has just had a lot of issues on their plate, a lot driven by San Bruno, which has kind of caused their normal schedule to lapse a bit. And it's really hard for us to predict what is going to be the outcome. That's why we wanted to give you a heads up and let you know how it would be accounted for accounting purposes. We would get our dollars retroactively, but in one case it would come into 2012 earnings and in another case it will come into 2013 earnings, which theoretically shouldn't really make much difference, but...", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So just to kind of like...", "Debra L. Reed", "And I would just add that just to be clear, we did not have those earnings in our 2013 guidance so...", "Ashar Khan", "Yes, that's what I was going to say is that if the case goes into 2013, right, then the 2013, the variance on the guidance is about $0.30. So that would mean 2013 earnings would be higher by $0.13 -- $0.30 from what you had projected at the Analyst Meeting, am I thinking through that correctly?", "Debra L. Reed", "I would say we're not going to give any information on guidance. I just wanted you to understand that we had assumed we will get the rate case in 2012 when we gave our guidance. And I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen in 2013. We will do that at the Analyst Meeting as we always do and typically we also on our fourth quarter call give you some indication. So we'll do that at that time and then we'll have a better picture on what the actual rate case outcome is at that time.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I guess just a quick question on the pipeline projects in Mexico. You've obviously hit a lot of the details on the current project that you've announced, but you said it's more of kind of a $2 billion total opportunity and that there might be some more beyond the announced project. And I was wondering, are all bids in for that remaining? And kind of how do you feel about your prospects for the remaining maybe $1 billion or so of investment?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We've looked thoroughly. There were different segments that were biddable, 4 segments that were biddable and we elected to only bid on 2 of those and we got the 2 that we bid on. So as far as we're concerned for this, the full length of the pipeline, we got the 2 segments that we had bid on. We received the go ahead on those.", "Unknown Executive", "And that's $1 billion. Just $1 billion.", "Debra L. Reed", "And that's $1 billion, yes.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "So there are no other projects that could be announced later on from this?", "Debra L. Reed", "Not from this solicitation, but obviously Mexico is doing so much to change from an oil-based economy to a natural gas-based economy, so it's a great growth area for us. But in this solicitation, again, there will be no more.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And one just minor thing. I missed your comment on the mitigation payment from Kinder and maybe around some of the timing and maybe an earnings impact from that?", "Debra L. Reed", "As Joe mentioned, that there was a $41 million payment that we would receive in fourth quarter most likely assuming that the deal closes. And that would have an earnings impact that when we took out the REX amount and kind of looking at our guidance, we take out both the impact of that and we take out the write-off for that. So as we're giving you guidance of the $4 to $4.30 range and where we would be depending on the GRC, we've taken into account the potential of that payment. And not including it in the guidance estimates.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Winfried Fruehauf with Winfried Fruehauf Consulting Ltd.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "I have a question on the accounting treatment of repairs on the IFRS.  Does it make a difference if the repair not only restores the asset to the pre-repair value, but results in a betterment; either in terms of life extension or higher quality, higher capacity or not?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm not sure that I understood your question clearly. It was a little muddled here. But I think it had to do with the IFRS and...", "Unknown Executive", "The IRS treatment of this. And really under the Safe Harbor, it just really gives guidance as to what amount of the line can actually be subject to capitalization or what amount of the line is subject to really expense based on the repair. And so that's what really the IRS is giving guidance on is even though that the repairs may not add longevity to the line or increase the capacity of the line, you're still allowed to capitalize a certain amount of the repairs and that's what this Safe Harbor ruling does, it allows you to capitalize some of the amount that we historically would have expensed.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Winfried, this is Joe. I understand what you're saying and those betterments and all those rules are kind of the old way that the IRS looked at these sort of things. What they've done with these rules is they've tried to define what a unit of property is, so they're looking at a certain number of feet or miles of pipe or in this case, a transmission line or distribution line. And if you only repaired a certain amount of that, and it's less than the whole unit, then you get to expense that as a repair rather than capitalize it. And so that's what this has to do with and it's kind of getting away from a little bit betterment language that you're referring to.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "Okay, that's helpful. The other question I have is on the largess at natural gas resulting from lower natural gas prices which impacts your LNG business, is there a metric that would allow one to determine the impact for, say, a $0.10 up or down change in natural gas prices, the impact on LNG?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we generally use for the LNG business a rule of thumb of $13 million per dollar change in gas prices, is what we traditionally use as a rule of thumb for that. And that applies to the LNG business. There's also some variability in some of other businesses, but those businesses depend on what our hedge positions are. I know they are not so easily done by a rule of thumb, but for LNG about $13 million per dollar change.", "Mark A. Snell", "And SoCal board of price was down $0.66 from what it was at the end of last year and that's what's causing this $8 billion or $9 million effect.", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll remind you though that for our utility businesses, we are not at risk for any of the commodity changes so gas price impacts are really in our U.S. gas business and our International for the LNG so.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "And this $13 million, is it pretax or after-tax?", "Debra L. Reed", "Pre-tax.", "Unknown Executive", "After-tax.", "Debra L. Reed", "After-tax.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go now to our next question from Vedula Marti with CDP Capital.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Reed, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I again want to thank you all for joining us this morning.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2012 Financial Results. A live webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, I will turn it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick. On the call today, we'll give you our guidance for 2013, review our fourth quarter and year-end financial results, provide an update on regulatory matters at the California utilities and bring you up to speed on some of our key projects.", "Let me begin with the announcement we made last Friday that our board approved an increase in our annualized dividend to $2.52 per share or an increase of 5%. This increase highlights our commitment to growing the dividend while allowing the company to achieve top quartile earnings growth. As we noted last year, we are beginning a plan of distributing cash from our international operations back to the U.S., which will result in our payout ratio being higher than our target of 45% to 50% for the next 5 years or so.", "Now let me update you on our guidance for 2013. We now expect to earn between $4.30 and $4.80 per share this year. This guidance includes our estimate of the impact from a final decision in our general rate cases, including a 2012 retroactive adjustment, which will be recorded in 2013. The guidance also includes roughly $0.20 per share related to the benefit from a gain on sale of 50% on the Mesquite gas plant, offset by the roughly $0.30 per share of tax expense related to our repatriation strategy. Lastly, the guidance includes the dilutive impact of our proposed equity offering for Sempra Mexico and related costs.", "As you may have read in the press release we issued yesterday, we plan to sell between 15% to 20% of Sempra Mexico at a public offering in Mexico and a private offering in the United States and internationally. This offering is expected to close by April of this year and is consistent with the strategy that we've discussed previously of having some local ownership of our international businesses.", "As I mentioned, this transaction is fully incorporated in our 2013 guidance. However, securities regulations prevent us from discussing this transaction until the offering is closed. I don't like the idea of having an analyst conference where we cannot fully discuss issues. So I have decided to move our conference until the second quarter after the offering is expected to close. We can then openly talk about results from the transaction and should also have more to share regarding progress on our Cameron JV and our general rate cases.", "Since our analyst conference will now occur in the second quarter, we want to give you more data today on our outlook for 2013 and beyond, and Joe will do so after he reviews our financial results for the last year. So let me hand things over to Joe now.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. I will begin on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $293 million or $1.18 per share. Excluding the $25 million after tax receipt from Kinder Morgan related to the sale of its interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline, or REX, adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $268 million or $1.08 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $285 million or $1.18 per share, which included a $50 million benefit from the CPUC's approval for the recovery of wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E.", "For the year, we reported earnings of $859 million or $3.48 per share. Excluding the $239 million impairment charge we recorded on REX during the year and the effect of the Kinder Morgan receipt I just mentioned, our adjusted earnings for 2012 were $1,073,000,000 or $4.35 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings in 2011 of $1,054,000,000 or $4.36 per share.", "The performance of our business was exceptional for both the quarter and the full year, considering it does not include any impact from the pending general rate cases. Last quarter, we told you that without a final decision in the 2 GRCs, we expected 2012 adjusted EPS to come in around the low end of our guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share. However, our adjusted earnings were closer to the midpoint of that range of $4.16 per share after excluding the $0.19 per share tax benefit for the change in life insurance holding periods that was recorded in the second quarter.", "Now let's go through the results for each of our segments beginning with our 2 California utilities on Slide 5. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $110 million, down from $158 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the CPUC's approval for the recovery of 18 months of wildfire insurance premiums in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "For the year, SDG&E earnings increased to $484 million from $431 million in 2011. This increase was driven primarily by higher earnings from the Sunrise Powerlink and a reduction in tax expense as a result of the change in tax treatment for certain repair expenditures.", "Moving now to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2012 earnings were $99 million compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was driven largely by a lower effective tax rate in 2012 due to a change in the way gas pipeline repair costs are handled for tax purposes. Under IRS guidance, certain repair expenditures that are capitalized for book accounting may be deducted from taxable income when incurred, creating a tax benefit under regulatory accounting. This is similar to the issue we discussed last quarter related to SDG&E.", "Full year 2012 SoCalGas earnings were $289 million, up slightly from $287 million last year. Please keep in mind that until we receive final decisions on our general rate cases, we continue to record revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based on CPUC's decisions for recovery of prior year's increased premiums. In the quarter the general rate cases are decided, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012.", "Now please go to Slide 6. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $39 million in the year-ago period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were negatively impacted by a $6 million nonoperating foreign currency exchange loss related to U.S. dollars that were held in Chile at the time.", "Full year earnings for South American Utilities in 2012 were $164 million compared to adjusted earnings of $148 million in 2011. The 2011 adjusted earnings excluded the $277 million remeasurement gain that was due to our acquisition of additional ownership in these companies. The increase in adjusted full year earnings is primarily due to this increased ownership level.", "Our South American Utilities continue to perform very well and grow at levels that exceed what you typically see for U.S. utilities. For the year, our business in Chile and Peru grew their customer base by a combined 3% and electricity sales by a combined 6%, and we expect those trends to continue.", "Fourth quarter 2012 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $35 million compared with $80 million in the same period last year. Essentially, all of the decrease was due to a pricing change in an intercompany agreement with Sempra Natural Gas, which became effective in January of 2012. The reduction in Sempra Mexico's quarterly earnings is offset by an improvement in Sempra Natural Gas's performance for the fourth quarter of 2012. The new agreement is a market-based contract where Sempra Mexico records revenues for the sale of the power generated by the Mexicali power plant and pays fees to Sempra Natural Gas for energy management services and for the purchase of fuel.", "Full year 2012 earnings at Sempra Mexico were $157 million, down from $192 million last year. The decrease was primarily a result of the intercompany agreement change that I just discussed.", "Now please turn to Slide 7. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the $25 million benefit of a receipt related to the REX sale, the segment lost $6 million. The cash received from Kinder Morgan reimbursed us for an economic loss that was resulting from the change in tax depreciation that was triggered by the sale of their 50% interest in the pipeline. The $6 million loss in the fourth quarter compares to a loss of $36 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement in results is mainly due to the change in the intercompany agreement for the Mexicali plant that I discussed in our Sempra Mexico results, offset in part by lower earnings from our U.S. LNG marketing operations.", "For the year, Natural Gas lost $27 million in 2012, excluding the impact from REX. This compares to earnings of $115 million in 2011. The decrease is due primarily to the expiration of the CDWR contract in September 2011. You will also recall that Cameron LNG is now part of this segment, and lower gas prices, coupled with the development costs for the liquefaction facility, are affecting our U.S. LNG business, and therefore, the Natural Gas segment.", "The Renewables segment generated earnings of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from a loss of $2 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of new solar and wind assets. Earnings for the year in Renewables were $61 million compared to $7 million last year, also driven by the addition of solar and wind assets.", "Now let's move to Slide 8. As Debbie mentioned at the outset, we wanted to give you more color on our outlook for 2013 and beyond. We're very confident in our long-term growth prospects. In fact, we believe that the long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% that we announced to you last year is very achievable with just the expected growth of our core businesses and the projects we recently just announced in Mexico. In fact, as we look at our plan through 2017, we see that about 90% of our projected earnings for that year are either regulated or contracted, giving us excellent visibility into our future prospects.", "Additionally, we have many new development activities in each of our businesses. These are highlighted in a blue box on that slide, and these should allow us to exceed the 6% to 8% growth target over time. We would expect to have a CAGR through 2017 of 8% to 10%, assuming we are successful on just a few of these additional development opportunities. And looking forward to 2019, which should be the first full year of operations for all 3 trains of liquefaction at Cameron, we would expect our growth rate from today through 2019 to be closer to 9% to 11% annually, assuming the same success rate on the development projects. We're pleased with our great growth prospects, supported by long-term contracts and regulated assets.", "Now please go to Slide 9. We also felt it's important provide you with our business unit guidance for 2013, which we have not traditionally done on this call. The table on Slide 9 provides the buildup by business unit of our new guidance range of $4.30 to $4.80 per share. The earnings ranges for our 2 California utilities include our estimate of the 2012 retroactive impact of our rate cases that will be booked in the quarter final decisions are reached. Once we have the final decisions, we will provide you with a more definitive view of the impact.", "Our U.S. Gas & Power forecast includes the benefit from the gain on the sale of Mesquite. It's important to note that we also accelerated the completion of 2 large solar projects in 2012, which resulted in somewhat downward effect on our 2013 guidance for this unit. The international business unit range includes the dilutive impact of our reduced equity ownership in Sempra Mexico and the parent line includes the tax expense associated with our repatriation strategy, which is supporting our higher dividend.", "With that, let me hand things back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Now I'd like to provide you updates on our businesses, beginning with the key regulatory proceedings at SDG&E and SoCalGas. In December of last year, we received a final decision from the CPUC in the cost of capital proceeding. That decision granted ROEs of 10.3% and 10.1% at SDG&E and SoCalGas, respectively. Importantly, the decision also granted increased equity ratios of 52% for both utilities.", "Additionally, a proposed decision was issued last week in the second phase of this proceeding, which calls for a continuation of the current methodology of the triggering mechanism for a change in the cost of capital. The PD also calls for SoCalGas to now use the same triggering mechanism as the other IOUs in California, which is based upon a utility bond index. A final decision on the second phase of the cost of capital proceeding should be issued in the first half of this year.", "We are awaiting a proposed and final decision on our 2 general rate cases. And based on recent communications with the assigned commissioner, we understand there have been some resource constraints at the CPUC, and we should expect the final decision in the first half of this year. We continue to record revenues and manage our businesses based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E. And as Joe noted, we will record the entire retroactive impact of the final decisions, including the piece related to 2012, in the quarter in which a final decision is reached.", "Moving to SONGS. In the fourth quarter of last year, Southern California Edison, the majority owner and operator of the plant, submitted a plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restart and operate Unit 2 of the facility at a reduced power level for a period of 5 months and then shut it down for further inspection. The NRC has not set out a detailed timeline yet, and we have no assurance about the exact length of time it will take the NRC to review that plan.", "The CPUC has also issued an order instituting investigation, or OII, that will determine whether some or all of the revenue requirements for the facility should be removed from rates. This OII has been split into multiple phases and is likely to take several years to be completely resolved. As of the end of last year, SDG&E's total investment in SONGS was $512 million, which includes rate base of $275 million. The remainder of the investment is made of CWIP and nuclear fuels. Additionally, SDG&E recorded replacement power costs of $77 million in 2012.", "On our wildfire costs recovery proceeding, the CPUC issued a ruling late last year that essentially kicked the can down the road on this issue. The commission allowed our utilities to maintain their memo account, tracking fire-related costs. So that we may file future applications requesting recovery subject to reasonableness review. We continue to believe that it is probable that we will be permitted to recover a substantial portion of the costs related to wildfire claims through customer rates.", "In regards to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP, all briefs have been filed, and we expect a final decision on our long-term plan this year. As you will recall, we received approval for a memorandum account last year to book costs related to PSEP, pending the final approval of the plan.", "Last week, we filed our new transmission formula rate case with FERC. This filing is substantially similar to our current formula rate and ensures that SDG&E earns no more or no less than its actual cost of service, including unauthorized ROE. We have requested an ROE of 11.3% as compared to the current ROE of 11.35%. The requested ROE consists of a base ROE of 10.3%, based on the median of a western proxy group, plus 50 basis points for our membership in the Cal-ISO, plus an additional 50 basis points for business risks unique to SDG&E. The new rate should be effective on September 1 of this year.", "Now please turn to Slide 11. Moving now to U.S. Gas & Power. In December of last year, we announced that the cities of Los Angeles and Burbank had approved a 20-year agreement to purchase 250 megawatts of solar power from our proposed Copper Mountain Solar 3 project in Nevada. Construction on this facility should be completed by late 2015.", "On our pending sale of a 625-megawatt block of the Mesquite Power Plant, we have received the necessary approvals and believe the transaction should close shortly. As I mentioned, last quarter, the sales price was about $600 per kilowatt and should result in an after tax gain of about $50 million that will be reflected in our first quarter 2013 earnings. We continue to make progress on contracting and -- the remaining capacity and are working diligently to find ways to maximize the value of that asset.", "Before moving on, let me give you an update on our liquefaction project at Cameron. In December, we filed our formal FERC application, making us one of only 4 terminals to have done so. The FERC permit process should take about 9 to 10 months from our submission date, and I would expect that we will be granted our FERC permit later this year. We also sent out bid packages to EPC contractors earlier this year and expect to get those bids back and select the contractor in the second half of 2013.", "The DOE commissioned a study that was released last December and had a very positive outlook on the prospects for LNG export. Both the comment and response periods for the study have expired, and DOE should now be in a position to review applications and grant permits. While we do not know specifically how DOE will handle the permit applications that have been filed, we are confident that ours is strongly positioned to be among the first to be reviewed and granted.", "As I mentioned last quarter, the delay in issuing the results of this report should not have a significant impact on our timeline, and we continue to expect to be ready to start construction on the facility early next year. The facility is now being designed to a nameplate capacity of 13.5 million tonnes per annum, providing an export potential of 12 million tonnes per annum.", "This increased capacity has raised our incremental construction cost estimate to $6 billion to $7 billion. The total costs of the facility, including the cost of our original facility, plus interest during construction, financing costs and required reserves, is estimated to be $9 billion to $10 billion.", "We now also expect the earnings contribution from the project to be higher than our previous forecast. Sempra's joint venture partners have begun to announce sales to customers of LNG from the Cameron facility, and we now expect the terminal to begin operations in the second half of 2017 with all 3 trains completed by the end of 2018.", "Now let's move to the final slide. 2012 was a very good year for our company, but I'm really excited about our future potential to provide strong growth and earnings from very tangible projects. We are confident that we have the right strategy to achieve long-term earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, with future opportunities that could enhance our growth profile even further. We believe that this profile, in combination with our growing dividend, makes Sempra a very compelling investment opportunity now and into the future.", "With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A couple of -- 2 questions for me and I'll get back in the queue. The first one, if you could just repeat the numbers you had on the liquefaction facility. I think your original -- if you go back to what your original estimates were and then what your new estimates were and what the increases are from the original estimate to where you are today, and I understand the higher earnings contribution from the project now that it's a higher cost project. Then I have a follow-up question for that.", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure. Let me just remind you that when we talked about the plant and the cost of that the plant previously, we did not include any of the interest or the cost that's associated from putting our assets in. So the cost that we were referring to previously was a $6 billion cost, and that was really the incremental of the cost of the facility without the financing cost and -- or capitalized interest cost. That cost now is estimated to be between $6 billion to $7 billion. And the reason for that is that in order to give a steady supply of export at 12 mtpa, our partners wanted the facility sized to 13.5 mtpa so that their actual export could be at that level of 12. And so we upsized the facility on the nameplate basis. The license still remains as a 12 mtpa export, but that gives us the ability to have downtime and still be able to export that on an ongoing basis.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then just -- I know you guys are limited on what you can say on the Mexican IPO. But if I can ask in terms of the strategic rationale behind pursuing the IPO, I think you mentioned was you wanted foreign ownership of these assets, given where they sit. Can you go into a little bit more granularity on that? I mean, is it the country risk that is an issue, or is it that you're growing the assets in that country and so you need to raise equity to fund the capital expansion in that particular area?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Faisel, due to securities rules, we are not able to talk about that. What I will say is that we are very pleased with our Mexican businesses and the performance of our Mexican businesses. But I cannot talk anything about the offering at all or the rationale behind it, yes.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to take a look at Slide 8 and make sure I understood the growth outlook, and thanks very much for the clarity that you provided here. It is very helpful. As you think about the baseline upon which you're growing EPS, as you noted in the remarks, you're excluding the earnings benefit from the sort of 2012 adjustment that shows up in 2013. Would that also exclude Mesquite? And I guess what I'm trying to better understand is what would that range be upon which you are projected to grow your EPS? Can you just provide a little bit further color on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The base that we're using, the only exclusion for 2013 from that base would be the retroactive effect of the rate case, and we're not going to quantify that amount. But if you looked at our 2013 estimate, the only exclusion that we're taking out of that for our growth projection would be the 2012 retro effect of the rate case.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, understood. So the -- in the $430 million to $480 million it does have in it the retroactive impact and Mesquite as well, or did I get that wrong on Mesquite?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, that has -- it has -- excuse me, I'm sorry. It has both the retroactive impact of the rate case in Mesquite in the $430 million to $480 million. And the range is wider than we normally would give because we have 2 years of rate case effects coming in to 2013 now because of the delay. Joe, I think you want to added a little a bit of color.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Stephen, you're right. Mesquite is in there and that's sort of a onetime thing. But we also have some onetime costs in there in the parent segment related to the transaction that we were talking about a moment ago, with our reduction of our interest in Mexico. So it helps offset that. It's not that big but...", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just if I could on SONGS. I imagine, again, here, unfortunately, you probably are limited as to what you're really able to say. But I was just curious if you had any -- as you've looked at the procurement situation and the allegations regarding procurement that are being discussed, if you had any further color on the risk inherent in some of these allegations that procurement was done improperly? Or anything further you could say on just the situation with Mitsubishi?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we have had no access to any of the reports that have been published in the media. So I -- we don't have any special insight as to what the allegations are at all. What I can say is that when we look at the facility and we look at the going-forward process, that there's Mitsubishi coverage, liability coverage, and Edison has filed disputing the fact that it should be capped. And so that will be an issue as we go forward as to how much liability coverage Mitsubishi -- or warranty coverage Mitsubishi would have. And then we've also made a filing at NEIL for insurance. And NEIL has previously covered and it is part of the coverage with NEIL to cover replacement power cost under these kind of situations. So I think this will be kind of a prolonged process of trying to get to the root issues. Our focus is to ensure that when the facility is restarted, when Unit 2 is restarted, that it's done so safely. And that is the most critical aspect to us is to ensure that our partner, who is the operator, Southern California Edison, pays close attention to the safety of the restart of that facility. And I think the rest of this will play out over a few years.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "A question on liquefaction. In your slides now, you're saying that it'll be online in the second half of '17. Does that mean that we should, I guess, subtract out the small portion that you've included in the '16 guidance from the last Analyst Day?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. When we looked at -- I think last year, we had something like $20 million or $30 million in for liquefaction. We have like one month's worth of liquefaction, so it was a very small amount in 2016. And now we're looking at it coming on -- it starting in the middle of 2017 and then all 3 trains being completed by the end of 2018.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And second question, just on the parent expense. It looks like in your '13 guidance, it's up about $40 million from the midpoint versus the last Analyst Day. What's changed on that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I'll have Joe go through that with you.", "Joseph A. Householder", "So a couple of things are occurring. As I just mentioned when I -- when Stephen was asking his question, we do have some onetime costs in there related to the transaction with Mexico, and then we have a bit higher interest expense. We moved some things between a couple of the segments, but it's mostly that first item. So it'll be kind of a one -- mostly a onetime issue, and then it won't be the same going forward.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And then it'll come back to kind of what you've guided to in the last presentation?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about capital spending levels or expectations at the utilities, both of them, SDG&E and SoCalGas, going forward 2013 and beyond, just kind of what do you see directionally may have changed since your Analyst Day and just kind of how you're thinking about whether CapEx from here grows from 2012 levels, kind of flatlines, kind of declines, just big picture?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, if you look at the big picture of CapEx that -- what we gave you at last Analyst Meeting is looking pretty good for the 2 utilities, that we spent about $1.2 billion at SDG&E last year and we spent about $700 million or so at SoCalGas last year. And our numbers for 2013 are, at SoCalGas, higher than that because we are now implementing the smart meter program, and we expect to get a decision on the PSEP. And so on the long term at SoCalGas, we gave you numbers last year of $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the 5-year period, those look like pretty good numbers over the 5-year period. And at SDG&E, we gave you numbers last year of $1 billion to -- of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which looks to be pretty good over the 5-year period at SDG&E.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. This is Joe, Michael. Do you see on Slide 8? It says $14.6 billion capital program. But not to upfront the conference because we want to have something to talk about there, but roughly the same percentage is going to be spent in the California utilities as before.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And I want to make sure I just understand the accounting for how the rate case -- the delay in the rate case impacts 2013 and whether that has any impact beyond 2013.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The -- let me just try to go through that and then I have Joe add anything to it. But basically, the only thing that was recorded in 2012 was an increase with the expected wildfire recovery at SDG&E, because we had been granted that numerous times by the commission. And so that was recorded as estimated additional revenues in 2012. Then in 2013, we would record the retro effect of the true-up of the revenue requirement for 2012 in the quarter which we get a decision in 2013, and then we would look at the 2013 amount of retro for the beginning of this year and then record that. And then from that point on, we would record the 2013 revenue requirement that we actually get, and there would not be any other effect in that -- in 2014 and beyond, other than we get attrition. And whatever the attrition mechanism is in 2014, the revenue requirement would go up by that attrition mechanism. And so we'd be back to more of a normal basis. I don't know. Joe, is there any...", "Joseph A. Householder", "No. No, that's correct.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then final item, how are you thinking now about growth on the U.S. Gas & Power business, meaning you've signed up some of the new contracts on the solar side? Just curious for your views on how much incremental solar growth, how big you want that business to be, and what your thinking is on both wind and gas-fired generation?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we're very excited about the opportunity for that business, especially integrated as the Cameron LNG comes on and some of the other assets that we have that we think will have some uplift with that. So let me have Mark kind of go through that a little bit more detail.", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay, thanks. Well, look, I think what -- obviously, the big growth engine is going to be LNG. That's the thing that's going to really grow the U.S. Gas & Power business. But until that comes online, I mean, we do expect to -- we've set a goal of about 1,200 megawatts of renewables. We're at about 842 now, and we would expect to reach that goal. We have a lot of projects under development. I think they all look pretty good. That business I think -- look, it's definitely been hurt by lower gas prices, and it's -- and lower power prices. But I think we've taken the appropriate steps to mitigate those realities, and I think you're going to see good growth in that business, especially as  LNG comes on.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A couple of quick questions, I guess maybe be a follow on to Michael's question about U.S. Gas & Power. I know with the PTC extension, does that kind of increase your appetite for maybe some incremental development outside of what you've talked about explicitly, or maybe some additional M&A in that area?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, Mark, it's -- I mean, obviously, it was -- it's a good thing. We have to be careful because the projects have to start in 2013. And unfortunately, the industry as a whole wasn't anticipating the extension, so we've got some catching up to do. But I do think it might lend itself to another wind project or 2.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess now -- like a quick question on the equity offerings, not about the offering itself, I guess, but will the kind of -- the 15% to 20%, will that change kind of your debt financing strategy significantly for this current round of infrastructure projects?", "Debra L. Reed", "We just really can't talk about anything that -- relating to any changes in the business as a result of this. So I just want to be very religious in following the securities rules, and I'm getting the signal from our attorneys that we can't answer the question, so.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I understand. I understand. Well, maybe you can -- this one might not cross any line. Is there a potential to maybe replicate that elsewhere in South -- in your South American businesses. Might that be something to consider, given you mentioned some sort of larger projects down the line?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I mean we like -- we said previously in the Analyst Meeting, we like the structure that we have in Peru, where we have about 20% local ownership. And we think it's good to have debt and equity capital in the countries where we're doing business. We think that's a very good model. And so we would look at that in Chile. We would look at that anywhere we have foreign assets which we've already done really in Peru. So Chile would be the next area where we would look at that potentially.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just a quick -- a few quick questions. On the LNG marketing operations that negatively impacted the fourth quarter, what was that, and how much was that?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll have Joe talk about it. But a lot of this has to do with the timing of cargoes that are necessary to maintain Cameron in its cold state and how those get timed in. So, Joe, do you want to?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Sure. Paul, I think last year, if you looked at last year's slides, we said there had been some like $18 million of income we made from LNG marketing activities that wouldn't recur, and there's various things as cargo. But natural gas prices slightly impact it. Some higher costs around the liquefaction development cost impact it. But we don't give detail at the segment level even, and particularly at the LNG, and we said last year we weren't going to give more details at the LNG level. But it's an operation that is in this transition, where it's moving from an asset to one that's really going to drive the business. And the size of the Natural Gas segment is going to be close to the size of our International business or SoCalGas. So we're looking forward.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So it's kind of a timing issue and not something that we should be [indiscernible].", "Joseph A. Householder", "It's a timing -- yes. It's really -- it was mostly a timing issue between years, making more in one year and less in the other.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then in the balance sheet, the sundry items. I asked about this in the third quarter, and again, it seems like it's jumped a bit here in the fourth. And I'm just wondering what was it that's making it grow by about $100-plus million. And did that impact EPS, whatever that item was or items were?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. I'm going to have Trevor, who is looking at that right now, see if he can give you an answer right now. If not, we'll have someone follow up with you after the call. He's looking.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "While he's looking at that, yes, maybe it's the Rabbi Trust or something. But while he was looking at that, I just was wondering on the LNG, just to clarify this, you guys are spending more, you expect to have higher earnings, there's some change in the scheduling it sounds like, but basically though, the ROI we shouldn't think of being materially changed, is that right? The return on investment with this increase in comps?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I said the ROI it should -- you should assume it's within the same type of range as we've talked before. I mean, we're looking -- just to give you kind of a general range, we're looking at when all 3 trains are up and operational, in the range of $300 million to $350 million depending -- annually of earnings, depending on what the actual cost of the facility ends up being.", "Mark A. Snell", "Paul, this is Mark. If you'll recall, last year, I -- at a very early preliminary stage, we said that we would expect earnings of about $300 million. That's now changed to $300 million to $350 million. But I think the most important thing to realize is the additional cost for expansion of the facility is based on, A, number one, better estimates of what it's going to cost. But the expansion of the facility, to be able to operate constantly at 12 million metric tonnes per annum, that was really a decision of our partners. And so they're asking for us to make these modifications in our original thinking and, obviously, we'll -- are paying for those decisions. So this isn't something that we just kind of came up with on our own. This is in collaboration with working with our customers and partners in the facility.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then just on the non-FTA, Christopher Smith, the Deputy DOE guy, made some comments at NARUC that have been sort of -- that I guess have picked up some coverage and what have you in terms of more caution, et cetera, with respect to non-FTA countries apparently. Any -- is that sort of figured into your estimates in terms of approvals and everything? I mean, you guys went over that in your prepared remarks. But I mean do you see any change in this, or is this pretty much in line with what your thinking was?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I mean -- I think when you look at the DOE report that came out, when you look at the fact that you've had major media all be in support of the non-FTA and then there was recently a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan with the President who urged the President to move quickly to allow the export for the benefit of Japan, I think everything -- that you're going to always hear some other side of that. But I think the momentum is largely moving in the direction of approval. And I'll ask Mark because he's actually been meeting with some of the elected officials in Louisiana who are very supportive of the project, and I'll let Mark kind of fill you in on what he's hearing.", "Mark A. Snell", "Look, I think all of the news -- it's -- obviously, there's always -- there's some detractors, but I think most of them have been identified as having some very specific self-interest. I think the vast majority of the reports that are coming out and the people that we talked to are supportive of the -- of exports. But I think what's most important and direct to your question, we expect to get the FTA approval this year. We actually expect to hopefully to get it in the first half of the year, but irrespective of when we get it this year, it isn't changing our schedule at all. We're moving forward on our plans. We've -- we're -- it's really not affecting our timing any -- as long as we get it this year, we'll be fine. So I think that's the important thing is it's not affecting our timing, and we very much expect to get it this year.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And the sundry items, did you guys come up with an answer yet or?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, yes.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, Paul, we have an answer. I like your detail orientation. For that $150 million increase, only about $31 million of it is really P&L related, which is, as you mentioned, the Rabbi Trust that we talked about last time, which is going up in value as the stock market increases. We also contributed some funds to that, which was about $40 million. And then there was about $20 million of line to credit fees that got put in there, and those get amortized over time. And then we had sort of a gross up of some workers' comp activity, where we put something into that account and also put a liability, kind of grossing up the balance sheet. But really, the only thing that went through the P&L is about $31 million of earnings from the Rabbi Trust.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Is that pretax? Is that after tax?", "Joseph A. Householder", "That's a pretax number.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "That's a pre-tax number.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Debbie, going back to your remarks, pretty comprehensive in terms of questions. Once we get the rate case decision, can we expect then in the following quarter that you tighten the guidance for the year?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, the -- what we would plan to do is once we get that decision, look at it, and we would most likely tighten the guidance range at that time, once we've had the chance to have a final decision and analyze it. I think that, yes, that's where we're headed right now is to be able to do that.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "Just to clarify, on the LNG, you're saying ROI will be the same. And it's going to be $300 million to $350 million of earnings, and that's kind of pro rata to what it would have been at 12 and then going to 13 7, so the math works. I just want to confirm that all those numbers are correct.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. It's more related to the cost than it is to the size. But yes, you're on the right track.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "Okay. And then one question on utilities. The benefit from putting 2012 rate case into 2013, how much is that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We're not going to give that type of level of detail. It's in our guidance, and we've done our estimate in our guidance, and we'll let you do your own estimate.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "Is there anyway to glean from in 2012 how much the fact that you didn't get the rate case impacted earnings? Is that maybe a question you can answer or?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. I really can't go there. I think you saw our 2012 results. You saw what we had told you in 2012, originally. And if you want to come up with an estimate, I think you can -- you have the kind of the numbers that we have to come up with an estimate.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take a follow-up question from Faisel Khan from Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a few more questions. Do you guys have a CapEx number for 2013? It seems, directionally, looking at the projects that you guys built out last year and the year before, it looks like that number is coming down this year. But if you could give us some details on that, that'd be great.", "Debra L. Reed", "I have -- I don't know that I have that now to give. We will definitely give you that at the Analyst Meeting when we do that later this year. But it was pretty -- all I can say is it's pretty consistent...", "Joseph A. Householder", "It'll be very consistent with last year.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, with last year and last year's plan that we gave you. So nothing that is a significant change to last year -- last year's plan.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So even with the powering up of Sunrise and I guess some of the reduction in capital in Renewables, you still expect the CapEx to remain...", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, let me just -- remember, at SoCalGas is where we're really starting to spend some money now. And then in Mexico, we just received the $1 billion worth of the pipeline, the 2 pipelines and then another project in the JV with Pemex. And so the total CapEx is not occurring so much in the Renewables space, but that's been now -- had a move to our utility at SoCalGas and then our business in Mexico.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then for U.S. Gas & Power, what kind of assumptions are you guys using for the remaining component of your generation portfolio in terms of capacity factors and spark spreads?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, again, we just use the forward curve on gas. And I don't know that we've ever disclosed what the capacity factors are, but it's a nominal effect on earnings.", "Debra L. Reed", "And just remember, not only do we have the 625-megawatt block that sold, but then we've also sold another block starting in 2015. That's 241 megawatts. So we got down to where we own a very small portion...", "Mark A. Snell", "Right.", "Debra L. Reed", "Of that facility. And then it hedged, over the next couple of years, close to that 241 megawatts that we sold-forward starting in 2015 for 25 years. So there's not as much. We've done what we told you we were going to do, and we've reduced significantly any of our market exposure to the Mesquite Power Plant, so.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then just -- there's a project that it looks like it's trying to move forward to build an oil pipeline from the Permian Basin into Los Angeles, and some of that traverses along a pipeline that you guys bought from Questar. I was wondering if you guys had any interest, or are you looking at participating in something along those lines or in a project like that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I think it's funny because we bought that project from Questar and converted it to a natural gas pipeline because we needed it to reinforce our system. I mean, we have not done anything actively on that. We are aware of the project. We'd have to look at the provisions of our rights of way and all of those issues to see if there was anything that we could do in partnership. But it hasn't been something that we've been focused on greatly.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question for me, on the cash flow statement. It looks like the last 2 years, you had a working capital drain, $225 million in '11 and $630 million in '12. And I was wondering, does that reverse, or is there some sort of permanent reduction in working capital that's a drag on cash flows?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. I'm going to turn that over to Joe and Trevor to see the reconciliation on the cash flows.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Trevor, you want to answer that?", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "Yes. Faisel, your question specifically relates to?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes. So in 2012, the negative working capital outflows of $630 million, and then in '11, you also had a working capital outflow of $224 million. So I'm just trying to match operating cash flow.", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "Right. Primarily those -- there's -- those working capital outflows are the reg balancing accounts, as well as the wildfire payments that we received in 2012. That's almost $400 million that came in. So there's an adjustment there.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Very significant portion of it, Faisel, is regulatory balancing account changes coming in and out.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, thank you, all, for joining us today. We -- if you have any follow-up questions, whatsoever, please feel free to call Rick or Victor. And thank you very much, and we will see you at an analyst conference soon to be scheduled. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's First Quarter 2013 Financial Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual result to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC.", "It is important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 2, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to Slide 3, and let me hand it over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. During the first quarter, we completed 2 significant transactions that further our strategy.", "First, we closed the sale of 1 block of the Mesquite Power Plant for about $600 per kilowatt, which further reduces our exposure to merchant generation consistent with our plan. Second, we completed an extremely successful initial public offering of equity in our Mexican subsidiary, which was preceded by an issuance of over $400 million of local debt. This is consistent with our strategy to create capital structures in our international businesses that allow them to grow with local debt and equity. The success of our Mexican transactions recognizes the value that we are creating in our Mexican business. In fact, the increase in the IEnova stock price places our 81% stake at roughly equal to the total equity market cap based on the IPO price. The stock performance since the offering clearly demonstrates the high value that investors place on this business and allows our investors to use this as a reference to determine what our Mexican segment is worth.", "This quarter, we also received a long-awaited proposed decision in the General Rate Case at our California utilities and a final decision on this case should be voted out soon. And finally, we continue to make progress during the quarter on our key projects, including Cameron Liquefaction, where we received a definitive schedule from FERC on their approval process.", "We will now go through each of these items in more detail after we discuss the financials. But before doing so, I would like to turn to Slide 4.", "There was a lot going on in our reported earnings this quarter, and I want to share with you some of the issues that are included in earnings that caused us not -- to not meet your quarterly expectations. Slide 4 lists a number of items from the first quarter, all of which are either onetime in nature or will turn around before year-end. This list includes: the gain on the sale of 1 block of the Mesquite Power Plant; a deferred tax charge related to the IEnova IPO; an impairment on our holdings in Argentina in anticipation of the sale by year-end; a reduction in our renewable grant receivable due to the federal budget sequestration; mark-to-market losses due to higher gas prices, which should reverse by the end of the year; and adjustment to our consolidation tax expense, which is expected to reverse by year-end; and natural gas transition integrity costs in excess of amounts currently recovered in way that will be balanced under the proposed decision in our GRC.", "Of course, one of the most significant issues impacting our performance is the continued delay in a final decision in our 2012 General Rate Case at SDG&E and SoCalGas. And as I mentioned, we will discuss this in more detail a little later. We hope this table helps you reconcile our reported earnings to your projections.", "And now let me hand things over to Joe to further discuss our financial performance during the first quarter, beginning with Slide 5.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $178 million or $0.72 per share. This compares to earnings of $236 million or $0.97 per share in the same quarter last year.", "As Debbie just mentioned, this quarter's earnings were impacted by a number of issues, including the continued delay in the final decision of our General Rate Case and a onetime $63 million deferred tax charge incurred as part of our initial public offering of our Mexican operations.", "As a result of recording the tax related to the IEnova IPO in the first quarter, we will be able to now quickly distribute to the U.S. parent about $200 million due to the taxable income associated with the IEnova transaction. Since we can bring this cash back earlier than originally forecasted in this year, we have decided to defer any further repatriation until 2014 when we will continue with our planned repatriation of approximately $300 million per year.", "While we did receive a proposed decision in our utility General Rate Case in the first quarter, we will not update our guidance for 2013 until we receive a final decision. The draft decision is on the CPUC's agenda for May 9, and assuming it is voted out on that day, we intend to provide an update to our guidance at our Analyst Conference on May 23.", "We would expect to see some changes in the PD based upon the process Commissioner Ferron has put into place, and Debbie will discuss the key issues a little later on the call. However, if the current PD is adopted as written, we would expect to be at the low end of our 2013 guidance range of $4.30 to $4.80 per share.", "Now let's go through the results for each of our segments in detail, beginning with our 2 California utilities on Slide 6. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter of 2013 were $91 million, down from earnings of $105 million in the first quarter of 2012. Southern California Gas first quarter 2013 earnings were $46 million compared to earnings of $66 million last year. Earnings were lower at both California utilities, primarily due to higher operating expenses, including depreciation with no increase in authorized revenue due to the delay in our 2012 GRC decision. We have now operated since 2011 with no increase in our revenue requirement as we await the final decision in the GRC.", "The first quarter results at SoCalGas were adversely impacted by $4 million related to the after-tax effect of natural gas transmission pipeline system integrity program cost, which exceed the amount currently being recovered in rates. Once the GRC decision is final, the excess cost for this program incurred since the beginning of 2012, will be balanced and all cost will be recovered in rates.", "Additionally, as a result of the cost to capital decision, our revenue was reduced to reflect our actual embedded cost of long-term debt, which is lower than what was previously being recovered in rates. This true-up negatively impacted earnings by approximately $5 million at SDG&E and $3 million at SoCalGas in the first quarter of 2013, and we expect a similar impact throughout the remainder of the year.", "Finally, SDG&E's first quarter earnings were positively impacted by higher transmission earnings, while SoCalGas earnings in the first quarter of last year included $4 million related to incentive awards associated with the Gas Cost Incentive Mechanism. We anticipate a similar GCIM award to be recorded by SoCalGas later this year once it is approved by the CPUC.", "I am cautiously optimistic that this is the last quarter I have to say this, but please keep in mind that until we receive a final decision on our General Rate Case, we continue to record revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based on recent CPUC decisions for recovery of prior years' increased premiums. In the quarter the General Rate Case is decided, which we now expect will be the second quarter of this year, we will record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012.", "Now please move to Slide 7. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $37 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to earnings of $40 million in the same period of 2012. We recorded higher earnings from operations at our businesses in Chile and Peru, but this was more than offset by a $7 million impairment charge related to our investment in 2 Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. We continue to actively pursue the sale of these investments, and we expect to dispose of them by the end of the year.", "First quarter 2013 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $31 million versus earnings of $33 million in the first quarter of last year. The small decrease is due primarily to a minority interest from the IEnova IPO.", "Now please turn to Slide 8. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $53 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $1 million in the year ago period. This quarter's earnings include the $44 million gain net of related expenses from the sale of 1 of the 2 blocks of our Mesquite Power Plant. The increase in earnings for the quarter was also due to $9 million of higher earnings from our U.S. LNG business due to the timing of cargo marketing operations. These increases were offset by $10 million of higher mark-to-market losses related to movement in gas prices.", "In the first quarter of 2013, mark-to-market losses were $12 million, which we expect to reverse by the end of the year.", "The Renewables segment generated earnings of $4 million in the first quarter of 2013, down from earnings of $10 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease is primarily driven by 2 factors. First, due to the federal government sequestration, there's been a reduction of 8.7% in the amount of cash grant awards to be paid by the U.S. Treasury. This resulted in a $23 million decrease in our cash grant receivable and a reduction in earnings of $5 million this quarter. Second, there were tax benefits related to the completion of solar assets placed in service in 2012. The decrease in earnings was partially offset by higher levels of production tax credits from our wind assets, many of which were placed into service in late 2012.", "Now let me hand the call back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. We have talked about our intent to optimize our capital structure in our international business unit, and I am pleased that we took a big step in that direction last quarter through extremely successful debt and equity offering at our Mexican subsidiary. That subsidiary, previously called Sempra Mexico, now IEnova, raised nearly $1 billion of external capital during the first quarter.", "In February, we had 2 successful debt issuances at IEnova that raised a total about $400 million at very attractive terms. In addition to raising capital, the debt offering helped educate investors about our Mexican operations. And the strength of the balance sheet at IEnova allows for further leverage as we continue to grow.", "Then in March, IEnova sold almost 19% of its equity at a value of around 10x to 11x 2013 expected EBITDA under IFRS. The demand for this offering was tremendous. IEnova is the second-largest energy company in Mexico and the first energy company to be listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. The strong demand allowed us to create a shareholder base, which is comprised of a broad group of Mexican and international investors, with the majority coming from Mexico, further bolstering IEnova's position in that market.", "Please turn to Slide 10. Even with pricing at the top of the published valuation range for the offering, the market has shown continued enthusiasm for IEnova as the stock is up 22% since the IPO. When we launched the IPO, the implied valuation for IEnova was around $3 billion. And today, that is about $4 billion. As you can see from the chart on the left, our 81% holding in IEnova is worth nearly double today what our book value in those assets was at the end of 2012. This is great for Sempra shareholders as it provides transparency into the value the market ascribes to our Mexican subsidiary and allows IEnova to continue growing without the need for additional Sempra capital.", "Both the debt and equity transactions in Mexico represent an important step in optimizing our international capital structure. And since all 3 of our international businesses have substantial ability to increase leverage to fund growth projects, we will continue to look for future opportunities.", "Let's go on to Slide 11. In March, we received a proposed decision in the General Rate Case for our 2 California utilities. The proposed decision authorizes a revenue requirement for 2012 of $1,749,000,000 and $1,952,000,000 for SDG&E  and SoCalGas, respectively. This represents respective growth of 8% and 6% over currently authorized levels. The decision also establishes a 4-year GRC period through 2015, subsequent escalation of the adoptive revenue requirements for 2013 through 2015 using the Consumer Price Index and the continuation of the Z-factor mechanism for qualifying cost recovery.", "While there were some positives in the proposed decision such as the capital requirement level that are generally in line with our request, we filed a comment on the proposed decision last month requesting a few significant changes. First, these changes aim to address certain inconsistencies between our PD and prior CPUC General Rate Case decisions. We strongly believe that all California utilities should be treated equally from a policy perspective on routine issues such as attrition mechanism and employee compensation.", "The most significant inconsistency between the Edison decision that was voted out unanimously just 4 months ago and our proposed decision relates to the attrition mechanism, which calls for the use of the CPI-Urban index. This index does not reflect the true escalation in costs that a California utility faces, and based on historical trends will provide SDG&E and SoCalGas annual revenue increases that are about 1% lower than what the commission adopted in all recent rate case decisions.", "Another major inconsistency relates to the proposed amount of ratepayer funding of our employee compensation plan. Our PD calls for ratepayer funding of only 50% of our performance-based compensation, while there have been recent CPUC decisions approving 90% of the same. Given the CPUC's own employee compensation study affirm that our total compensation, which includes performance-based compensation, is at market level, we don't believe it makes sense for our ratepayer funding to be reduced as the record in the rate case clearly support full funding.", "We also recommended changes that help to ensure both SoCalGas and SDG&E have sufficient funds to maintain safe and reliable operations and continue providing the level of service our customers expect and deserve. The need for changes in the PD is most acute at SoCalGas where the proposed decision reduced funding for critical operations that are required for that company to do basic work, such as leak detection and locate and mark services. We think it is highly unusual, given its focus on safety, that the commission would choose to reduce funding in these core services. We have made our concerns known, and we expect that with a better understanding of the fact, most, if not all, of this funding will be reinstated in the final decision.", "Commissioner Ferron has acknowledged that some errors were made in the PD. He has put in place a transparent process to allow parties to address their concerns for the proposed decision and we have made our case for improvements. We expect him to do the right thing and make the appropriate changes.", "We anticipate that a final decision will be reached on the GRC in the second quarter, and as Joe noted earlier, we hope to be able to provide an update to our financial guidance that reflects the outcome at our Analyst Conference on May 23.", "Let's now go on to Slide 12. Turning to our efforts to develop liquefaction at our Cameron facility, last month, FERC issued a notice of its schedule for the environmental review of the project. Cameron is the first and only proposed LNG export application currently pending before FERC to have reached this milestone in the permitting process. Based on the published schedule, the final environmental impact statement will be released in November 2013 and the final application should be approved by early 2014. The DOE non-FTA permit is, of course, the other major outstanding permit we require and we continue to expect to receive it in 2013.", "FERC's decision to release the schedule shows the relative strength of our project, and we continue to believe that Cameron is well positioned to be among the first applications that DOE reviews and approves. With the timing of these regulatory approvals in mind, the project remains on schedule to start construction next year and begin operations in the second half of 2017.", "On the commercial front, we are nearing completion of the tolling and JV agreements with Mitsubishi, Mitsui and GDF SUEZ. We expect that those agreements will be signed later this month, and I expect we will have much more to say on this at our Analyst Conference.", "Now please turn to Slide 13. In summary, we took a number of key steps forward during the first quarter in achieving our long-term goals. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Conference on May 23 in New York where we will discuss our goals and overall strategy in significantly more detail.", "With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Faisel from Citi. On IEnova, just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what your plans are kind of going forward for your participation in the entity. Meaning that you have roughly 80% right now and if the company raises more equity in the future to grow the business, will you maintain your 80% stake or will you let that kind of float down?", "Debra L. Reed", "I would say, first off, we really like this business and the reason that we wanted to do the IPO was so that we could grow the business. And so I think, at this point, we're very -- we like what we have in both Mexico now and Peru with an 80% ownership, that we feel that that's a good share balance with having local ownership and local debt plus our 80% ownership. And we haven't really thought of anything beyond keeping that kind of structure. I'm going to Mark and Joe, because they were part of the road tour on this, to add any comment.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, Faisel, this is Mark. We don't have any current plans to reduce our ownership below where our current -- where it is. And I think if you look at what we've done in Peru over the years, it mimics the ownership structure that we have down there. And I think we're pretty satisfied where it is. We have a lot of great projects on the horizon for IEnova. But the good news is, is that we still have quite a bit of debt capacity. So it is -- into the foreseeable future, we don't really see it changing.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Faisel, this is Joe. I'll just add on to that, and I know there are probably people on the call that participated in the road show and I know many of the names I saw. What I said when I was asked this question many times is, just as Debbie and Mark said, that we don't have any plans to sell down. We probably would never sell any of our shares. And as Mark said, we have plenty of debt capacity. But the growth there is tremendous. And if they continue to grow at this pace and they need to raise more equity, I think we would let them though that. We would have to determine at that time whether we want to participate or allow ourselves to be diluted a little bit. But as Debbie said, we really like the business and our stay in it.  On the other hand, we've always said we like the size of our international business, around 30%, 1/3 of Sempra's overall structure. So as we continue to grow our U.S. business, we get Cameron in, we can have more international earnings. But if IEnova can grow -- I mean, somebody asked me on the road show, can IEnova be bigger than Sempra? I said, I hope so. So we'll see.", "Mark A. Snell", "I would say this. I don't think that we would see -- we would expect that our earnings share from IEnova over the years will grow. No matter what our ownership percentage is, our share of earnings will grow.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Absolutely.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. It makes sense. And then, Debbie, can you give us an update on the ROE case filed for the power -- electric transmission assets?", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure. We made our filing at FERC and we'd used the FERC-prescribed methodology, contrary to some of the other cases that had been in the news. We used the FERC-prescribed methodology, which takes the median of your peer group of electric utilities. And we did that under 4 different methodologies that we filed at FERC. That came out with a 10.3% as kind of your base ROE. And then we added to that the allowance of 50 basis points for being part of an ISO and 50 basis points for our utility's specific risk. And, as you know, in California, we have things like the debt equivalency for the power contract and things like that, that FERC has looked at as being -- had a utility-specific risk to consider. So we made a filing off 11.3, the rate should go into effect on September 1. And we'll wait and see what the outcome, but we do feel we followed their methodology.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "When do you expect an outcome from the FERC?", "Debra L. Reed", "September 1.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "September 1. Okay, got you. Yes, last question from me. Where are you right now on the FEED for the Cameron facility?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we have the engineering work underway. We actually are in the process of selecting between -- there's 2 parties, 2 contracting groups that are bidding for the EPC. And we that have a pretty well-developed FEED that they can bid on. And then we'll do all the detailed engineering after that. We would expect to select our contractor by the end of this year. And would again, expect to begin construction next year. Mark, you want to?", "Mark A. Snell", "No, I think you hit all the points. We have a well-developed FEED and it'll get enhanced. But it's out for bid now. So we'll have EPC contracts at the end of the year.", "Operator", "And next we'll hear from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "I had a couple questions. Just on that transmission issue. I thought FERC recently, or at least staff [ph] has been pushing single utilities to use a midpoint, not a median, and then if you're in an ISO or RPO, you can get a median?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. Well, we are in an ISO, and the FERC rules for an ISO is you use the median. And where there have been some issues is when utilities have not followed what the rules are for what their structure. We're an ISO. We're supposed to use the median of the peer group. And then we do 4 different studies using different economic modeling mechanisms of what the ROE comes up under those studies, and that's what we submitted to FERC.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. Switching gears to the -- just a clarification, the tax expense on the IEnova transaction, you're keeping that in -- that's part of your ongoing guidance for this year, the $0.25?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "But then you're not going to be repatriating the other -- the annual money that was typically about $0.30 hit every year?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we will repatriate starting next year. But because we had the -- already paid taxes on this and we can bring the $200 million back in the very near future, then we didn't see a need to bring back -- if you look at our cash balances, our cash flow statement, it's very, very strong. And so it just didn't seem to make a lot of sense for us to do additional repatriation this year.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And I'd just add on to that, Steven. She said we already paid tax. Actually, we're not going to pay the tax for 4 or 5 years because of the NOL, but we incurred the expense on the books.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. And then just at the year end, when you reported you had that slide with the kind of growth rates off of the base, et cetera. I mean, is all that slide all still relevant in terms of the different growth rates?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well -- yes. I mean there's nothing in terms of our projects and the fact that we have all these projects that we have underway that the majority of them already contracted or part of the utility, that would change in that slide. What we will do is if we can get a final decision in the rate case and enough time to analyze before the Analyst Meeting, then we will give you an update to that at that time. And we'll give you new guidance numbers and new ranges. Without having a final rate case decision, we sure wish we were not in this situation either. It's gone on a long time, and we'd like to be able to give you more than that. But hopefully, by the time of the Analyst Meeting, as I said, that this is on the agenda for a vote of our final rate case on May 9 and so if it comes out then, we should be able to give you all of that at the Analyst Meeting in a few weeks.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay, and just -- but, in theory, the -- to some degree, the GRC just also just sets the base and then the growth rate?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. And that's what -- the growth rate that we showed you, I mean, I don't see anything substantively different in the growth rates that we showed you. But we want to give you better guidance on the range for this year that begins the growth rate and then what that ends up being at the end of the period of time. And we're just not able to do that absent a rate case. I wouldn't ignore all what we gave a before. I just think we would like to further refine that for you at the Analyst Meeting.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay, and one more question, different topic. The DOE non-FTA approvals, what's your sense on the order, essentially the order of the queue at this point and when you think they'll rule on you, on Cameron?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, a couple of things. I'm not so sure that there's going to be a queue where 1 project is going to come right after another. It may be very well that the decision is to take a group of projects that have -- are under the level that was in the study that was done last year. And that, that study, I think, went up to 10 Bcf of export and so we think that we are in good place in the queue. We're the only facility that is in the FERC process and that usually tends to be -- that tends to be the critical path is getting that FERC approval. And so we have some dates. [indiscernible] went out with come forward [ph]. But I don't know that the queue is going to come out one by one. If you did that, I think we're #4 or #5 in that queue. But we also think that there's a possibility that they may approve a number of projects all at one time.", "Mark A. Snell", "I was just going to say, I think when we talk about the queuing order, let's just remind ourselves that that's the queuing order in which the applications were filed. And while they've indicated that, that will place some bearing on it, it isn't necessarily so that that's going to be the order. We don't know that.  But I do think that all of the feedback that we're getting out of Washington, all of the things that we're hearing that we believe our project and the other brownfield projects are likely to be approved.", "Debra L. Reed", "This year.", "Mark A. Snell", "This year and we continue to believe that. We haven't heard anything contrary to that. And I will say that there is nothing on the record at the DOE that would indicate that they shouldn't approve these projects. I think that's an important point to remember. There's been no real record made of any reason not to approve them. So I suspect that they will get approved. And we're confident that it's going to happen.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I would add to what Mark just said too. Monis [ph] who is in the confirmation to head up the agency, made very clear that as the Natural Gas Policy Act stands today, you really have to make a case as to why they shouldn't be approved. The burden of proof is on the other party. So the relevance of what Mark is saying is that someone has to come in and make the case as to why these projects are not in the public good. Everything that's come out has shown that these projects are in the public good and Monis [ph] commented on that during his confirmation period.", "Operator", "And now, we'll take a question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just thought I'd check in on the overall commercial arrangements. You mentioned fairly soon you'll have tolling and JV agreements in place in Cameron. And I just wanted to check to make -- to see if there's any evolution of your thinking on the commercial terms or the nature of the partnership that you're seeking to form in terms of capital commitment, in terms of degree of risk you're willing to bear, just in general without going into too much specifics.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I would say what we told you is the way that it's absolutely heading, which is that we would be committing our existing facility as our equity contribution. And that ourselves and our partners would then form a joint venture and that the joint venture would finance about 70% of the project. And each of the partners would then put in additional equity. And then depending on what the project costs, there may be some additional requirements for equity, but we would anticipate that to be funded largely via the income from the trains as they each come on. So I mean, that's the structure. There's nothing that we're seeing that would change in that structure. Mark, you want to...", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, the only thing I would say is the sort of the broad parameters that we laid out last year at our Analyst Conference, those are all still roughly the same and we've marched along to that. There isn't anything that's coming up in the JV structure, the tolling structure that's significantly different than what we anticipated. And then we'll give you an update at the Analyst Conference, but I don't expect that anybody will be surprised by anything.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And so it sounds like there's nothing in relation to that, that would prohibit you from, for example, pursuing an MLP structure down the road, if that was something you wanted to do with this business?", "Mark A. Snell", "No, that's a great question. I'm glad you brought it up. We specifically designed the JV agreements and the tolling arrangements to allow for an MLP structure if that's the best available capital at any given point in time. And so that's -- it's definitely still in our plans.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And just a very quick small question on the Argentina business. Should be thinking about in terms of any material proceeds or further accounting adjustments there going forward?", "Debra L. Reed", "Joe -- I'm going to have Joe discuss that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, Stephen, the value of the assets, it's been reported in our previous SEC report, it was written down to about $30 million previous to this quarter. So there's no significant proceeds there. But what's important is because of the impairment that we took many years ago, we still have a large tax basis. So we're expecting, as soon as the sale takes place, to file a quick carryback claim and get about $80 million of tax back on this.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And that tax benefit, help me understand how would that -- I sometimes get confused as to how that translates back up to the mothership, as it were?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, we'll get the cash here. It's U.S. tax. It'll come to us and there won't be an earnings effect of it. The earnings effect was booked long ago. But we'll actually get the proceeds from the sale plus this $80 million of cash.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Greg Gordon with the ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered and I think you pretty much answered the 1 remaining in your script, but I just want to be clear. Did you say that if the attrition mechanism was not put in consistent with precedent, that, that was worth about 1% to revenue annually. Is that right?", "Debra L. Reed", "What I said is if you look at the difference between what was granted and our proposed decision, which we would hope to get changed and the utility-specific index, which has been used in virtually all General Rate Cases of recent, that, that is about a 1% difference on an annual basis in the attrition.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And so, I'm with you. It does sound like they ought to be consistent in its application, but if they decided to change that and stick with the proposed decision, it would be sort of 1% less revenue in each of the years of the rate period?", "Debra L. Reed", "That would be the case, but if that were the case, we would obviously have to manage our business to that. And that's what we've made clear is that in -- with the focus that is on the commission right now with their own consultant raising concerns about the order of priority that they place on safety in terms of things, we would find it odd that they would look at doing this type of thing now for our companies when our performance has been so stellar over several years. And so we think that this is something that should be adjusted in the final decision. We've made our case very clear that the basket of bananas and eggs and things like that is not reflective of the cost of utility operation. And so we gave them some pretty specific information on this. There is a lot of support on the record in the case that would justify that this should be changed.", "Operator", "We'll move to a question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "A question on Chile. Now that you've sold down about 20% in Peru and Mexico, on the last call, you said you'd consider selling down some of the interest there. What are your thoughts on that? Has anything changed in your thinking?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I mean we're looking at it. The issue with Chile is that there's an incremental pact that occurs in Chile on -- that we would have to pay for repatriated dollars. And so the benefit of that there and doing the equity issuances there and then looking at that as any kind of repatriation source doesn't -- is not as attractive to us as Peru and Mexico.  The other thing with Chile is that we have a lot of cash there for investments. We have the ability to leverage. We're under leveraged there, and so we're looking at all of that in the context of what we want to do. We like the model of the 80% ownership, but we're only going to do that if it really makes sense and it would do that at a time when it would make sense. We're trying to -- we the transmission projects we're doing in Chile right now. We're bidding on some additional transmission projects there. If we start looking at having all this growth that we hope to see there over the next few years, that would probably be a better time for us to look at doing it.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then second question, now that we're seeing some liquefaction projects, whether yours or others coming online in the Gulf Coast, how is that affecting the value of your storage assets, and maybe some of the actions you're taking with the midstream network, like reversing the Cameron pipeline? Are you taking any incremental action now that we're getting a little bit closer with the midstream assets?", "Debra L. Reed", "Absolutely. And this is something we're very excited about when we look at how the value -- what we think the value of the storage assets will be as all of those LNG facilities start coming on. And you look at where they are, and other than -- all the brownfield, other than Dominion, are located in that whole Gulf area. So let me have Mark talk about some of the things we've been working on.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, I think that it actually is pretty exciting. We are -- we've done our engineering on turning the flow around at Cameron. We're looking at other -- we're looking at other pipeline developments in the region to allow us to more freely move gas around. And our Louisiana storage, which is the closest developable storage to our facility and to the Cheniere and Freeport facilities, that storage will become increasingly more important as these plants start operating.  So we're actually pretty excited about some of the opportunities down there and the ability for us to really become sort of gas managers or being able to help people facilitate the operation of these facilities to make sure that they can run most efficiently, which is continuously all the time and without interruption. And so having readily available gas storage is going to be a real plus. And we're very well positioned to do that.", "Operator", "And now, we'll take a question from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "Just had a question on the solar grant and the delay due to budget sequestration. Is that the kind of thing that you would expect to happen every quarter? Or I guess, that depends on if congress can...", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. No, we would not expect that. We -- the $5 million that we have for this quarter, we would expect that would be it. And then, that there will be a little bit more on depreciation expense down the line, but it's insignificant in future years, very insignificant. So this really takes care of the sequestration issue.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "So if sequestration ends and the company [indiscernible] as usual, would that reverse?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, if we don't -- it's an interesting issue because if sequestration ends and then we haven't gotten the grant, then the grant will not be sequestered. And so it's a funny thing. But so they -- I'll ask Joe to -- or Trevor to talk about the accounting of it. Because right now, we don't know what -- when we get our money back and that will depend on -- what happens will depend on what the timing of the money coming back.", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "Yes, Leslie, when we finished those projects at the of last year, we booked a receivable for the grants that we were going to get, and these are the only grants that we can get the grant programs over, really. So we booked those grants. And then Treasury came out and said, \"These are going to be sequestered and if you get cash back from the government between March and the end of September, you're going to have this cutback.\" So we had to book the cutback. And that's why we took the $5 million earnings. But as Debbie said, if we actually don't get the money until October, we'll get more money. We think we will get it between this time, but who knows. We filed for the grants.", "Mark A. Snell", "I think the important thing is we booked the -- it's onetime deal, we booked a negative effect. I mean, there are some of us sitting around this table wondering how this can be, how you could do this, why this is legal? And -- but at the end of the day, we may end up getting it back someday but right now, the negative effects are all taken care of.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to turn to U.S. business, the utilities, can you just refresh us a little bit? What was the rate base, I guess, the last known or last authorized rate base going all the way back to 2011? What is kind of your recommended rate base for '12 versus kind of where the ALJ proposed decision came in?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I don't -- I have what our actual rate base is, but I don't have the answer to your question for back to 2011. What I can say is what we requested and what the decision granted. And what we requested was about $4.3 billion at SDG&E, and the proposed decision granted $4.1 billion. The key area of difference there is for some smart grid investment, and what the proposed decision did is that it disallowed that in this case, but set another case down the line where you could try to recover it. I think that there are a lot of parties that would like to have us go ahead and move forward with some level of expenditure on smart grids, so it's very possible that something can be reinstated there now.  And then on the SoCalGas gas side, we requested $3.6 billion and received $3.5 billion. Much of the rejection there was in gas operations. And as I already said in my comments, that I think that the focus on gas operation, I would expect us to get reinstatement of a lot of the O&M and the capital because these are basically core business functions.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And if the proposed decision is largely upheld, maybe not entirely but the -- some of the key components of it are upheld, could this put your utilities in a very unusual situation, one they probably haven't faced in 15 or 20 years, which is being -- struggling to actually earn their authorized rate of return?", "Debra L. Reed", "We've managed to -- every kind of outcome we've gotten in rate cases and it -- first of all, I would say, I would not expect this to be the final decision. I do believe that we will see changes made. We've had all-party meeting that I would -- give Commissioner Ferron credit. He had an open process to listen to comments on that. There was an all-party meeting where we discussed our issues. I think the people that were at that all-party meeting felt that we had pretty compelling reasons to see changes in here. So we would expect to see some changes, but we also -- I think we're going to live with what we get, and I don't think that that's a good solution for our customers, nor a good solution for our state, after the clear focus that the CPUC needs to be placing on safety now to look at some of the kinds of reductions that have been here, are really penny-wise and pound-foolish in our mind. And so I think that we will see some changes.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Last question, cash balances at the end of the quarter, large, large number bill 4, bill 5. Can you just talk to me about thoughts around the allocation of that capital?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I'm going to have Joe talk about that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, that really comes from a couple of things, which was we had the proceeds from the IPO coming in right before the end of the quarter, of close to $600 million. And we also did the bond offering in Mexico in February and a lot of that -- a lot of those funds actually repaid intercompany debt back up into one of the Sempra International holding companies. We also received the proceeds from the sale of Mesquite and with that, we mostly paid off commercial paper. But now we have these funds, close to $1 billion of that is from Mexico. And a substantial part of the Mexican IPO funding will be used this year to fund the Sonora pipeline project, and the remainder of those funds used next year together with probably some additional borrowings down there. But that's what this is about. The big increase was mostly things that happened right toward the end of the quarter.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. In other words, a large chunk of that cash, almost $1 billion of that cash, is not sitting at the holding company. It's actually sitting down at the Mexico sub?", "Joseph A. Householder", "That's absolutely right.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I don't  want to like keep going over this, but I just want to make sure I understand it. This attrition mechanism and the compensation issue, you guys mentioned in our press release that you'd be at the bottom end of guidance if this were to -- if the proposed decision wasn't changed. And I guess what I'm wondering is I think of the attrition thing as being more of a -- and I guess compensation, but certainly -- but I think the attrition thing, and particularly of it being more the long-range kind of EPS impact and I'm just wondering if this were to change, I mean, would that -- you said that you'd work within the -- with what you get, but would that not mean that there'd be an impact on long-term growth rate?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I don't tie this to growth rate. First of all, we'll manage with what we get. But the attrition mechanism would affect 2013 because, as you know, it's taken us 1.5 years to get a rate case decision. So we are basically operating on 2011 revenue requirement. We didn't get an increase in 2012, and then we should have gotten attrition increase to the 2012 level for 2013. So we're basically 2 years behind in terms of having revenues to operate our company. That -- we don't think that what is in the proposed decision is what should be voted out by the commission. We made the case on that. We made a very strong case on this attrition because it's not consistent with prior regulatory decisions. They have just voted out 4 months ago the Edison decision and gave them what is an appropriate utility index attrition mechanism. And so we do expect to get it changed. If it is not changed, then the mechanism here has historically been about 1% a year less in attrition increase than what the utility specific. But if that's what we get, we'll have to find a way to manage through it. But it's not to the benefit of our customers to have that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I know you guys aren't going to give guidance until we get until we get the final decision, but should we be thinking about any potential change in long-term growth rate?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. No, I mean, I think I -- at least I tried to articulate that the long-term growth rate would be consistent with what we had showed you before in February, but that what we will do is that if we get a decision, we will give you more definitive information on that and the numbers for 2013 and narrow the range, as we talked to you that we would do, and then give you more detail on that growth rate.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Paul, this is Joe. When I showed you guys that chart, I mean, it's been our stated objective to be at 6% to 8%, but as I said, we're working on a lot of new areas of development, new projects, which is going to drive it above that. So our expectation right now is that these growth rates will be the same. And we'll talk more about it when we get to the conference, assuming we get the PD -- or finalized.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "That's excellent. I think that's great. And I guess what I wanted to just finally touch base with you on is, there was this IRS ruling that came out, or letter, what have you, on April 15 regarding the construction date for like ITC, PTC. And I was wondering you guys have probably had a chance to look of this, and what have you. Do you think that, that provides some additional opportunity for some renewable stuff for you guys? Or, I mean, is that sort of -- just any thoughts you guys have on what they came up with, the sort of the language that they use in terms of the construction date and stuff?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we think it's constructive and we are pursuing some additional opportunities to see if we can get under construction by next year as required under those guidelines. So we're moving forward to seek some additional opportunities in the wind space.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from Maura Shaughnessy with MFS Investment Management.", "Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I -- 2 quick ones. First, have you actually announced the sale of Argentina? Or are you just hoping that it's done by the end of the year? And the second point on the attrition issue and the compensation issue, were these kind of totally out of the blue? I can't recall these mechanisms ever coming up in California before, with the CPI linkage and sort of random employee compensation? Well, I don't why I would say that, but anyway, yes, those 2 questions, please?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I'll have Mark hit the Argentina sale and where we are on that.", "Mark A. Snell", "Hi. With respect to Argentina, no, we do expect to close by year-end. We're in active negotiations to sell our interest and we have been for some time and we're working out the details. But it's -- we're not -- it's not like we're just starting the marketing now.", "Debra L. Reed", "And then in terms of your other question on the mechanism, let me just say that have a brand-new commissioner. This is his first rate case that he's dealing with. And that the -- you haven't heard about attrition mechanisms or compensation generally because usually in every rate case, the utility-specific attrition mechanism's been adopted and the incentive comp, if it's found is be at market by the commission's own compensation study, is put in rate. I mean, that is really the requirement to allow the utility to recover reasonable costs. And if your compensation is reasonable, you should be able to get that. And if the attrition is based upon utility-specific industry, you should be able to get that. This is our -- a new commissioner with a first rate case decision that he is writing, and I give him credit. He's listening to some of the other commissioners. He had an all-party meeting where parties could make their thoughts known and I'm hoping that what we will see is changes in this based upon him listening to some of the experienced commissioners that have dealt with this issue historically.", "Operator", "We'll move to a question from Santiago Perez Teuffer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Santiago Perez Perez Teuffer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wondered coming from you, there is a lot of expectation on how is the Mexican energy industry shaping out. I mean, your IPO is a clear example of the expectations the market has and the value that's rising on it. I wanted to ask if you could please share your expectations in Mexico going forward and any kind expectations you have in new bidding processes?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm going to turn it to Mark.", "Mark A. Snell", "Santiago, we had a little bit of trouble hearing you, but we think, if your question was what is our expectations in Mexico and the growth going forward. Is that your question?", "Santiago Perez Perez Teuffer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, exactly. I mean, do you have any kind expectations on new bidding processes?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, good. Look, we're really excited about what -- our opportunities in Mexico. The ones, the projects that we mentioned on the roadshow and the pipeline projects and also the wind project that we have, ESJ, both of those are slated to go here in the near term. Long-term prospects, obviously, the Mexican infrastructure needs and Mexico's desire to wean itself, at least for electrical production off of oil and on to natural gas, is going to allow for a lot of infrastructure development projects in central Mexico and throughout those regions. And so we're pretty excited about it. We've got the right vehicle in place to assist Mexico in making those infrastructure developments. And that's why we're so excited about this company and why we think its growth prospects are so good.", "Santiago Perez Perez Teuffer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Do you have any time frames like when will new bids come up in your perspective? I mean, about probably the second phase of Los Ramones or any other project do you believe it's interesting?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, we don't have any specific timing, but we -- recognizing that some of these -- the ultimate plants and things and chemical treatment facilities that are going to use the natural gas is being transported or their products that were being transported back to market. Obviously, as those the other phases of these projects all have to come in fairly swift order, otherwise they're kind of pipelines to nowhere. And all of that's happening and so I think -- I don't think any of this is super long term. I mean we're, probably in the next 5 years, we're going to see a lot of development in Mexico.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "I wanted to understand something that Paul Patterson, I think, asked about the growth rate there that I want to get a better understanding. So the guidance for 2013 changed a little based on some items. Does that mean we should be taking the same growth rate off of a new number? Or should we be adjusting the growth rate per future numbers, whatever we were extrapolating earlier?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I'm not going to say how to do the calculation but I will tell you is that what we've said with our growth rate, was what Joe showed in February. If you take the 2013 earnings and then you subtract from that the retroactive piece of the rate case, and then from that is where you would grow. And that we were looking at a 6% to 8% growth rate and we're looking at that same range.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC", "So it doesn't change even though -- so even though the base number may have changed, the growth thing doesn't?", "Debra L. Reed", "The growth rate is still the same, yes.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Vanessa Quiroga with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Vanessa Quiroga - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "It's actually regarding IEnova again and in the specifics about your leverage in that entity. Right now it's very low but we would assumed that with more growth, new projects, you would be willing to increase your leverage. But what is the maximum level that you would be comfortable with at the IEnova level?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm going -- I would just say that this is exactly why we did this is, in response to your question, is so that we can lever up and that we can grow that business because we think it's a terrific business. And so I'll have Joe talk about how much leverage we could put on that business.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, on the roadshow, what we talked about was the fact that we would issue some more debt likely next year as we use the IPO proceeds for the construction of the Sonora pipelines. And that when we got the AAA credit rating there, we talked to the rating agencies and they said they'd be comfortable with that credit rating as long we stayed below 3x debt to EBITDA. And what I spoke about was at the Sempra level, we have roughly a 50-50 debt-equity ratio and I need to manage that across the whole portfolio. So as we start to reach those levels, then we'll have to consider where we are. But no more than 3x debt to EBITDA or 50-50. But as they continue to grow their EBITDA, there's going to be a lot of capacity there.", "Vanessa Quiroga - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, yes. I agree. I mean, this 3x debt to EBITDA, when you talk about the EBITDA, you don't mean pro forma for -- or assuming when the new projects start generating EBITDA already, right? You would be talking about the current year debt to EBITDA?", "Joseph A. Householder", "I think if you focused sort of the 50-50 debt-to-equity ratio and the -- hold on one second. I think at that rate, and we're probably looking at the current run rate of EBITDA. But as I said, it's growing fast because these projects are coming on quickly.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Ashar Khan with Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Debbie, if -- I don't want to go like too deep in it. So how should we follow the proceeding next week if they do adhere to the schedule and -- on the rate case and they do come out with a decision? Will they discuss this in their meeting? Or will we have to wait for a final order to find out whether they made the changes to what we like or didn't make the changes? Can you just tell us how we can monitor it on our end?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, the typical way this would go is that changes would be published before the meeting. And then the commission would vote on the decision with those changes at the meeting. So it's on the agenda for next week. What would typically happen is those changes would come out later this week or early next week. And then all of the commission officers would have the opportunity to review those changes and then the commissioners would then vote on it. If the commissioner had a concern about what was in there after those changes were made, the commissioner could hold it at that meeting and could make an election to write an alternate decision or go back the assigned commissioner to suggest further changes. So that's kind of how the process unfolds.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay, so that would show up. So that any changes would show up in the docket of the case, right? That's where I should be looking at?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, that's what should happen. And then, of course, we will provide as much information as we can once we get the final decisions out. It does take a while to analyze these decisions, and one of the reasons that we want to be sure when we give you new guidance is that we have the full time to analyze the decisions. Because just looking at the revenue requirement does not necessarily yield what the outcome is going to be. So it will take us a little while to analyze.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. And the second question is, I don't it's a new company and all that and I know -- I apologize, there were too many earnings today. Is IEnova going to have an earnings call? Or can you give us any sense of what their earnings were exactly year-over-year?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, we're not going to do subsegment information in our call that -- the plan is in the future, IEnova will have its own earnings call, and we'll provide that information to its investors. And I don't know, Mark or Joe, do you want to add anything to that?", "Mark A. Snell", "I think that's right. We'll -- they're going to do their own. We will only comment on them to the extent that it affects Sempra and we'll give you that data on our call.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. I'll just add, the one thing to remember is in Mexico, they're reported under IFRS so the numbers are going to be slightly different. And we don't give, as Debbie said, we don't give subsegment information. So we give you guidance at the Sempra International level, but I think you all could listen in to their calls and, I think, starting next quarter probably is when they'll get set up to start doing it.", "Debra L. Reed", "And I just was reminded that their release is on our website, too. So you can go to our website and can see their release. But I do believe next quarter, they're going to start the call.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay, so they do have their own release, which is on your website?", "Mark A. Snell", "Right.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll now hear from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "One just follow-up question. I'm sure you heard the commentary from Edison the other day on San Onofre. Could you just -- any color to add there? And just in the event that the plant does need to be shut down, what are your recourse actions to take?", "Debra L. Reed", "The thing I would say is that, that I read the Edison transcript and what they say about kind of their decision point. We are not -- we're a minority owner. We own 20% of the plant. We've never operated the plant. We didn't decide on what kind of steam generators went in. We didn't do any of that. And so we have to kind of look at our own position in this case, and that we are waiting for the NRC to act and we're going to see what they do. And that we're hopeful that we will get something out by early summer from the NRC. And then we're going to make our decisions on our options based upon what's best for our customers. And that's what we'll be looking at. And we may not be on the same time line as Edison is precisely. But we will look at our options as what's best for our customers as a minority owner of that plant. And I can't really add anything. Edison went through, on their call, of the details about the 2 applications, the license amendment and the confirmatory action letter, and they're better to handle those kinds of questions because they're the ones that are dealing with the agencies and operating the facility.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.", "Vedula Murti", "A couple of things. One, in your earlier remarks in answer to questions when the question of incremental renewable came up, I think you indicated you were focusing -- you'd be focusing in wind arena. And I think that was all based on production tax credit. What's -- do you have a point of view as to, one, some prospects for the renewable and multi-legislation that's pending? And based on your analysis, I'm wondering whether, if that were to occur, whether that's basically something for things prospectively or given stimulation [ph] of tax credits having been utilized in whatever in the past that historic existing assets would be unlikely to fit into such structure. And I have a separate question after that.", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. Well, let me just say that the focus of my answer on wind was specific to that extension in the legislation, but we are developing solar projects. And we have a 250-megawatt project that's going into construction. We have a project that we're working on to be in the queue on the solar side. So I don't want to give any impression that our focus is just on wind, because we are very actively pursuing other projects. But we love your question about the MLP. And actually when I have my meeting with the President earlier this year, that was one of the things we talked about would be very beneficial to the industry is to have some type of a REIT or MLP structure for renewables. But Mark was just involved in this about a week ago. So let me turn it to Mark.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, look, I think we are kind of excited about the prospect for renewables to be put in the MLPs and be given parity with other energy projects in the country. So we think it's a good development. I will tell you it's one of the very few things that has -- seems to have relatively broad bipartisan support. I think the thing that's holding it up from being approved is that it's a -- well, it has sort of bipartisan support. It's not really big deal to the people on the hill. And so at the end, it will probably be attached to some other larger tax bill or something that goes through.  There is -- we have questions about how it's going to work for existing projects and I don't think that's been fully fleshed out. There has to be some other -- besides just making MLP-able because the MLPs have these tax credits, how that will do or if that will be a replacement for the tax credit. Nobody really knows how those things will come to be, but we do think it's exciting. We think it's something that makes a lot of sense, and we'd be well-positioned to put some of our assets and add it to our midstream MLP or create a separate one on its own, whichever kind of investors sort of look to want to do. So we think both of those things they are -- we thing they're exciting and it is something that does look like it has good support right now.", "Vedula Murti", "Okay. And secondarily, Debbie, you mentioned your meeting with the President. I was going to ask you, based on all your commentary around your positive view from the news, head of DOE and terms of nat gas exports and all the various export facilities, did that come up in your conversation? And do you feel like that that's the view -- that view there is similar as to the view at DOE?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I mean, I was asked specifically not to share what occurred in the meetings. But I would say that the attendees of the meeting, universally, were quite favorable to the ability to export gas if there were appropriate provisions put in place to deal with all -- environmental issues associated with the frac-ing. And so, I think that's the direction it's heading. I didn't sense anything at all that would run counter to that direction in the discussions I had.", "Vedula Murti", "Yes. The one last thing, in terms of the approve [ph] status of free trade versus non-free-trade export, my recollection was that earlier this year, there was talk about trying to perhaps give an exemption or something like that to Japan and maybe western Europe since they're kind of allies or whatever. Is there anything going on, on that side at all?", "Debra L. Reed", "It seems like that has kind of died down a bit. And I think where the focus is now, I mean, we really do hear a number of things that at least -- and you never get definitive answers of when something is going to be approved. But we have heard a number of comments that would lead us to believe that the approvals are forthcoming and the approvals are forthcoming sometime in the near future. And that is not going to be that type of a structure with limited approval. So and you start hearing more, too, I think with the situation in North Korea, that you start hearing more, the concerns about what do we do to help support, generally, our allies? What do we do to have the U.S. be a contributor into the energy marketplace that would help deal with some of these political issues. And so it seems the -- at least the dialogue has gone more in that direction recently, which would say you're probably not going to just get a Japanese exemption or a Europe exemption.", "Operator", "I was just going to turn it back over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. I was going just take it. So, thank you, all, very much for joining us. As always, we have Rick and Victor and Diane there to answer any of your follow-up questions from the call.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 27, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to Slide 3 and I let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 2013 was another great year for our company, and one filled with many accomplishments on our infrastructure projects, partnership initiatives and regulatory effort. We are extremely happy that our Cameron Liquefaction project received the Department of Energy's conditional permit to export to non-Free-Trade-Agreement countries on February 11. And with a noteworthy progress, we are making and securing our FERC permit. We expect construction on this project to begin this year. We will provide further details later on the call.", "Turning to our financial results. I continue to be pleased with our performance of sustained delivery of top tier shareholder return. With the DOE non-FTA permit for Cameron now in hand, we have given greater confidence in the earnings contribution Cameron will provide starting in 2018. This puts us well on our way to meeting our goal of 9% to 11% compound annual earnings growth through 2019. Additionally, I'm confident that we will execute on some of the growth opportunities we've identified which are not yet in our plan. This would allow us to get to the higher end of that range, and I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our analyst conference next month.", "Now let me hand things over to Joe to discuss the 2013 results in more detail, starting with Slide 4. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie, and good afternoon or good morning to everybody. Our results for the fourth quarter exceeded the expectations we've provided on our third quarter call and resulted in a strong finish to 2013. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $282 million or $1.13 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings of $268 million or $1.08 per share in the same quarter last year. Including both the impact of the $77 million 2012 retroactive benefit from our General Rate Case in California and the $119 million loss on the closure of SONGS, we reported 2013 GAAP earnings of $1,001,000,000 or $4.01 per share. For guidance purposes, we reported 2013 earnings per share of $4.49, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $4.30 to $4.60 per share. These earnings per share exclude the loss on SONGS, but they include the retroactive GRC benefits.", "Full year 2013 adjusted earnings, which exclude both the SONGS loss and the retroactive GRC benefit totaled $1,043,000,000 or $4.18 per share. There were 2 major factors to 2013 adjusted earnings that arose from our previously announced repatriation strategy and the IEnova IPO. Both of these strategic decisions were designed to create and have in fact, increased total shareholder value.", "Just to recap those in more detail. 2013 was the first year of our plan to repatriate cash from international operations back to the United States. While we pay little in cash taxes on this repatriation, we do have to book an income tax expense when we bring the funds back to the U.S. For 2013, this tax expense was $63 million or $0.25 per share. The cash flow to the U.S. from this plan supports our strategy to continue growing our dividend.", "Second, in March, we completed the IPO of IEnova in Mexico which has been tremendously successful, creating significant value for Sempra shareholders. Since the IPO, IEnova's stock is up over 70% and the value of Sampra's investment has increased by more than $1.5 billion. This increased value has more than compensated our shareholders for the $26 million or $0.10 per share dilution we reported in 2013. In addition to those factors, as discussed on our third quarter call, the Mexican government enacted tax reform that keeps the Mexican corporate tax rate at 30% after 2013, as opposed to a scheduled reduction to 28% under prior law. This change will have only a minimal impact to ongoing earnings, but did negatively affect 2013 results by $13 million due to the required adjustment to our deferred tax liabilities.", "When taking these items into consideration, I can see that the health of our underlying business remains strong and in line with our long-term growth aspirations.", "Now let's go through the segment results in more detail, beginning with SDG&E on Slide 5. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $119 million compared to earnings of $110 million in the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter earnings were higher primarily due to $28 million of higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, partially offset by a $10 million impact of lower authorized CPUC and FERC returns, and $4 million of lost SONGS earnings due to the plant closure. For the year, SDG&E reported adjusted earnings of $471 million as compared to $484 million in 2012. Earnings in 2012 included a $22 million higher income tax benefit resulting from the change in the treatment of repair expenditures that relates to the year 2011. In 2013, we also partially offset impacts from the lower authorized rates of return and loss of SONGS earnings with higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, as SDG&E identified operating efficiencies to improve their performance.", "Now please turn to Slide 6. Fourth quarter 2013 earnings at Southern California Gas were consistent with the last year at $98 million. This quarter's results were impacted by $30 million of lower tax benefits as earnings for the fourth quarter of last year included the full year's impact of the change in tax treatment for repair expenditures. This tax impact was offset in the fourth quarter of 2013 by $19 million of higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, and $12 million of reduced tax expense related to prior year's income tax issues.", "SoCalGas increased annual adjusted earnings by $50 million to $339 million in 2013. This increase largely reflects $36 million of higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, in part due to operating efficiencies that SoCalGas identified to improve performance. Higher 2013 earnings also includes $15 million in pipeline integrity expenses that are now being fully recovered in rates.", "Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 7. At our South American Utilities, fourth quarter 2013 earnings were $43 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Full year 2013 earnings were $153 million. Excluding the $11 million loss on the sale of our Argentine investments, this segment was in line with our expectations.", "Fourth quarter 2013 earnings for Sempra Mexico segment were $26 million versus earnings of $35 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter earnings reflect a $13 million increase in deferred income tax expense due to the change in tax law I discussed earlier and an $8 million decrease resulting from our noncontrolling interest at IEnova. These effects were partially offset by $9 million of higher net earnings as a result of recording AFUDC earnings for pipeline construction. For the full year 2013, Sempra Mexico's earnings were $122 million compared with $157 million in 2012. Similar to the quarter, the decrease in earnings resulted from the end of year change in Mexican tax law and a $26 million dilutive effect from the IEnova IPO.", "Now please turn to Slide 8. Moving to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $6 million in the year-ago period after excluding the $25 million payment received from Kinder Morgan for tax impacts related to the sale of their interest in REX. Higher fourth quarter earnings were due primarily to a lower of cost or market adjustment that occurred in 2012 related to the purchase of an LNG cargo in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the change in intercompany marketing agreements that reduced cost in 2013. For the full year, Sempra Natural Gas reported 2013 earnings of $64 million. Included in this amount is a $44 million gain on the sale of one block at the Mesquite Power Plant.", "Fourth quarter 2013 earnings for the renewable segment was $6 million compared with earnings of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Higher earnings in 2012 reflect $12 million of higher deferred income tax benefits as a result of assets placed into service in 2012. For 2013, annual earnings of $62 million include $24 million of gains associated with our new solar joint ventures.", "Let's please turn to Slide 9. Turning now to our guidance for 2014. We are reaffirming expected consolidated earnings for the year to fall within the range of $4.25 to $4.55 per share. Overall, our near-term and long-term prospects remain very strong and we are looking forward to giving you more detail on our outlook at next month's analyst conference. In addition, the Board voted in February to increase our annualized dividend by approximately 5% to $2.64 per share. We recognize that returning capital to shareholders is important and we remain committed to providing a strong and growing dividend to the owners of Sempra. Once Cameron is in construction, we intend to recommend a higher dividend growth as an alternative to a larger one-time increase after Cameron is operational.", "Now let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss Slide 10.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. As I mentioned at the outset of this call, we were pleased to receive our permit to export to non-FTA countries from the Department of Energy on February 11. We are also the first on the list of proposed LNG projects to have received our Draft Environmental Impact Statement from FERC. FERC schedule calls for issuance of the final EIS on or before April 30, 2014. This is the last major step in securing our FERC order authorizing the construction and operation of the project. And we expect to receive that order this summer.", "In addition to progress on permitting, we are finalizing terms on the lump sum construction contract with our preferred EPC contractor. The cost estimates for the project remains in line with the $6 billion to $7 billion of construction cost, and $9 billion to $10 billion of total cost that we have consistently projected. We have also made substantial progress in securing financing. We are working with the Japanese export credit agencies to finalize their loan commitment. And earlier this month, we signed a commitment letter with commercial banks worldwide as part of our very successful commercial bank syndication. Given this development, we continue to have confidence we will be able to close long tenure borrowing at very attractive rates.", "Subject to FERC's final approval, the project remains on track to start construction in 2014, and we still expect all 3 trains to come online throughout 2018, with the first full year of 3-train production in 2019.", "Concerning the progress of our Cameron LNG facility, we want to take this opportunity to update you on our thinking around the potential MLP strategy. We have a great asset in Cameron. And we know that it could serve as a very strong and anchor for an MLP, as it will provide natural drop-down given its significant cash flow underpinned by 20-year contract. Since those cash flows don't start for several years, we continue to explore ways to jumpstart an MLP using our own storage of pipeline assets or by developing or buying other assets. After much analysis, we've determined that, currently, our existing assets don't provide the certainty of cash flows to support the formation of an MLP that will generate the premium valuation our shareholders deserve.", "We will continue to assess this. In fact, the assets, like rocks [ph], are well positioned to secure contracts for transport of that out of the Marcellus and Utica, and could help jumpstart an MLP. As you saw with our IEnova IPO, we are focused on structures that increase value for Sempra shareholders both today and into the future, and we will time a possible MLP accordingly.", "Using Cameron as a strong foundation for future MLP is bolstered by the many exciting prospects we have to grow in and around the LNG and gas infrastructure businesses. Mark will provide you with more information on these emerging opportunities at next month's analyst conference. At that time, Joe will also go into more detail about our MLP thought process.", "Let's now turn to Slide 11 for an update on regulatory proceedings for our California utility. In January 2014, SDG&E filed an uncontested multiparty settlement agreement with FERC on our Electric Transmission formula that establish an authorized return on equity of 10.05%. The FERC order approving the settlement should be issued by the end of the third quarter in 2014. But will be retroactive to September of last year, and this settlement will be in effect through December 2018. The settlement specifically allows SDG&E the right to apply for incentive adders on future projects and determines the equity ratio based upon actual equity recorded on December 31 of each year. Terms of the settlement are reflected in our fourth quarter 2013 earnings and in our 2014 guidance.", "Second, on SONGS. The CPUC's proceedings remain ongoing and while the commission is encouraging parties to engage in settlement discussions, we expect the final resolution of all proceedings to take some time. We continue to believe that the amount of our remaining regulatory asset is reasonable and will be recovered.", "Now please turn to Slide 12. In Peru, our Santa Teresa Hydro project remains on schedule and should be completed later this year. The 100-megawatt project is our first generation project in Peru, and I'm confident it will be the first of many additional projects we will execute there. In fact, Mark, Joe and I recently visited South America and are enthusiastic about prospects for growth in Chile and Peru. We will discuss more specifics at the conference next month, but there are a number of possible projects in South America that fits very well with our strategy, including gas pipelines and electric generation and transmission opportunity.", "In Mexico, we also continue to move ahead on our many infrastructure projects. Construction of the first phase of our Sonora Pipeline project is on schedule and on budget, and this 300-mile segment is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. The second segment of the pipeline is projected to start operations in the second half of 2016.", "In January, construction began on the Los Ramones I project as part of our joint venture with PEMEX. And that pipeline is also expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. We continue to work on finalizing the contract for our participation in the Northern Phase of Los Ramones II and I anticipate these negotiations will conclude very soon. As you'll recall, we expect to have a 25% share of this segment of the pipeline.", "Finally, in Mexico. Last quarter, we've started construction on the 156-megawatt ESJ Wind project, which is supported by a 20-year contract with SDG&E. As we discussed last quarter, formation of a 50-50 joint venture for this project was delayed due to our original prospective partner's decision to exit the wind development business. However, negotiations are progressing well with other interested parties and I'm confident we will finalize the JV very soon.", "Finally, in the first quarter of 2014, we made the decision to hold for sale the second block of the Mesquite Power Plant in Arizona. It continues to be our goal to complete our exit of the merchant generation business, and we are making good progress on the sale of this asset. However, since we do not yet have a contract for sale, we are not including the transaction in the guidance that we reaffirmed today.", "Now let's finish by turning to Slide 13. In summary, 2013 was another very good year for our company. Demonstrating how well our business strategy performs in our changing market and regulatory condition. We have already made significant progress on planned infrastructure projects, and with over $2 billion of projects scheduled to come online before next year, I'm equally optimistic about future earnings. Sempra's diversified portfolio and focused strategy on long-term contracted cash flow positions us well for growth in the years ahead.", "And with that, let me stop and take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Greg Gordon of ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can we take the commentary around the time horizon for the sort of ability for you guys to flow the -- an MLP, part and parcel with your willingness to be more aggressive on the dividend in the intermediate term, and sort of the financial sort of balancing act you're making in order to try to drive the best shareholder value for your investors until the point where you get to a viable portfolio of MLP-eligible assets?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, as I said -- I mean, I think, just the Cameron asset alone, has great potential for an MLP with the ability to drop down that in pieces over time and have clear visibility to that. And I thought, as the debt is paid off, the earnings increase and that there's some good upside from that asset. Right now, as we look at the other assets we have, we don't feel that it would be in our shareholder's interest to do a bridge strategy without those assets. But I will say, we're constantly looking at other assets that we could potentially acquire. And if we found some good assets that would create a good bridge strategy, we're not opposed to do that. On the dividend issue, we have a great deal of confidence now about Cameron coming online. After getting the non-FTA permit and being where we are in the FERC process, we're feeling very confident about this project going online with all 3 trains coming on in 2018. And then full 3-year operations -- 3-train operations in 2019. And so, as we look at our dividend, we've had a policy of 45% to 50% payout ratio. We see the earnings coming in 2018 and 2019, and we really think that we can do that dividend and it not be inconsistent with any MLP strategy. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. Greg, I'm just making another point. I don't see them as a very linked at all. I think that we have really strong earnings and growth in our other businesses besides just Cameron. And so this dividend is in response to our continually growing earnings from that. And as we look forward and study the MLP, we'll have enough cash flow from LP and GP units to keep our dividend even post an MLP. So I don't see that as any kind of a bridge, it's from the strong earnings that we have.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "A follow-up question. Have you considered -- given so successful in the IEnova transaction, have you considered as a -- instead of an IPO of your MLP-eligible assets, doing a strategic transaction with another entity with an existing GP, where you contributed your assets for a GP stake and, thus, helped to drive further growth for that other entity and, therefore, added value to the GP shares that you would be acquiring?", "Debra L. Reed", "I would say, we look at all of those things, Greg. That -- the thing that we have got to be sure is that, with the Cameron asset, we want to be sure that our shareholders get the right kinds of splits, have the right kind of long-term structure for our assets that we're going to put in. And if we found something that would work with that, we would definitely be open to considering that. But we're not going to rush to get something out that devalues our assets in the long-term.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I just had a follow-up on the MLP question. So you're not willing to use a bridge strategy with REX right now, but with where mid-stream assets are going for in terms of valuation, how do you expect to compete without having an MLP in place to buy some of these assets?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, what I said was that if we look at our existing assets right now, putting them in MLP to do a bridge strategy, we don't think that was the best thing. What I also said, though, is that, some things are changing with those -- the value of those assets that we might see in the future. And as you know that after we basically have REX flow, bidirectionally, are moving forward and that, that could offer some opportunities if we can have contracts that extend beyond the expiration of the existing contracts. So -- and we just did a nonbinding open season and that had some -- it gave us some promise that there's some real upside with that asset, potentially. So we will continue to look at that. And if we had to make an acquisition for a bridge strategy that made economic sense in the long term, we would look at doing what made economic sense in the long term.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And secondly, on the 9% to 11% growth rate. Kind of bridge that with the previous 6% to 8% growth rate before -- I guess, you guys included Cameron for 2018 and 2019. So does the 9% to 11% include projects that are not in the development plan or not in the earnings plan right now? Do that exceed 11% or is it kind of -- you'd be the closer to 9% without those projects and towards the higher end of the range if you executed on some of the growth projects?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We'll go through this in detail at the analyst meeting. But when we look at that range of 9% to 11%, the 9% basically includes what we have in our base plan without incremental growth and Cameron at full operation in 2019. We will go through the upsides that we have in our -- that are not in our plan but are upsides to that plan at the analyst meeting. But there are a lot of things happening in that regard and a number of bids are coming out in 2014 even that could add to that and get us towards the high end of that range. And that's what I commented on, as if we pick up some of those projects, we could definitely be towards the high end of that range by 2019.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Apologies, I just want to beat up once more on the MLP topic. Assuming you don't make any major acquisitions and your existing assets don't change in such a way that you'll be even [ph] more MLP-able between now and when Cameron does start operating, should we assume that it is your plan to form an MLP with Cameron as the anchor in 2018 or 2019? Or are you still not sure that you'd go that route when you get to that point?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I mean, these are discussions that obviously we will have our Board of Directors as we get closer. But if everything stays as it does today and if there's opportunities to grow at that midstream business with cheaper equity and do that, then that would be our intent. But that's a while off, so things could change, tax laws could change, interest rates could change. But as we look at it today, that's the direction we would be headed.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And just to clarify on your comments around the dividend growth, you're planning to propose accelerated dividend growth starting, I guess, next year, assuming that Cameron enters construction as opposed to staying on the same trajectory you've been on recently and waiting all the way until 2018 for more of a step change. Is that correct?", "Debra L. Reed", "That's generally correct. Let me just have Joe talk about kind of how we're thinking about the dividend.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. As we said, we right now today have a dividend payout ratio that is higher than the 45% to 50% that we've set with the board long term because of the repatriation plan. And we just recommended and they approved an increase of almost 5% now for this year. And what we said is once Cameron is in construction later this year, then we go to next year's dividend, we think we will suggest a slightly faster pace that will allow us to get to the 45% to 50% in 2019. So you can kind of assume that we'll be suggesting something more of a straight line from 2015 to 2019 that you gets to that 45%, 50%.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just on the Cameron financing, is that pretty much just waiting for FERC approval before that gets secured? Or are there other issues that you're still working through?", "Debra L. Reed", "Mark, why don't you talk a little bit about where we stand on Cameron, in general, including the financing?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I think, in general, we're in very good shape. And I would point out that just to comment on, in line with the dividend question, just to remind you all that this whole project, we're committing existing assets and we fully expect to finance and use the contributions from our partners to finance construction. So that's not a drain on our cash, so we certainly are able to raise the dividend without -- that there's no concerns there. As far as financing goes, and Joe can comment on this as well, but we have a very, very robust response to our financing efforts. And we are highly confident of being able to completely finance this project without any problems.", "Debra L. Reed", "Another comment on where we are with the EPC, too.", "Mark A. Snell", "We're in the final kind of final weeks of negotiating the EPC contract. And what I will say is that we will have -- we will come out of with this with a contract that is a lump sum turnkey project contract that shifts the construction risk to the EPC contractor. And I think there was always some concern whether that would happen, but the market has been good around that and we have a very nice contract that we're very happy with, with a very experienced builder.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask about the underlying assets within the U.S. Natural Gas business. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with gas storage economics, given the volatility we've just seen over the last couple of months and whether a change in the economics have started to appear in gas storage or whether the gas storage market appears somewhat depressed still?", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure, Michael. Let me just start generally, and then I'm going to turn it over to Mark to add a few more detail. We did talk about REX and what we see happening there. And many of you have written about what's happening in Marcellus and Utica. And you've talked about a lot of the pipelines reversing flow going into the Gulf area. And what we see in the Gulf area is we see colder gas conversion and in the Southeast in that region. And we also see all the LNG export occurring. And that -- we think that is going to change some of the dynamics relative to storage certainly. And what we're starting to see is an interest in contracting on longer-term basis for some of the storage assets because I think others are seeing the same thing and think that it will be good to get some long-term contracts. Mark, do you want to add a little bit to that?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes. A couple of things I would just say is that -- and I know you can appreciate the technical nature of some of my comments here. But what we've seen in the past is we've had a very depressed storage market with really the only value being recognized is the summer, winter spread that frankly has been relatively small and weak over the last few years. We're certainly seeing that change now, we're seeing a higher value for that. But then I think even more importantly for the first time in probably 4 years or so, we're seeing a real return to some extrinsic value. So valuing that volatility around the gas market, we're seeing a value put on that, and we're getting that in our storage rates currently. So I think that part of the business seems to be coming back a bit. And in fact, I think for the first time we've actually sold some storage to marketers, which we haven't done in a long time. So there is something going on there. I'm a little bit reluctant to say that it's back to where it was 7 or 8 years ago. But it's certainly a better market today than it was 6 months ago.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And when thinking about REX and kind of the reversal of REX back to or at least a part of REX back to Midwest, how long do you and your partners think you could -- how long do you think it likely will take before you sign up a lot greater percentage or a greater portion of REX to move gas from either the Marcellus or Utica into the Midwest?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we would hope to do that very soon. That, as I said, we had a nonbinding open season. And there seemed to be a lot of interest in that, and so we would like to pursue that. And then you've also seen all the announcements through the pipeline, some of which actually connected to REX, the reverse flows going from north to south. And so we think this is going to happen relatively soon with the need for takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus and the Utica. We also are working on the lateral that we talked to you about previously, and that will be in service very shortly in 2014, probably by April. So the whole dynamics of that are changing that area is going to change rapidly and we need to be able to respond rapidly, and we will.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I have 2 questions. One, can you just talk about what you're seeing as it relates to the market for buying existing midstream assets as it relates to pricing, things like that? And second question, specifically on Cameron, with more clarity on financing costs, et cetera, do you still feel good about the numbers you laid out before in terms of the EPS contribution, et cetera?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Let me start with the last question on Cameron. And yes, we feel very good about the numbers that we've talked about at Cameron. With everything we've seen with the EPC contract, the financing and all, as I reaffirmed today, those numbers look good. I'll talk a little bit about at a high level, the midstream. And I don't want to go into details on assets. But what I think you're starting to see now is a cycle that's kind of been interesting and it's repeated itself multiple times in the E&P business, where you're starting to see more of the E&P companies look at selling off some of their midstream assets so that they can invest that stream. So I think what we saw a few years ago is starting to change a little bit. And so we will continue to look at opportunities as these changes occur. Chevron has looked at some asset sales. Chesapeake is looking at some asset sales. And it's very typical when E&P companies decide that they need to invest more upstream for them to look at the selling off some of those assets, and so we'll be exploring that. And in terms of asset pricing. Obviously, you're competing with MLPs and that are interested in getting those assets. And so we will continue to look at every opportunity that is out there and whether it fits for us. The good thing is that we have some opportunities in the LNG space that Mark will talk about more at the conference. But I'll let him just maybe give a little bit on that right now.", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I would say that if you think of LNG as being sort of a midstream asset that's certainly MLP-able, we are starting to see opportunities in the LNG space. And I'm going into some detail on some specifics at the conference. But I think we are kind of starting construction on Cameron with a mindset that this isn't just a single-asset business. It is a business that we believe we can grow, and we can continue to add to it. And we're very excited about the opportunity to really have an LNG business and not just an LNG asset. So I think that's what's very exciting. And I will say on the other midstream stuff, it's a very competitive market. And the stuff that we've seen that's been priced reasonably is stuff that we typically don't want. And the stuff that we've looked at that we want is either not for sale or very, very expensive. And so we certainly are taking that into consideration. And I think most of you have enough confidence in us that this is a management team that's pretty thoughtful about how we make investments in these kinds of things. And we're looking to do -- we are certainly anxious to do something that builds shareholder value. But we're also very willing to be patient.", "Joseph A. Householder", "I'd just add to that one thing, too, is we're a very strong company with a very strong balance sheet. And where the 10-year debt is, is very low. And our after-tax cost of capital for borrowing money to buy something is pretty low. But as Mark said, we're going to be very disciplined about looking at things and make sure they were the right thing to do.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And just a quick follow-up. So you talked about the asset side. What about actually buying an existing company or sort of that idea?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll ask Mark to add because I've already given some kind of my view. So I'll ask Mark to add...", "Mark A. Snell", "When you say buying an existing company, you mean as far as -- in which state.", "Debra L. Reed", "With a general partner or...", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes. Or rather than buying -- doing a piecemeal and buying assets to put into an MLP, maybe buy an actual company that has existing assets, kind of existing MLP or something else?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I get it. Look, I think exactly the same comment applies, which is, I mean, the valuation metrics around assets and existing MLPs is pretty much the same, which is the ones you really want are very, very expensive and the ones that look like they're reasonably priced, there's usually something wrong and something we don't want. So I think the same -- all the same caveats apply. But as Joe said, we're more than willing to move on something if we find the right thing. We just haven't found it yet.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm not going to ask you any more about the MLP. But just -- since a lot of my questions have been asked, just a few quick ones. Is there any interest -- you guys have previously been in merchant power, you guys have really walked away from that, et cetera. Given where prices are and things coming up for sale, do you guys have any interest at all in that? Or is that pretty much still off the table?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. I mean, really our model now and our strategy, I think that works very well for us and that we have plenty of growth opportunities within this model is to do long-term contract and infrastructure. And so merchant business and the volatility of the merchant business doesn't really work well with our other assets. And so if we could do a long -- a 20-year contract or something and build a plant, but I don't consider it merchant, yes, we would do something like that. But to be in the market, like what happened when our DWR contract expired, is not where we want to be.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, makes sense. Just some real quick cleanup things. The Mexican taxing, did I understand it correctly that's mostly nonrecurring, that there really shouldn't be any impact going forward?", "Joseph A. Householder", "This is Joe. Going forward, it's $3 million to $4 million a year. It's 2% change in the tax rate on our pretax income, if not greater.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And then sundry items, the asset balance sort of increased again. Was there any impact on earnings for the quarter?", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "Yes. This is Trevor, Paul. Very limited there. On the sundry items, the increases there were primarily associated with the PBOP assets and the greenhouse gas allowances that increased there. So the PBOP assets and the pension assets increased by about $95 million and the greenhouse gas allowances were about $60 million and then we also had some workers' comp insurance increases there for about $40 million. Then included in there is also the Rabbi Trust. But year-over-year, that was about the same. So that was really the driver in the increase of the $263 million on sundry.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. But I mean, for the quarter, was there an EPS impact?", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "No, there was very minimal impact really associated with it.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And then just finally, your stock has moved up a lot. Any thoughts of the stock split? I know it's kind of a cosmetic question, but just since I got you on the phone.", "Debra L. Reed", "I mean, people always ask us that question. I think when Berkshire Hathaway trades as it does, you kind of feel that most of the buyers can afford the stock as it is. And so unless there's some other compelling reason, it's not something that we spend a lot of time on most likely.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kit Konolige with BGC.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of kind of cleaning-up questions. So on the dividend growth going forward. The comment was that we would potentially see a slightly faster rate of growth. Did I write that down correctly?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we had said before a 4% to 5% growth. And if you look at a 4% to 5% growth and you look at what happens when Cameron comes online with the earnings, you don't quite get to a 45% to 50% payout ratio. So we're looking at rather than wait and doing a 4% to 5%, and then waiting to have a step function increase when Cameron comes online, to smooth that a bit. So that should yield the dividend growth rate, that would be slightly higher than we would have done otherwise.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "All right. Okay, fair enough. Okay. And your discussion of SONGS, it sounds as though your expectations are pretty low for any settlement. Is that a fair assessment?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. I wouldn't assess it that way. But I really can't talk about any settlement discussions. So I wouldn't conclude that it's not possible or that it is possible, I just really can't talk about any kind of confidential settlement discussions.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Right. How about in the absence of a settlement discussion, how long -- can you be any more specific about how long it might take until we get a fully litigated result?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I can tell you what the phases are. And there's 4 phases in the case. And we have a schedule for the first 2 phases, and we just heard that the first phase is already being delayed. It was supposed to come out in February. It will be delayed now until the end of March. And so we're thinking this will certainly take through this year and probably into next year if you just look at their schedule.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. More CPUC delays, right? They never announce that it's coming sooner. And then one other area that I just jotted down. So on the impact of tax expense on the repatriation, is that going to be a steady impact in years going forward now? In other words, year-over-year, will there be any change in that?", "Debra L. Reed", "Let me ask Joe to handle that. The thing that I just would remind you all is this year, we did the IPO, so it was a little different this year and we repatriated about $200 million associated with that. Our plan called for us to repatriate about $300 million a year, henceforth. Joe, why don't you talk about the tax on that?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes. So I think what we said a year or more ago when we announced this plan was that it would go on for about 5 or 6 years and that we would have with earnings impact, which would be roughly $0.25 or up to $0.30 a share. It might move around a little bit, just depending on some issues around the tax rules, the way they work and with our other income. But it should be in that neighborhood for about 5 or 6 years, so pretty [indiscernible].", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Very good. Okay. And one final area, just to get my thinking straight on this. The growth rate of 9% to 11%. Can you give us a sense of kind of what are the building blocks there? In other words, is that simply the kind of prior growth rate plus a CAGR that would get us to the addition of Cameron when it comes online? Or are there other things going on there?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Basically we'll go through this as an update at the analyst meeting. But we showed you those charts last year that had kind of our growth rate through 2018, 2017. And then it showed, if you added Cameron to that, the 9% to 11%. That's basically what we're talking about. We basically take what our 2018 earnings would be on our base business, you added a full year of Cameron and thats what gives you kind of the 9% range. And then there's upside, as we showed you last year, in terms of additional opportunities that could get you towards that 11% range. And we'll go through those in detail at our analyst meeting.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I learned a new term today, MLP-able. Outside of the U.S., you've been doing obviously some really good building business down obviously in Central America, focused on Mexico. But I guess, maybe with that growing base of assets and maybe with a growing relationship, particularly with a partner like GDF SUEZ, do you see maybe some of these partnerships as a beginning of a larger platform for Latin America? And I guess, second part of that question would be I know your positions are already fairly strong. But is there any benefit to maybe a more formal agreement pursuing projects? Or is an ad hoc approach better suited?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I mean, I will say that we're looking at some bids that will be coming up, and we're looking at partners that would be good partners for us for those kinds of bids. And that we -- as you can see with our Cameron facility and what we've done with our Renewables business, we are not at all opposed to partnering. And especially if you can create a bigger pie by partnering, we really like that. So I think there's every opportunity that we would look at partners in Mexico, especially if we want to get into, as we would like to, some of the gathering and processing and areas like that in Mexico, it would be ideal to have a partner to work with there. And then the same thing, South America, and I would say the same thing in the United States.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe a further question on Mexico, in particular. I know it's still in progress and you mentioned the gathering and processing, and obviously gas infrastructure is kind of appealing. But do you think that there -- given some pretty, I guess, impressive growth fundamentals and investment needs, does electric distribution have any interest in the longer term for Sempra?", "Debra L. Reed", "This is something that I would just say we are watching, and that the thing that we're really watching is what happens with rate structures that really allows you to be competitive. And we think the electric businesses is a good business. They have a lot of capital requirements in that business in the long term. We have aging infrastructure throughout the U.S., so there's a lot of opportunity to invest in transmission as well. So there are parts of that business that we like a lot. And so I wouldn't rule it out. We happen to own the largest gas distribution company and we love the gas business. So with that, a lot of our growth is really focused on the gas side, as you see. But that doesn't mean that electric is not of interest to us.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, in particular, for Mexico, there's still, I guess, a lot of rate formalities as it were that have yet to be ironed out around electric distribution is my understanding?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes.", "Debra L. Reed", "That's correct.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Joe Zhou [ph] with Avon Capital Advisors.", "Andrew Levi", "Actually, it's Andy Levi. And I apologize if the question was kind of asked because I see the headlines, but I was at a different meeting, so I kind of just got back. But just on the MLP front, would you guys consider purchasing? I know since you're on the headlines on Bloomberg that you'd purchase assets to create an MLP. But would you actually consider buying a small MLP to kind of jumpstart that process?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We would consider that. What our focus will be on though is creating the greatest long-term value. And if we saw something like that, that was reasonably priced, we thought we could grow it with some other assets we have. And we would be particularly interested in something where if you combine the assets that they have with the assets that we had, 1 plus 1 would equal more than 2. And if we could find something like that, then yes, we would be open to that. Mark stated earlier that what's been shopped, usually if it's priced reasonably, it's not something we would have much interest in. And that a lot of the other things just seem already having every potential growth priced in. And so if it looks like it would be good for our long-term shareholder interest, we are absolutely willing to consider that as an option.", "Andrew Levi", "And I assume you have obviously the currency to do that, so...", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes.", "Andrew Levi", "Yes. I guess, that gives you some options, a better way to put it.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Josh Golden with JPMorgan.", "Joshua Golden", "I'm so sorry for asking the question upfront. This probably isn't the best place to ask you. But can you talk a little bit more about the LNG, Cameron LNG terminal? So from the producer side, where exactly is this gas going to be coming from? Is this more Marcellus-Utica gas? Or is it more Eastern Texas-type of gas? And I guess, I'm just sort of thinking in combination, many years ago, you guys made the acquisition of EnergySouth and the storage assets down there. So I'm just trying to think about how all this works together. And really curious, where do you see the gas coming from for this terminal?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, let me ask Mark to answer that. But I just want to be clear on one thing. We don't buy the gas through the terminal. Our customers will be buying the gas through the terminal. Basically, our contract to the terminal is almost like a take-or-pay contract with the pipeline, where when the facility goes in service, whether they use it or not, we get paid and that they buy the gas and they sell the gas. So I just want to be sure that you understand kind of the structure before Mark answers your specific question. Mark?", "Joshua Golden", "Yes, I sure do.", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay, yes. Look, I think, well, this answer is going to sound a little bit like the current administration. It's kind of an all-of-the-above strategy. Our customers are going to acquire gas both -- there will be Marcellus gas that we expect to flow south into the facility and we'll also -- obviously the Texas production will flow there as well. And there could even be Midcon and other production basins that will flow into this facility. And if you think about our facility and the other LNG facilities that are in that region, even with and coupled out with the petrochemical businesses and the proposed petrochemical plants all in that Gulf region, this is going to be a very, very large area of consumption for natural gas, and so supplies will come from all over. All of the producing regions will end up supplying this region. And we're seeing that now. And it's actually -- that's what one of the things that's creating value for not only our storage assets, as you mentioned, but also some of our pipeline assets that you might not even think about. REX is looking like becoming more of a header system for the whole north part of the country. And that header system is going to feed both going north and south. So we do think there'll be some interplay with our other assets.", "Joshua Golden", "So that's interesting. Now just one follow-up. So if you look at the basis spread differential, it's really collapsed year-over-year and hence, all the feedback storage, et cetera. What do you think will happen to basis spread differential between north, south, et cetera? I mean, do you see those increasing again? Or how do you see that shaking out?", "Mark A. Snell", "I think because we have found gas in so many places across the country, and some of those places are so close to the consuming regions, basis spread has collapsed around the country. And I think what you're going to really see is -- and like all infrastructure, we do have a lot of pipeline infrastructure, it's just some of it is not going in the right direction. So as we make the incremental investments to be able to move gas in the direction that we need it to go, you're going to see the basis kind of reduced down to the tariff on those lines.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow-up question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Real quick. I'd like to turn back to the original -- one of the original businesses, the utilities in California. Can you just talk a little bit about how the agreement with the FERC on FERC transmission impacts revenues for 2014?", "Debra L. Reed", "Sure. Let me go through exactly what the settlement is, and then talk about the impact. So it's a multiparty settlement. It's uncontested. It sets an ROE at 10.05%. And it's based upon the actual equity as recorded on 12/31 of each year. It will go from September 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. So that's gives you kind of the duration of this. And if you look at where we were at 11.3% ROE to a 10.05% ROE, that's something like $20 million to $30 million a year of impact in that production of ROE based upon the FERC assets, the FERC rate base that we have. And that has been included in our guidance. So the numbers that we gave you, we started having this effect in 2013. Once we knew a settlement was pending, we were booking to the settlement amount. And it's reflected in our 2014 guidance.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So when you say it was in the 2013 numbers, meaning that full amount was, so there's no incremental year-over-year delta? Or was part of that '13 and part '14?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. Well, the only incremental would be as the rate base increases. But it was in '13 for the fourth quarter from September 1 forward when the prior rate expires.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And on the O&M side at both utilities, I mean, you guys over the years have been one of the best, if not the best, operator at the utility level. Just curious what some of the operating efficiencies you've been able to find and how we should think about kind of directional trends from 2012 onwards for the next few years in terms of utility O&M.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I mean, I would say that we're always -- this is a constant improvement effort at our utilities, as you well know. And so last year, some of the efficiencies of operations were able to offset some of these [indiscernible] reductions in ROE and SONGS, to some extent. And we would see us continuing to work at that level of efficiency and looking for other opportunities to improve. What I will say is safety is our first priority, and we will not do anything that would reduce the safety of our service. And so that is the key focus for our people. But new technologies come in all the time. We have opportunities to change the way we dispatch workers, change the way we time appointments, change the way we use technology to answer customer calls, route customer calls. Those are the kinds of things we really focus on that can improve customer service, improve safety and reduce cost.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting Ltd.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "Regarding Energ\u00eda Costa Azul, what was the net income contribution in 2012 and '13 and also the fourth quarters of each year?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We don't break it down. We share data at segment levels, Winfried, so we would not break it down to that kind of a level. You can kind of look at the Mexico segment and see.", "Joseph A. Householder", "We've decided it's relatively stable because it's under a long-term contract, so there's very little difference between '12 and '13. So it's the same, but we don't give that kind of detail.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "Okay. And another question, if I may. What was the total foreign exchange impact in 2012 and '13 and also the fourth quarters of each year?", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "Across all businesses, it was fairly small. I don't have the number right off the top of my head. But in the fourth quarters, it was approximately $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter of '14. But I need to pull the number to get that specifically for you and not much different from that for the full year.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "Okay. And that was negative?", "Trevor I. Mihalik", "That's right.", "Joseph A. Householder", "The dollar would strengthen.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "Yes, okay. Well, if you could maybe get back to me please with the numbers, that would be appreciated.", "Operator", "And we'll take a follow-up question from Kit Konolige with BGC.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of items. On the 9% to 11% growth rate, to get back to that, what's the base EPS that you're using there? Is it the 2013 actual now?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. We'll go through that at the analyst meeting. I don't have all of that in front of me right now. We'll update all of that for 2014 through 2018, and then the show you 2019 at the analyst meeting. And I'd rather do it that way versus giving you pieces of information because I don't want to create confusion around that. And we'll have slides on all of that at the meeting.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Sure, okay. One other item, I noted that the Energen, according to reports, is selling Alagasco. You guys have been in that part of the world for a while. Do you have any interest in gas distribution in Alabama?", "Debra L. Reed", "We can't really comment on any kind of transactions like that.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Reed, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, thank you, all for joining us today, and thank you for all of your questions. We look forward to answering more questions at our analyst meeting coming up at the end of March and going through a lot more detail with you at that time. In the meantime, if you have any questions that you need follow-up on, please contact Rick Vaccari or any of the people in our Investor Relations group to help you in the meantime. And we will see you at the end of March. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude our conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2014 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 7, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to Slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. On this call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide you with key operating and regulatory updates. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $269 million or $1.08 per share. Together with the outlook for the second half of the year, we expect to be at or above the midpoint of our 2014 guidance.", "Given our strong operating performance and success in delivering planned projects on schedule, combined with the progress we're making on capturing some of those additional development opportunities, we are on track to achieve our 9% to 11% growth rate through 2019.", "Notably, our Cameron Liquefaction project has achieved several key milestones, and we expect to begin construction this year as planned. On June 19, we received our FERC order, and yesterday, we executed the financing documents and made the final investment decision with our partners.", "In Mexico, IEnova is on schedule to place and service the first phases of the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines by year-end. We are extremely proud that since January 2013, IEnova is the best performing IPO in the Americas and the second best-performing IPO worldwide.", "In Peru, commissioning of the Santa Teresa Hydro project will begin this month.", "In the U.S., REX East-to-West loads of 1.8 Bcf per day are now fully contracted. Also, this past week, we signed a power purchase agreement with Edison for a 94-megawatt expansion at our Copper Mountain Solar facility.", "On the regulatory front, our California utilities received a positive final PSEP decision in June. We are also continuing to work on the development projects that could provide additional upside to our 5-year plan and sustain our superior growth rate. Examples include LNG, natural gas pipelines, renewables and hydro in Peru and we will talk about these projects later in the call.", "Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the second quarter results in more detail starting with Slide 4. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. Sempra's second quarter consolidated earnings were $269 million or $1.08 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings of $258 million or $1.04 per share in the same quarter last year.", "Moving to guidance. As Debbie just mentioned, we now expect to be at or above the midpoint of our 2014 guidance of $4.25 per share to $4.55 per share. Let me elaborate a bit on what this guidance range includes. Consistent with our development and partnership model for renewables, we include the promote we recorded on the CMS 3 project in the first quarter and the promote we will record on ESJ next quarter for the formation of these joint ventures. We also now include the $9 million additional charge we recorded in the first quarter related to the SONGS settlement agreement. However, we do not include any possible gain on the sale of the remaining block of our Mesquite combined cycle power plant, nor do we include anything for the tax reform proposals being discussed in Chile.", "Before proceeding to earnings for each of the business units, I would like to also mention one timing-related factor I discussed on last quarter's call. Remember that in the first quarter of 2013, we recorded a $63 million deferred tax expense related to the IEnova IPO restructuring. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded $12 million of estimated deferred tax expense to reflect a portion of the planned repatriation for this year. We recorded another $12 million of deferred tax expense in the second quarter of 2014. Our estimated annual tax rate reflects the recording of deferred tax expense each quarter in accordance with the full year as planned repatriation.", "Now let's turn to Slide 5 for details on SDG&E. At SDG&E, earnings for the second quarter were $123 million, up from adjusted earnings of $115 million in the second quarter of 2013. We are really very pleased with this result as the increase was due primarily to higher CPUC-based margin and improved operating performance.", "Please turn to Slide 6. For SoCalGas, second quarter earnings were $80 million. Compared with the second quarter of 2013, SoCalGas had $9 million in higher CPUC-based margin and improved operating results. Offsetting items included a higher tax benefit in the second quarter of last year and certain cost to our Pipeline and Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP. Specifically, we incurred $6 million of PSEP costs in prior periods that were denied recovery in the final PSEP decision.", "Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 7. At our South American utilities, second quarter earnings were $42 million, up from earnings of $34 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was due in part to higher operating earnings from growth in customers and energy sales combined with reduced costs. In addition, we had a $4 million loss in the second quarter of last year from the sale of our investments in Argentina.", "For Sempra Mexico, second quarter earnings were $34 million versus earnings of $26 million in the same period last year. $11 million of AFUDC equity earnings in the second quarter largely accounts for this increase. As you will recall, we began recording AFUDC equity on the Sonora pipeline since it is an asset that has a regulated rate of return and qualifies for regulatory accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. Partially offsetting the AFUDC earnings was the effect of foreign currency translation on deferred tax balances in the second quarter of 2013.", "Now please turn to Slide 8. At Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter earnings are lower this year compared with last year due primarily to mark-to-market gains on our gas storage positions in the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter earnings for the Renewable segment were $18 million versus $15 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher operating performance and deferred tax benefits for assets currently being placed in service.", "With that, let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss Slide 9.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Joe. Now we will give you an update on our major businesses starting with LNG. As I mentioned earlier, on June 19, we received the FERC order authorizing construction and operation of our Cameron Liquefaction project. In July, FERC provided Cameron with a notice to proceed on site separation activities. Now that all FERC hurdles have been cleared, the only remaining significant regulatory step is receipt of the final DOE non-FTA permit, and we expect to receive this permit and begin construction later this year as planned.", "Yesterday, with our partners, we also executed the financing documents and completed all requirements for making the final investment decision, commonly referred to as FID. Financing commitments for the project totaled $7.4 billion and will be provided by JBIC and a group of 29 international commercial banks, some of whom are insured by NEXI. Cameron received 16-year financing and highly competitive pricing due to the quality of its lenders, sponsors and customers. The transaction represents one of the largest project financings in U.S. history.", "Now please turn to Slide 10. At our Analyst Conference in March, we discussed our interest in growing our LNG business. We are continuing efforts in this area with an initial focus on expanding existing assets. For our Cameron facility, now that we have reached FID, we will begin working with our partners to complete the development plans and initiate the FERC process for trains 4 and 5. We believe the Cameron expansion will be one of the lower cost alternatives, especially when compared to greenfield development. Our ECA LNG plant in Mexico is also well situated from a market perspective as the only brownfield facility on the West Coast. We are focused on determining the critical path items that would influence the feasibility and size of a potential export facility at ECA. These include issues around gas supply and delivery, customer interest, existing contracts and regulatory requirements. A positive development is that Mexican energy reform legislation now includes a basic framework for private sector LNG export.", "In addition to ECA, we are assessing design options and feasibility for our potential Port Arthur facility in Texas. We will provide updates on our progress periodically and are optimistic about our ability to grow our LNG business with Sempra's existing assets and capabilities.", "Now please turn to Slide 11. Our U.S. Gas & Power business has 2 other projects update. On the REX pipeline, the 1.8 Bcf per day of existing East-to-West capacity is now fully contracted. REX put a portion of this capacity in service in June, and the full capacity will be in service by next summer. All of this capacity, except 0.2 Bcf per day, represents the capture of development opportunities additional to our 5-year plan.", "On July 31, U.S. Gas & Power also executed a power purchase agreement with Edison for a 94-megawatt expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex. For this project, we would expect to achieve commercial operation by the end of 2016 and have a 50% ownership share. Under the agreement, Edison would purchase power beginning in 2020.", "Now please turn to Slide 12. Moving to Sempra Mexico. The initial phases of the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines are both on budget and on schedule to be in service by year-end. Each represents an investment of around $500 million. IEnova secured financing in June for the 155-megawatt ESJ wind project, and in July, they finalized the sale of 50% of the project to Energen.", "Regarding development projects under Mexico's 5-year infrastructure plan, official bid documents for the first 2 natural gas pipelines have been published. The first project is about 155 miles and will eventually connect with one of the proposed pipelines to be constructed in the United States. The second project is about 260 miles in northern Mexico. Tenders for these projects are due in October, and IEnova is preparing to participate in both bids. The 2 projects together would likely represent investments of over $1 billion.", "In addition to these 2 projects, 3 pipelines in the U.S. and 5 more pipelines in Mexico are planned to be tendered in 2014. Opportunities in other sectors will also be bolstered by the energy reform efforts that just passed. As one of the largest energy companies in Mexico, we are looking forward to the opportunities that energy reform will bring in sectors such as liquids transportation, gathering and processing, and power transmission.", "Now turning to Peru. We expect to begin commissioning of the 100-megawatt Santa Teresa Hydro project this month. Building upon our success with this project, we are exploring several additional hydro opportunities in the country. Luz del Sur has been granted a temporary concession on the hydropower project, Santa Teresa II, with a potential design capacity between 250 and 300 megawatts. We are progressing on environmental and feasibility studies and have begun conducting local outreach. Additionally, in southern Peru, we are assessing feasibility and design of 2 hydropower projects that can provide a combined capacity of around 350 megawatts. All 3 hydro projects are potentially large, technically sound investments, and we intend to make a decision on moving forward on these by early next year.", "Now please turn to Slide 13 for an update on our California utilities. SDG&E and SoCalGas have both been making important headway on several regulatory issues. On June 12, we received the final PSEP decision. The decision is favorable in that it adopts our overall implementation framework and approves a process for cost recovery and balancing account treatment, subject to a reasonableness review. This decision covers expenditures in populated areas, and consistent with what we reported at our analyst conference, capital expenditures are estimated to be about $1.5 billion through 2018. On July 25, we submitted a notice of intent to file the 2016 General Rate Cases for both SDG&E and SoCalGas. After CPUC staff reviews these submissions, the utilities expect to file an official application in the fourth quarter of 2014. The CPUC's final decision is scheduled for late 2015.", "Now let's finish by turning to Slide 14. In summary, we are on track for another strong year. We expect to be at the midpoint or higher of our 2014 earnings guidance. Our core businesses are performing well. We received a positive PSEP decision at our California utilities, and are on schedule with our major projects like Cameron LNG and our Mexican pipelines. We are also making great headway on some of our development opportunities. REX has additional contracted volumes and we are seeing many opportunities for growth emerging in both Mexico and Peru.", "With that, let me stop and take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So first, can we discuss REX here for a second, in the context of what's in the 5-year plan versus outside? Could you give us a little bit of a sense, what does 25% mean, just if you could define that? And then also regarding the non-binding open season, where is that shaking out as far as you've received interest, if you could comment a little bit more, if you wouldn't mind?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. I'll start, and we did put a slide in the package because we do understand the REX issues are kind of confusing. So if I could refer you to the slide and the slide number is 17. I think that would help you understand what's in and what's not in the plan. So let me kind of walk you through that.", "If you look at the Seneca lateral piece of that, that's 0.6 Bcf, and about 0.25 Bcf of that went into service in June of this year. That piece was in our plan. We expected that to happen. That was in our 5-year plan. But what has now been contracted is an additional $1.6 billion in addition to that, and that comes in over phases. The next phase of that is another $400 million or so that will come in at the end of this year and provide some upside to our plan in next year and beyond. And then the remaining 1.2 Bcf comes into service in the middle of next year. And that is, again, incremental to what we had in our 5-year plan. So this is a really positive thing for us, just with what we have under contract.", "In addition to that, there was a non-binding open season that was conducted in May, and that we're in negotiations with parties on the results of that. And we will announce the results of that when we've concluded those negotiations which are underway right now.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. Is there a timeline on the negotiations?", "Debra L. Reed", "I would say within the next couple of months, we would anticipate something coming out.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then...", "Debra L. Reed", "And again, I would just say, none of that was in the plan. So whatever that is, that was not in the plan either.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Excellent. And then moving back to the LNG side of the equation. Could you comment a little bit on where you stand on incremental contracts for both of the projects, 4, 5 and ECA? And perhaps specifically, kind of where you sit in the decision, FTA versus non-FTA?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, what I'm going to do is I'll just give you a high level, and then I'm going to turn it to Mark to go through kind of project-by-project and what we're looking at there.", "I would say, the great thing that we have is that when we look at our Cameron facility, it is a very commercially-viable facility. It's -- we think, it's really well positioned in the marketplace, and we also believe our ECA facility would be very well positioned in the marketplace. So a lot of effort is underway to look at kind of the next steps at those facilities, and then we have this wonderful location with Port Arthur, and what might we be able to do with that. So we are very focused on kind of the next steps, and let me turn it to Mark to talk a little bit about that.", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay. Well, with respect to Cameron, I think, as Debbie says, a great facility. I think the thing I would add to that, too, is the partners in this -- in the facility are world-class trading partners with extensive LNG businesses. So while we have not signed contracts yet for trains 4 and 5, we're really just beginning, just starting to think about that as we have completed FID and move forward with the constructions of trains 1 through 3. So I think that the next step for us is to talk with our partners, decide how much capacity everybody would like, and then to see if we're going to market any of it out to other parties. And that hasn't really begun yet, but I think that is something that will be in the works now that we're moving forward with FID.", "And I would just say with that facility too is there are -- the big point here is that, that facility, along with our ECA facility being brownfield sites, obviously, have a cost advantage and a construction advantage over any of the greenfield sites. So it's our expectation that the market will look to brownfield sites, ours included, but also including others and expansion of those existing facilities, first, before they really look at a lot of greenfield opportunities.", "With respect to ECA, we are undergoing studies right now to determine the amount of gas that's available for the facility and the cost of delivering that gas into the facility. And then once we kind of determine that, which we think will take us towards the end of this year, once we determine that, we'll lay out some plans for the size of the facility and start marketing to customers. We have a lot of customer interest, and we don't think that acquiring customers will be a big issue, but we haven't started that marketing yet because we haven't sized the facility, but we're in the process of looking at the parameters to do that.", "And then with respect to Port Arthur, another -- it's a great site, it is a greenfield site. We think the advantage of Port Arthur is that it's such a large site and has such good water access that the possibility of doing things beyond just LNG are there. We can -- there's other -- it's actually been proposed in the past as a crude terminal and other types of activities, and we think those activities could coexist with LNG, making it, in the long run, one of the more cost-effective greenfield sites in the country. So those are all, kind of, positives and where we're going, and then did you, Debbie, you want to comment on the process?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. You asked the question, Julien, about the DOE, non-conditional FTA. And going through the conditional FTA was really where the review, the extensive review occurred with DOE. So we would anticipate in the next few months to see the DOE, non-conditional FTA. We've seen, recently, other companies get their conditional FTAs. We haven't seen any change in criteria, so we would expect that to be coming out in the next couple of months. And then, that would allow us to begin, really, full construction on the site. But we are doing some site preparation activities. We've gotten the authority from FERC to be able to do that. And so, we're, actually, working on the site right now.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "A couple questions. First, just with the final financing terms and the like, are all the numbers you've given for Cameron 1 through 3 still, kind of, right in line with what you've said before?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. We did -- and I think a couple of things, Steve. We've given you the range of $9 billion to $10 billion. We're still in that range. And we looked at the financing, the financing came in very competitively, as I mentioned in my comments. What we're looking at now is, at the $10 billion range, being somewhere towards the middle of the range that we've given you, for the first few years of operation. And then as the loan starts to be amortized, we would anticipate that, over time, the annual earnings would be $400 million or so. So $300 million to $350 million is still a range we would see being closer to the midpoints of that range in the first few years of operation, and then we would see being in excess of $400 million after the loan starts to amortize.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. And then just -- what's the -- just to set expectation, what's a reasonable timeframe to think about potential contracting of trains 4 and 5?", "Debra L. Reed", "I can't really answer that question. I will tell you that it's something that is a big focus for us, and that we're going to put a lot of energy into it, just like we did getting Cameron done. But that -- you got to get -- you got to do the same things we went through Cameron. And the good thing is we've been through the FERC process on that site, so it's not a new site to go through the FERC process. So, kind of, telling you a timeframe on that, I can't tell you. I'm hoping it would be expedited because we've already been through the FERC process on that site, but I really can't give you a timeframe at this point.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. And then just one last question on the -- you've given your 3 kind of scenario options on MLP back at the Analyst Day. Any new thinking on those 3 options or is it pretty consistent with what you said then?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, let me have Joe talk about that because we continue to do work in this area. And clearly, with the situation with REX being as positive as it is, we constantly are looking at that. So let me ask Joe to hit that.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie, and Steve, thanks for the question. As she said, it's some subject that we spend a fair amount of time on because it's very important to us and to the shareholders. And we're looking at the MLP space and the YieldCo space, actually, and the ones that have the highest visible growth, particularly, with large drop-down portfolios, those have the lowest yields and the potential for the highest value. And so let me tell you a little bit more about that we really are doing. We're continuing to evaluate the value proposition and we're studying the legal and financial aspects of both the MLP and the YieldCo space. And as we've noted before, having the clear growth strategy for the business is a critical element. So we're very excited about our growth at Sempra and focused on executing, as Debbie said, on all these projects that we're doing. At the same time, we're focused on getting the best market value for the shareholders on this growth and that current MLP YieldCo structure offer good opportunity for that. So we haven't made a decision at this time, which of the structures is exactly the right one, but we are very focused on it and looking at it and continuing to evaluate all of these opportunities.", "Debra L. Reed", "I would just add to that. We'll look at that in conjunction also, with the timing, and as I've said before, part of the analysis is looking at, with an asset as valuable as Cameron, how does the timing set, with splits and things like that? So all of that kind of analytical work is part of our assessment.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "The first couple of questions checked a lot off my list so I'll try to be brief. I'll probably fail, but I'll try to be brief. So thinking about when the revenues are rolling in on the stuff that's not in your plan. You've been very clear that 2015, 2016, there's 1 point more Bcf a day of revenue opportunity off of the REX backhaul that wasn't in the plan. Should we assume that -- should the Clarington West open season become a commercially viable opportunity that, that would hit in the second half of '15? Or is it hitting the first half of '16 in terms of incremental revenue? What's the timing assumed on the current path to bringing that into the revenue line?", "Debra L. Reed", "The timing on the current path is sometime in the middle of 2015 as that is -- it's expected to go in service. And I think, just go through the increments again to be sure the numbers that you have are consistent. We have $200 million to $250 million in service now, and that was in the plan. We add, incrementally, $350 million to $400 million at the end of this year, and that's additive to the plan. And then, we would add the remainder to get to the $1.8 billion, which is another $1.2 billion in the middle of next year some time.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And I think you might have been asking [indiscernible].", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "[indiscernible] on the Clarington West?", "Debra L. Reed", "And then on the Clarington West, the timeframe on that is not certain because with that -- a lot of that has to do with how you design it, and what the volumes are and how you design it. So we don't know what the timeframe of that would be.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And Clarington West, if it's successful, would require more capital investment than the Seneca lateral and the $1.2 billion that you've already signed up, correct?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. There would be compression for one piece of it, and then there would be looping for the other piece of that. And for what we've done so far, the capital is really not very large at all, I think it was like $70-some-odd million, $80 million.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And the maximum size of Clarington West was another $2.4 billion? Is that -- or am I overstating it?", "Debra L. Reed", "No, that's right. That was the maximum size if you do compression and looping.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, I have one question back on the utility. You gave guidance for a range of earnings for SoCalGas of $360 million to $390 million in 2015 at your Analyst Day. I'm wondering, as you now are analyzing the rate decisions you've gotten, for instance, the PSEP decision, where you think you would come out inside that range?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, the ranges that we gave you in March of this year, we would anticipate being in those ranges for SoCalGas.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First is just a clarification. Joe, when you said earlier you're looking at different options for structures, were you saying that you're considering doing a YieldCo and having Cameron be a part of that?", "Joseph A. Householder", "I was saying that we're open -- we're looking at all of that. We're trying to determine what vehicle might, exactly, be the best, and we are keeping our options open as to what the right vehicle is. So at this point, it's open.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then, hypothetically, if you did go, sort of, down the YieldCo-type route, what other assets in your portfolio do you think would fit well? Obviously, you've got the renewables, but do any other assets come to mind?", "Joseph A. Householder", "That would be probably the primary asset other than the ones that we've spoken about before that would go into an MLP.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. What about some of the, like the Latin American assets you have. There have been a couple of YieldCos with those type of assets.", "Joseph A. Householder", "We've spoken about it a little, we haven't really done much analysis on it. It's a lot more complicated, obviously. And inside the utility, it probably wouldn't fit that well, but it's certainly something that we are keeping an open mind about.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then in terms of -- there was a pipeline that was bid, I think, in Peru a couple of months back, and I think you were disqualified or there were some sort of issues. I was hoping you can provide an update there and just some color on what happened?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I'm going to have Mark talk about what happened with that.", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay. Well, what happened was we were in a competitive bidding situation and we were in a consortium with other bidders -- I mean, with other participants in our consortium. And one of our members at the last -- kind of, at the last moment decided to change ownership percentages, and that caused us to have a technical disqualification. And so our bid was rejected, although we did open it publicly and announced it, and it was the best bid, it was the low bid, so I think would have won. And it was just unfortunate that we had this, sort of, technical problem that caused our bid to be disqualified. But I think it gave us a lot of encouragement in the sense that having gone through this process on this pipeline, and there's other projects coming up, that we were obviously very competitive. We came up with the lowest price. We think we had a better route and a better approach to the project. And so I think we're sort of emboldened to think that we're going to be very -- quite competitive in the future. It's unfortunate we have this little setback. But I think, moving forward, we look upon this, our group, as positively, as one that we can win projects down there.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question, if I can. In terms of thinking about the potential economics for an ECA or -- under Cameron 4 and 5, how similar or dissimilar would it be to Cameron 1 through 3, both in terms of the equity investment, as well as the return potential?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I'll take that. This is Mark. Obviously, the expansion is less expensive per ton of production than even the brownfield conversion to a certain extent. As you get bigger and bigger, then you start -- then it becomes less effective because you might have to add tankage and stuff. But with what we're considering, I think we would be very cost competitive. So the cost wouldn't be -- would be less than what we're currently contemplating, and I think that's what going to make it very attractive. We would expect similar kinds of returns as we would get. So I think that we would probably share those efficiencies with the market to make sure that we can sell the capacity. So I think those are all positives.", "And then with respect to ECA, a little different facility there, a little different footprint. But I think, roughly speaking, the economics are somewhat the same, but ECA would likely be a smaller facility or will be a smaller facility.", "Debra L. Reed", "Before I take another question, I just wanted to comment on something back on the REX sheet to be sure everyone was clear. On the sheet that we have at 17, it says 25% of the volumes. I just want to remind everyone that we own 25% of REX. So when we're talking about 1.8 Bcf and 2.4 Bcf, not all of that flows to Sempra. I think you all know that, but I just don\u2019t want to mislead anyone.", "Okay. We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matt Tucker of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I guess, I wanted to ask about Mexico first and how you feel about your chances on these 2 CFE pipeline bids and if you could comment on how the competitive environment for these bids compares to other pipeline opportunities that you've gone after there recently?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I'll just start by saying that we are really excited about the opportunities in Mexico, and the good thing that we have is we have the infrastructure there, we have the team there, we have the ability to get pipes to the job, we have all of that because we've done projects. So I think that, that -- why competition is probably going to be higher than we saw in the past. I think also being on the ground with the projects that we already have there provides us a great competitive advantage in terms of our ability to show that we can deliver on these projects. And then we have the 2 projects coming in this year that are on schedule, on budget, and there are not very many companies that have that kind of proven track record. So I think we're in really good position to compete, and there's a lot of projects that are going to come out, and we're going to be, as we have in the past, selective of which ones we bid on, the ones that we feel we can be most competitive.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great, thanks. And then just circling back to Cameron. You mentioned you expect the final DOE approval within the next couple of months. I guess, what's, kind of, holding that up, and what issues are they still considering? I kind of felt that like would be somewhat automatic. So maybe you could comment on that.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, like I said within the next couple of months. I mean, we're not sure. It could happen soon, it could happen -- as DOE is looking at it, I think that one of the considerations was what kind of comments would come in on the FERC issue. And since that appears to have been that there were no comments that were filed timely, that, that may change how DOE focuses on it. Certainly, Senator Landrieu has already sent a letter that was made public asking DOE to act quickly on this. And as I said, it's not stopping us from getting on site right now and doing some of that pre-work. But the sooner we can get it, the better. So we're very anxious to have DOE act quickly and hope they will.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then with respect to the possible expansion. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the construction side of that. If, hypothetically, you were able to secure commitments and were able to get the permitting process, would you be able to start construction on trains 4 and 5 before trains 1 through 3 are completed, or would you have to wait until, really, 2019 to even start construction?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. I'm going to have Mark talk about how that might unfold.", "Mark A. Snell", "No, I mean, it really -- they have to be kind of done sequentially. And it's not just the construction issue, but also the terms of the financing require us to finish the projects that are being financed first. So unless we redid some of the financing, we -- it's -- they have to be done sequentially.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So we'd be talking about something like a 2020-type timeframe, the earliest, 2021 maybe for those to come online?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, it could be a little shorter than that. I mean, one of the things we are doing, we are constantly looking at the construction schedule and the construction that we're doing and we, kind of, call it a no-regrets construction policy, which is we're anticipating further expansion as we build. So there are certain things that we can kind of pre-build into the process so that we don't have to go back and redo it. So I think we can save some time there. So it may not be quite as long a timeframe as trains 1 through 3, but it would probably be sequential.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then just looking at the 3 LNG expansion opportunities. You discussed Cameron, ECA and Port Arthur. Would you be able to, kind of, rank those in terms of both the probability and the, kind of, timeline between those 3 projects?", "Mark A. Snell", "Well, I think the reality is the expansion of Cameron is probably up there. It's probably first, but very close behind is ECA, and that's, probably, almost a push as to which one could go first. Probably -- actually, ECA could start earlier than the expansion. So I think both of those are, kind of, at least, equal. And then Port Arthur, because it's a greenfield facility, obviously, would take longer to develop, and it could be quite a big facility. So that's further down the road. I'd kind of -- but I'd keep ECA and Cameron, kind of, neck and neck.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask about the good old-fashioned utilities. When you think about -- right, like nobody's asking, and you have really, really, really strong utilities. When you're thinking about the rate cases, how material? Meaning, how big of a number are we talking about in terms of either requested revenue change or a percentage rate change if you're the -- I don\u2019t know, if you're the intervenor looking at it from the other side?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, actually, I think that's the real positive that we have. If you look at SDG&E as example, our filed notice of intent to file the rate case set forth a number of $168 million increase. And on a combined electric and gas build, that's about 1.4%. And then on SoCalGas, we're looking at a $290 million increase, and that's about 5.5% increase in a bill. But I will remind you that in both cases, the bills are already much lower than the national average. So I think that we have operated our utilities efficiently over time. I think there's a benefit in that and going in to these rate cases and asking for what we really need to operate those businesses very efficiently and have it not be huge increases in customer rates.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one question on Clarington West, kind of, the part that you're still trying to figure out, you and your co-owners are just still trying to figure out what to do with. What's the timeline for the open seasons there? And I want to make sure I understood this, what would be the potential, kind of, range of capital requirements from your perspective?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay, Mike, I'll answer the first and then I'll ask Mark to talk about the capital requirements under the different phases, if that's public and -- when I'm not sure, I guess, that's not public information. So I won't answer that part of your question.", "But I will answer the first part of your question. The non-binding open season went out in May and now, we're in negotiations with participants in that non-binding open season relative to contractual commitments. So however long it takes to secure those is the kind of timeframe that we're looking at. And that's why I said I think we would anticipate something in the next couple of months most likely.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan.", "Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Did you guys give more color on the timing of the rest of the 2014 RFPs for the Mexico pipelines? There's a lot left in there besides just the 2 that are out there already, and it looks like each one individually will take a couple months at least from start to finish.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, there's 2 that are outstanding right now, and then there's 5 more that they've announced to come out of this year, and that's what's been indicated, and that's in the pipeline side. But I would also focus you on -- there's other areas of opportunity like transmission. And so, Mark why don't you hit, kind of, what we see over the next few months?", "Mark A. Snell", "Okay. I think, well, like Debbie said, there's 2 out right now, and we're actively working on those bids. And then the next 5 that are coming out of those, 2 big ones are in the United States that are for CFE. Those will be, probably, hotly contested just because they are the MLPs and everybody can compete with those. So we expect that to be -- have more bidders than the ones in Mexico. But we do believe that we have some unique things, properties that we can bring to the bid, to our bid, and then -- and I think that we can try to -- we can be competitive, and we should have a good chance to do that. And we've had a long history, obviously, working with the CFE, so I think that should bode well in our favor.", "But then there's -- and then beyond that, there is a whole list of pipeline opportunities that are scheduled to come in -- to come out in the first half of '15. And obviously, we're even beginning to look at some of those and be prepared for those. But there is, certainly, a long list of opportunities on the natural gas pipeline side. But then we also have -- there are electric transmission projects and power generation projects, also product lines for PEMEX.", "So I mean, I think, the story here is that energy reform in Mexico is going to produce billions and billions of dollars of capital opportunities for companies that have a history of operating in Mexico, and our positioning with our IEnova subsidiary makes us probably the premier energy company to bid on these competitive projects. We're the second largest energy company in Mexico behind PEMEX, and we're really the hometown incumbent there. So I think we feel very good about our chances of being successful and participating in this reform, and we certainly look forward to continuing to grow our business down there.", "Debra L. Reed", "And just to, kind of, add a flavor of the big numbers we're talking about over time. As part of the infrastructure program that the Mexican government has announced, they've announced 15 generation projects worth $13.6 billion, 17 gas pipelines for $13.1 billion, and 7 electric transmission lines for $1.7 billion. So you're talking about tens of billions of dollars of investment in Mexico. And they're moving forward on it. So we think this is going to be a great opportunity area for us.", "Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on cash repatriation. You guys have, I guess, some potential incremental opportunities in Peru after the failure of that initial RFP for the pipeline there, and then certainly all of the opportunities in Mexico. Will there be any pause that you contemplate with brining cash back here as a result of those and how should we think about that and, kind of, what's contemplated in guidance through, I guess, 2018 now, with the repatriation?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, what we've had in our plan and what we continue to have in our plan is repatriating $300 million a year. And that -- we look at that based upon the needs of capital in those countries. As we've told you before, we have a lot of debt capacity left, and so that's what we would go to first. And then, we have the ability to issue equity in those 2 countries. We would look at that as well. So right now, what we're planning on is still the $300 million a year repatriation.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige of BGC.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "On the possibility of the MLP/YieldCo that, obviously, has been a hot topic that you've talked about and we have asked you about. Any further thinking on any kind of bridge assets that could be put into a hypothetical MLP, let's say, before Cameron was up and running? If I understood you correctly, in the past, REX alone as it was envisioned -- you wouldn't really have considered sufficient to be the, kind of, the lead-off batter for the MLP for that length of time.", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll have Joe talk about this. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Kit, while we haven't made any decisions at this point about the exact timing or asset composition, I will remind you, what we talked about on the first quarter, the things that are going on at REX that we talked about today and last quarter are really exciting because it does give us additional cash flow starting in the middle of next year that we can use in this regard. However, I did note that because we have a 25% interest in REX, it can't be the only asset that goes in there because of some 40 Act issues, so we need other assets. So what we've talked about is using some of the cash flow from REX, using -- as we get further along, obviously, the cash flows from Cameron, and now that we have FID, that puts us in great stead for that. But we have some additional cash flows from our LNG facility in Mexico that, actually, are in the U.S. and we would use those. We have some other, a little bit of midstream asset revenues not including the storage that we would put in there. And then if we did something broader, we could also include renewable revenues. But I think, given what's happened with REX, given that we now have FID, I think we have a mix of assets that we can use, as you call, sort of, a bridge to do something between now and 2018, 2019.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "So what should we assume is the earliest that you could do something given the mix that you see in front of you there? Is it some time in '15 or '16?", "Joseph A. Householder", "As I started out to say, we haven't made any decisions at this point about the exact timing, so more to come.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, we'll stay tuned there.", "Joseph A. Householder", "I'll say one other thing. Obviously, we talked about the CFE pipelines in the U.S, Mark spoke about that, and we think we have a good opportunity to capture some of that. That would be an additional help that would get us there.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Right. And speaking of assets that are being bid out in Mexico. Are -- is it your idea that IEnova would be the owner as those assets are billed or, let's say, for ECA, would there be a different company?", "Debra L. Reed", "Now everything that's located physically in Mexico would be an IEnova position. As Joe said, there are some contracts that relate to gas that are not -- that are tied to ECA but are U.S. assets. Those would remain in the U.S. But to the degree that we developed ECA, to the degree that we're doing pipelines in Mexico, those would be Mexican assets under IEnova. To the degree that some of these Mexican bid pipelines occur in the U.S., those would not be part of IEnova.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Right. One last question on tax rate. You had some discussion earlier about how the tax rate varies quarter-to-quarter depending on what's repatriated and, obviously, other factors going on, several moving parts. How should we think about the tax rate, say, an annual tax rate over the next few years? Is it going to be pretty steady for estimation purposes?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Yes, over the next several years. This year, it will be just a little under 30, and over the next several years, in the low-30s. Pretty stable.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett of Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Sorry to jump back into the LNG. You've been talking about it a lot today. I really appreciate all of your comments on it. Just wondering, it seems the agreement or the nature of the agreement for Cameron is a pretty successful one. If you are going to be moving forward with ECA or with the new Port Arthur facility, are you going to be looking for, kind of, a similar ownership structure?", "Debra L. Reed", "That is yet to be determined. And we'll look at the option that makes sense for each of those facilities. We have great respect and have worked really well with the partners that we have at Cameron, but that model doesn't have to continue on, and we would be looking at what model would make sense for us at each of the facilities.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Meaning, it's possible by the time you're ready to make that decision, you might feel comfortable taking on a project like that on your own?", "Debra L. Reed", "It depends on what kind of contracts we had. And all of that -- all I can say is it really depends. I would not preclude it, but it would have to also fit within our Sempra risk profile, and that's what we would look at.", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, I would say the thing that we would be focused on is that it would be fully contracted.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And just one smaller thing. At the Analyst Day, you also mentioned the opportunity for some re-gas, maybe in Hawaii. Obviously, not maybe as large an opportunity as some of the stuff you mentioned this quarter, but just wondering if that's something you have an idea about, maybe the capacity that, that market might demand eventually? And that's probably, I would guess, a lower priority than any of the projects that you've spent so much time discussing, already, today?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I would say, I'm going to have Mark talk about it. But I would say, one potential customer probably for ECA would be Hawaii so...", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, look, I think, the reason we mentioned it is because there is, obviously, a real need there, and this is one of those interesting situations where bringing LNG into the island would do -- would have 2 beneficial effects. One, it would be a much cleaner burning fuel source for electricity because they're using fuel oil now. And two, it would actually lower their costs because they would go from a crude-based pricing to a natural gas-based pricing. So it's really got a double benefit and a clear need, and we think the desire on the part of the Hawaiian -- of the state government and the local utilities there to move with this direction. So we think there's going to be an opportunity there, and ECA is the natural, logical supply source. So that's why it was mentioned. We don't have an agreement. We don't have -- well, we've been talking to them. We think that there's a possibility, someday, of working something out, but we don't have anything. We don't have anything firm.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "A lot of my questions have been answered, but just -- I wanted to clarify something on the DOE process. The Chris Smith proposal to, sort of, accelerate the -- to streamline the process and have them deal with the approvals at the end of -- other regulatory agency approvals. I'm sorry if I missed this, what is your expectation in terms of how that's going to proceed?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we think that's moving forward, and we're very positive on that. I mean, what we've seen in the queue is that we spent a lot of money going through the FERC process, and that it doesn't cost that much to go through the DOE process for our company, but they can block you in terms of timing for the queue. And that, we really like the idea of the FERC process, kind of, becoming the driver because that's what requires all the engineering, all the environmental work, all the things to really make the business decision on the facility. And we think that this change in process will actually help us in terms of the development of additional size for trains because we've gone through that process. And there -- I will tell you, it is a stringent process, and you can see now that are not very many companies that have made it through the whole FERC process. In fact, we're the first one that made it through the whole EIS process. So we think it's an advantage to us, as a developer, having had the experience with that for them to make those modifications.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Because the reason why bring it up is that, as I'm sure you're aware, API and others made comments that seems to be critical of that path. And I guess, you guys just have a different perspective on it. I'm just wondering if there's a simple -- I don\u2019t want you to go into anything elaborate, but I'm just wondering, is there a simple reason for that or...?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, [indiscernible] your level of seriousness on these projects is tied to the FERC process. And so, that your expenditures and your level of seriousness -- and with the process that DOE was using with every few months one coming out, you could have projects that may not get developed, may not get the financing, may not have the customers, and have not even begun the FERC process move ahead in the queue because they filed something that didn't cost them anything really to file. And so we think the FERC process, really, drives your true commitment because when you file at FERC, you have invested a lot to get there. And so we're supportive of what DOE is looking at.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, I think I understand the difference. And then on the -- just in general, we've seen some real changes in the global LNG and gas market, et cetera. And I'm just wondering, where things stand now. And obviously, you guys have a competitive advantage with the respect to recent brownfield and stuff. Just in general, what's your thought about, ultimately, how much LNG is actually exported from the country? Or is that -- I'm saying in terms of just any market dynamic outlook, did that change at all from previously, when we've talked about this? Or I'm just, sort of, wondering, when we look at this -- like you said, it seems like everybody's brother's is announcing something, and of course a lot of it isn't, probably, going to happen. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of flavor as to how you see the recent changes in the gas markets globally?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I'll ask Mark to talk more about this. But what I would say is that all depends on what the relative cost in the market is. And I mean, some of the projects that we're doing now, which are brownfield projects, are very cost competitive. One of the advantages that you have in the U.S. or that you would have in Mexico is that you have an infrastructure, and then a lot of these other places, where they're having to build their LNG facility, they're having to build the pipeline infrastructure, they're having to access the resources to the supply. There's different hurdles that go with it. So we think that our country is really well positioned on this. And it's hard to say how much of that global market we get. I do think that we can be very competitive in that global market because of some of those issues. Mark?", "Mark A. Snell", "Yes, I would say in the near term, say between now and 2020 to 2022, you'll see the development of, probably, the brownfield facilities because those will be the most cost-effective and that could be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 Bcf to -- just call it 8 to 10 Bcf a day. And I think that's what is probably likely to happen, and then given the size -- and then, I think it'll probably depend a lot on how much the world market is going to grow. I mean, right now we're talking about -- there's some estimates out there that the market for LNG could double over the next 10 or 15 years in the world market, and that, obviously, would create additional opportunities for gas-producing countries. But we've said all along that we don't -- we think other gas-producing countries, especially, ones like Qatar and others that have low-cost reserves, are going to be competitive in this market and they're not just going to seed market share to the U.S. or Canada or the North American market in general on a whim.", "So at the end of the day, I think, there will be a demand for diversity of supply, which will include North America, and we're going to see other projects get developed and get built. We believe some of those will be ours. But at the end -- but it isn't an unlimited market and clearly, I think we're not approaching it, and I think responsible developers are not going to approach this with the idea that it's never-ending. And so you'll see a lot of proposed facilities, but at the end of the day, we think the actual ones that come online are the ones that will have sold their capacity. And that capacity market is going to be -- it's going to be looking for diversity, it's going to be looking for certainty of supply, and that bodes well for the North American market, and so I think it'll continue to grow. But it's going to be 2022 kind of 10 Bcf a day sort of market and kind of grow from there.", "Debra L. Reed", "I also would say that there's just a lot of things that have been happening in some of the international gas markets that are affecting us. Clearly, what's happening in Russia has a big effect. China just announced that their development of their shale is not progressing as they had anticipated, and it's going much slower and much lower production rates and more expensive. And so I think, those factors will play out over the next 3 to 5 years, where you have greater visibility in those areas, which have a lot of impact on what happens to the LNG market as well.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thank you, all, very much. As always, we have a top-notch Investor Relations team, and that they are there to answer any follow-up questions that you have following our call today.

(Operator Instructions). At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rick Vaccari", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2014 financial results and business update. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team.", "Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Snell, President, Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.", "The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I would also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 4th, 2014 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that please turn to slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debbie Reed", "Thanks Rick and thanks to all of you who are joining us today. Our third quarter earnings were very strong and I am confident that our 2014 earnings will be near the upper end of our guidance range. We are also well-positioned to execute on our five year growth plan. As we begin today, I'd like to start off a little differently by giving you an overview of the progress we are making on key business initiatives and strategies.", "This will give you a good sense of how we expect to achieve our growth rate of 9% to 11% through 2019. Over the past few months I've been on the road meeting with many of you. Since I most often asked about our long-term growth prospects, I thought it would be helpful to start with a progress update. So today I will begin with a review of some of the projects in our five-year plan and the status of additional development opportunities that could add to our long-term growth. After providing you with this broader context, I'll hand the call over to Joe to discuss the quarterly earnings and then we will take your questions.", "Please turn to slide 4, for several years we have chartered a path to exit merchant generation as it no longer fits with our long term contracted infrastructure strategy. On October 29th we signed a definitive agreement to sell the last block of Mesquite power plant. The book value of the plant is approximately $300 million and the sale is at a premium to book value.", "We expect to close this transaction around year-end subject to regulatory approval and transfer of the existing contract. Any gains in the sale is not included in our 2014 guidance.", "Shifting to our U.S. midstream business, we now have 20 year contracts for the full 1.8 Bcf per day at East to West capacity on the REX pipeline. Due to significant additional demand for capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica, we conducted a nonbinding open season for expansion. The REX joint venture is finalizing precedent agreements with interested shippers and we should be able to report results within a few months. Other market developments that could enhance REX's long-term value include the build out of additional laterals such as the proposed Prairie State Pipeline.", "Growth in our REX distributions from these recent developments is an important factor as we consider the structure and timing for a potential MLP or YieldCo which we will discuss later on the call. In addition to REX our U.S. Gas and Power business is preparing bids for two natural gas pipeline lines in Texas that are being tendered by Mexico's Electricity Commission, the CFE. We expect to hear the results of those bids early next year.", "Now, let's turn to slide 5. A significant component of U.S. Gas and Power's natural gas strategy is to leverage our core competencies and asset positions to build a broader LNG business. The progress we have made getting Cameron Liquefaction into construction positions us well to expand our LNG footprint. In October, the joint venture for Cameron became effective. We contributed our asset to the JV and our partners made their initial capital contributions and reimbursed us for their share of development costs.", "We began drying up on our financing and issued the full notice to proceed to our EPC contractors for construction. The combination of forming the joint venture and moving from the development phase to the construction phase where we have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract is another huge step that gives us confidence the project will be successful and profitable for Sempra. We remain on track to complete all three trains in 2018.", "Moving to the next steps and growing our LNG business, our U.S. development efforts are progressing on two fronts. We are assessing opportunities to develop Cameron trains four and five and a liquefaction plant at Port Arthur and we continue to receive strong customer interest for both.", "As we advance our analysis, we will gain more clarity on the prospects and timing for development of these two projects. With regard to Cameron trains four and five, the JV is progressing with a permitting work and we expect to initiate our FERC filing in the first half of 2015. At this time, we would expect to complete the permitting process within about two years after filing.", "Since trains four and five will likely replicate the current design at Cameron, we may be able to accelerate the environmental review process and shorten approval time frames. Sempra has the contractual rights to 50% of the equity and capacity in the expansion. Unit costs should be comparable to the current project and therefore quite competitive. Our goal is to have the contracts in place and approvals necessary to allow for continuous construction following completion of trains one through three.", "For those of you who are less familiar with Port Arthur, we have a 2900 acre land position with three miles of waterfront connecting directly to the Gulf of Mexico. The location is on a deep water channel that could accommodate LNG carriers of all sizes.", "Port Arthur has been permitted in the past for both LNG and crude import facilities. We are assessing the site for the possible combined use of LNG and/or liquids export and are discussing its development with several potential customers. Initial studies suggest the site could reasonably accommodate four trains similar in size to those at Cameron as well as other uses.", "Our goal is to complete our site plan, negotiate contracts with customers and initiate our FERC filing next year.", "Now, please turn to slide 6 for developments in our international businesses. In Mexico, we are making progress on our gas studies to determine the size, structure and economics of an LNG export facility at ECA. We should have a better sense of these factors and potential timing in the first half of next year. We continue to see strong interest from potential off-takers, but since this facility is fully contracted as an import facility through 2028, we must consider the impact on contracts with existing customers and the resulting project economics before proceeding.", "Another infrastructure, IEnova is continuing to meet key construction milestones on its major projects. The first phase of the Sonora pipeline was completed in October and Los Ramones 1 pipeline should be completed in December. Together, they represent about $1 billion in capital expenditure.", "IEnova is also in the final stages of construction on the ethane pipeline and ESJ wind generation project. Near term development opportunities include the 17 natural gas pipelines outlined in the government's five-year infrastructure plan. Although the process is running a few months behind initial scheduling, the CFE is moving forward and making progress on the tenders.", "IEnova has submitted a bid for the contracted pipeline and is preparing a bid for the second. As I mentioned, our U.S. Gas and Power business is preparing bids for the third and fourth pipeline. You can refer to the appendix for additional details on all 17.", "Turning to energy reform, we see a long runway of opportunities resulting from the country's energy transformation. In addition to the $13 billion of investment expected in natural gas pipelines, the government identified $14 billion of power generation projects, $2 billion of electric transmission projects and over $250 billion of energy investments in other sectors.", "We are working to build upon our past success and become a first mover in several of these new areas of opportunity. While we expect to have increased competition for projects, we\u2019ve worked over many years to develop our competitive advantage in Mexico. For example, IEnova has the largest in country presence among competitors with over 560 local employees. Based on our large and ongoing construction program, we\u2019ve a deep and experienced team who has demonstrated the ability to deliver projects on time and on budget.", "We also have a long history of being able to work success successfully with local communities. This is essential for secure sing rights of way. Moving to Peru, our electric distribution company has received regulatory approval for a transmission plan that entails building several substations and transmission lines in Lima. The plan will require about $150 million of incremental investment from 2015 to 2017. Capital expenditures will earn the regulated 12% rate of return.", "Let's go now to slide 7. At our California utilities, both our basic operations and projects are performing well and we continue to pursue additional growth opportunities. At SoCalGas we received regulatory approval of our framework and are currently ramping up on 17 pipeline construction projects and a valve enhancement initiative, all part of our $1.5 billion PSEP program.", "The advanced metering program at SoCalGas is also ahead of schedule and we expect to have about 2.9 million meters installed by year end. As you are aware, SoCalGas has made a filing at the CPUC for an $800 million to $850 million Southern gas system reliability project designed to reinforce the gas transmission system and provide stronger access to supply points and gas storage. This is very important for both gas and electric system reliability.", "As expected, several alternate proposals have been filed, but we continue to believe our plan is superior. We expect the CPUC to rule late next year. At SDG&E, we are on track with our $1.1 billion capital plan for 2014 and received notice from the ISO that we were awarded an additional $60 million electric transmission project in our service territory.", "On the regulatory front, we have two important matters at the Commission and both are moving forward. We reached an amended settlement agreement with key parties on the Son's [ph] plant closure and expect CPUC approval this year. The revisions made to the settlement address all issues raised by the assigned commissioner and these revisions did not result in a material impact to Sempra's 2014 financial results. We submitted our notice of intent to file our 2016 general rate case at both utilities. The Office of Ratepayer Advocates recommended acceptance and we expect to file our official applications by year end.", "Let's turn to slide 8 for an update on our ongoing assessment of MLPs. We\u2019re focused on finalizing our analysis of the pros and cons of different structures. We continue to look at the traditional MLP structure as well as a variety of YieldCo like structures that are designed for growth and distributions. To simplify terminology we refer to the latter as total return vehicles or TRVs. The key issues for us include alignment with our strategies and growth initiatives, value creation for Sempra shareholders, flexibility and the potential asset mix, liquidity and size of the potential investor base and volatility and trading history of existing entities.", "We are on path to conclude our analysis by the end of the first quarter 2015 and hope to provide you more detail around our strategy at that time.", "With that, let me hand the call over to Joe to provide additional context on this topic and to walk you through the quarterly earnings. Joe?", "Joe Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. Turning to slide 9, we discuss certain factors we\u2019re analyzing to inform our decision regarding a potential MLP or TRV. First and foremost, as Debbie just mentioned, the structure must be aligned with our strategy and enhance long-term value for Sempra shareholders. The earnings per share, dividend per share and cash flow impact for Sempra are a focus of our analysis.", "If an MLP or a TRV is pursued, we will work with the rating agencies to maintain our solid investment grade credit ratings. In our decision process we will follow the same discipline we used in launching the highly successful IEnova IPO. One important factor is the asset base. In our portfolio, we have assets with long-term cash flows that are currently available for formation of a vehicle. In the case of an MLP, we could include our share of REX distributions and potentially the U.S. based contracted revenues from the ECA re-gas terminal.", "In the case of a TRV, we could include these assets as well as certain of our wind and solar assets. We also have a variety of assets we expect to be available for future growth. In either an MLP or a TRV, Cameron Liquefaction could be the asset providing the largest cash distribution growth after all three trains are online. We could also have available LNG development projects, our Cameron pipeline, other qualifying midstream and storage assets, if market conditions improve.", "Additional renewables in operation or in development as well as other non-qualifying infrastructure could also be available for future growth in a TRV. Let's go to slide 10. On this slide, we break down the key attributes often used for comparison between an MLP and a TRV.", "As you know, the traditional MLP relies on qualifying assets while a TRV could include any asset with certainty in its long-term cash distribution profile. You are likely familiar with differences in the investor base between an MLP and a TRV. Governance and tax impacts, however, are becoming more common between the two. While we were initially focused on an MLP structure, we understand that the tax shield for a TRV is essentially equivalent to the tax shield that MLP unit holders enjoy.", "For a TRV, a tax loss can be carried forward to offset potential future taxable income. Analysis suggests that similar to an MLP, a TRV's tax yield can be maintained over time through growth. With regard to potential sponsor implications, asset quality and incentive distribution rights are important for valuation in either structure. As Debbie mentioned earlier, we\u2019re considering these issues and are on a path to conclude our analysis by the end of the first quarter 2015.", "Let's now turn to slide 11 and I will conclude with a discussion of our third quarter earnings. Sempra's third quarter consolidated earnings were $348 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to consolidated earnings of $296 million or $1.19 per share in the same quarter last year. As we normally do, we\u2019re providing individual financial results for each of our business units in the section of our presentation entitled business unit earnings.", "For this call, however, I'm going to focus only on the key drivers of our consolidated third quarter earnings, beginning on slide 12. Increased quarterly earnings relative to 2013 are due largely to five items. The California utilities had a combined $13 million of increased earnings due to higher CPUC based margin and improved operating performance.", "In 2014, the California utilities had a combined $10 million favorable impact for prior year's income tax issues, compared to a $2 million unfavorable impact in 2013. IEnova finalized the sale of a 50% equity interest in. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a $14 million after-tax gain, of which of half or $7 million is attributable to the re-measurement of our retained interest to fair value. In Mexico, we recorded $14 million of AFUDC equity earnings associated with construction of the say another ray pipeline.", "U.S. Gas and Power recorded a $25 million benefit related to the release of a Louisiana income tax valuation allowance. In past years we incurred losses for operations located in Louisiana. We recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax benefit at that time, due to the lack of offsetting income. With advancement of Cameron Liquefaction and prospects for future earnings in Louisiana, we were able to release the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Partially offsetting these five drivers were two items. One item was the $24 million gain recorded in 2013 from the sale of a 50% interest in two solar projects. The second item relates to $8 million in higher income tax expense for South America in 2014, primarily related to Chilean tax reform. As I mentioned on our first quarter call, Chile was considering a tax reform proposal that would increase the corporate tax rate.", "The President of Chile signed the tax reform bill into law on September 29th, and the $6 million impact reflects the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances.", "Now let's go to slide 13. To conclude, our businesses are performing well and we are on track to execute on our five-year growth plan. Cameron is in construction and new contracts on REX are also in place. IEnova's construction on major projects is progressing on time and year-to-date earnings for Sempra Mexico operations are higher than last year, despite $16 million of higher non-controlling interest in 2014. In South America, earnings reflect a couple of items worth mentioning.", "Year-to-date earnings primarily for Chile continue to be impacted by a weaker peso to dollar exchange rate. As we have discussed previously, tariffs in our South American utilities are generally adjusted for foreign currency changes over time. Chilean tax reform also impacted earnings this quarter. Despite these considerations, our South American utilities remain fundamentally sound and show continued growth in customers and sales.", "Finally, our California utilities have their major capital programs in place and earnings continue to reflect a higher CPUC base margin and improved operating results. As Debbie noted earlier, based on third quarter earnings and our year-to-date financial performance, we expect to be near the upper end of our 2014 earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.55 per share.", "With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you may have.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Greg Gordon with Evercore.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore", "I've got one question on the quarter and one question on some of the drivers. I guess I'll start with the quarter. As I look at the summary on page 13, it looks like the \u2013 I'm sorry, not the summary on page 13, the summary on page 12 with all the items impacting the quarter. The income tax swing, the ESJ wind gain and the release of the allowance, I understand that you had \u2013 there are offsetting things that happened in the prior year like the gain you had on Copper Mountain, but as we look forward into 2015 and we look at your \u2013 the guidance range you gave for us for 2015, is that already \u2013 should we assume they contemplate such gains or losses in there?", "Debbie Reed", "Greg, let me just say for 2015 we're going to update our guidance as we always do in February. What I would just say is that when we do our guidance we contemplate what we know at that point in time. So to the extent when we gave you the guidance back at the analyst meeting in March, we knew things were going to occur in 2015. We would have put those in our guidance at that time. But we will update that guidance because there's been things that have happened since that time and we'll update that guidance in February as we always do.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore", "Okay. So that switches to my next question. As I look at page 4 of your \u2013 the guidance section from the Analyst Day, you did a pretty good job outlining what was in your aspiration and what wasn't and based on the update you've given us today, looks like on the California utilities you've got a small transmission project that wasn't contemplated. You've got a fairly large potential gas infrastructure project that wasn't contemplated. You've got the SFE pipelines in Latin America and Peru transmission that wasn't contemplated. And then refresh my memory. I just want to be clear, the 1.8 Bcf of day of REX backhaul was not \u2013 was also not contemplated in that guidance. Is that correct?", "Debbie Reed", "Yes. Let me just go through to summarize those so that everyone kind of hears the same thing. When we look at what we showed you back in March and we look at some of the things that were in the additional opportunities that have already been secured that we have the 1.6 Bcf from REX for the east to west flows and that's incremental to what we had in our plan of the 0.2 B's. We also have the second piece of REX which is the Clarington West Flow [ph] that we haven't announced contracts on yet. And as I mentioned, that should be coming out in the next couple of months.", "Renewables, we have the 92-megawatt contract with Edison for CMS-4. And on electric transmission, this quarter we got $60 million of incremental investment. We also have some other projects that were incremental to our plan at SDG&E and then we also had the $150 million of electric transmission in Peru that I mentioned on the call.", "So those are things that where we basically have either been assigned them by the ISO or by the regulators in Peru or we have contracts with REX or with renewables. Then we have a lot of bids for additional development and we're bidding two CFE pipelines in Mexico, two CFE pipelines in the U.S., some additional renewables where we are offers out and we mentioned trains four and five in Cameron. Those are things we're actively working on as well.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore", "You've also got this $800 million to $850 million gas infrastructure proposal where you'll find out late next year if that's approved, right?", "Debbie Reed", "Yes. And part of that was in the later years of our plan, because that \u2013 we would expect to get the decision towards the end of next year but construction doesn't ramp up on that until some of the mid to later years of the plan.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore", "And when would you roll out explicit 2016 earnings guidance range?", "Debbie Reed", "We'll roll those out 2016; we usually do at the analyst conference. And so we do 2015 on the call in February, generally, and then we give you both of those and then our long-term outlook at the analyst conference. And that would be \u2013 the one thing I want to be sure to mention is that when I went through all of these growth opportunities that \u2013 and using the Southern reliability system as an example, not all of these projects are going to affect 2015 earnings. Some of the projects, like REX comes in part of it in 2015, some of the additional contracts would not come into place until 2016, when we look at the Peruvian transmission it's 2015 to 2017 and so a lot of these things are going to not affect just the 2015.", "The other thing that I want to mention is that with the additional bids that we have under development, we are going to also be incurring development costs during 2015. And we are planning on getting trains four and five with the permits filed and same thing for Port Arthur and for projects like that, plus all these CFE bids that we expect there to be development costs. So all of that kind of information will be updated when we give you our guidance in February.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore", "I do have one more question. So there's been a lot of oil price volatility over the last couple months and the people's \u2013 it seems that investor's expectations for the probability of incremental LNG export kind of ebbs and flows with the oil price a as it balances between where it is today and the prices we saw earlier in the year. Is there a \u2013 can you give us some sense of whether the appetite from your counter counterparties who are discussing with you the potential for these incremental trains, at what oil price they're no longer interested in ex ordering gas from the U.S.?", "Debbie Reed", "Let me just mention one thing and that is that all of the joint venture parties agree for us to move forward with some of the initial work and preparation of our FERC filing for trains four and five. So I mean, that in itself is a good indication. But Mark has done a lot of work in this area and we expected that there would be questions on oil prices, so I'm going to turn it to Mark to kind of say why we think our facilities are very well positioned in terms of the global markets.", "Mark Snell", "Greg, I think you know that this LNG business is a long-term business and what we're seeing from our partners is an interest in securing long-term supply of LNG from the United States with all the stability and the continuity that that can provide. And we really haven't seen that interest abate even as we've seen oil prices fall in the last few days here. If you look at the underlying numbers and I'm not going to get into all the details now, but generally speaking we still have \u2013 the U.S. gas and U.S. LNG especially from the Gulf has a pretty good cost advantage over just about everything else that there is in the world today. And that continues down to gas or oil prices as they drop even down to the $70 range.", "One thing I think it's worth noting is a lot of these foreign contracts, oil linked contracts for LNG have S-curves in them with sets a floor and a ceiling on prices as oil prices fluctuate. And so it's not a point where even if oil were to drop to levels that we haven't seen in 15 or 20 years, LNG wouldn't necessarily on a worldwide basis fall to those levels, except other than on the spot market. There's some built in price levels there. And I think we're competitive with those, given where price is. And I think the other thing that's really, really important and that these folks focus on is diversity of supply. And that includes geographic diversity.", "Obviously the United States being a real favorite these days of trying to get some supply out of the U.S., also diversity of facilities and geographic locations within the U.S. So I think at the end of the day we feel very confident that our partners are interesting \u2013 interested in moving forward on trains four and five. We see other outside interest for Port Arthur. We are having discussions on, on maybe conversions there.", "So we're kind of looking at all of these opportunities and we think we can be online with some of these as early as 2020. And we're going to kind of prioritize which ones that we think need to come online first and we'll just kind of move through the list. But we're pretty excited about what's the level of interest and the opportunity for us to continue to grow our LNG business.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Couple questions, first on the Cameron four and five filing at FERC next year, would you anticipate you would have contracts in place by the time that you file at FERC?", "Debbie Reed", "I'm going to have Mark go ahead and go through that and kind of go through the schedule a bit with you as to what we're envisioning.", "Mark Snell", "It's a good question. I don't know that we would have firm contracts in place. Usually, the contracts aren't firm until we take FID, the firm investment decision, and we wouldn't expect to do that until sometime after we get the permit, 16 or 17. We're working with our partners and we obviously have customers that we have put in the queue that are looking at this opportunity, but it's sort of a chicken and egg thing. They want to make sure that we're going to do it and we have the facility and getting the permits will cement that in their minds that this facility is moving forward and I think they'd be much more comfortable than to commit to that supply.", "So as we look at this, I think we would expect sometime after that we would probably firm up contracts. That doesn't mean we won't have MOUs and other kinds of indications of interest and I think that's very likely that we will. A firm contract really doesn't exist until you take FID.", "Debbie Reed", "I would say it would be very parallel to what we did on trains one through three where we had with partners, we had commitments that if the facility was built at a certain pricing point that they would move forward with it. But that's very different than getting to FID, where the partners now have to you put their money on the table and all. So I think it would be constructed very much the same in terms of contracts.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay. Maybe my terminology might have been too specific there. I guess it seems that there's a little bit more of an interest in approving projects that have more likelihood of getting done, which having some kind of initial commitment helps along that way. So do you expect by the time you file there would be some kind of initial commitment for the LNG?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, I think that we'll have initial interest. And also too, I just want to remind you that now that FERC or that DOE has changed the way that they look at this and let FERC is taking the lead, you're not really going to move forward with a lot of this activity because it is, as Debbie mentioned, there's fairly expensive development costs in moving this through the permitting process. And so we're not going to do that without some indication of interest and that we're going to be able to move this to completion. So I think the change in the process that was recently announced a few months ago is also leading to people being much more secure about what's going on as they move forward.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay. Second question, this might be a little silly, but just do you guys have something against the term YieldCo or what's the thought or is there a message underneath kind of recalling it a TRV instead of YieldCo?", "Debbie Reed", "I'm going to ask Joe to answer that, because he and his team came up with that term as we were looking at it. I think it is pretty descriptive and kind of what the option we're looking at, but Joe?", "Joe Householder", "Look, I think, Steve, really it's us thinking pout thinking about what this is and I think the YieldCo term is a little bit funny, you think a YieldCo is something that's at a high yield. What we really see is this is going to be very highly valued because of growth and yield and so we just didn't really like the term and didn't really fit us and it didn't fit our strategy and we think that it's really a total return vehicle and that's why we are talking about that. One of the problems we had internally is we're looking at a couple different types.", "Everything we're looking at is MLP like in structure but it might be the tax is a little bit different depending on what we do so we needed a term to talk about these things that weren't traditional MLPs and this is what we came onto.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Okay. One last question with respect to just the decision on MLP YieldCo. The other companies that are moved forward with MLPs, YieldCos, the stocks generally have done well into it. Once they've actually executed there hasn't been a lot of follow-through. Do you have any kind of thoughts they the way you're looking at it, where you might either do it differently or communicate differently to benefit to Sempra holders if you go forward?", "Debbie Reed", "I think the key is that whatever we do has to bring greater value to Sempra shareholders in our minds and that we'll be able to articulate why we think that that would occur. I would say the one thing that we feel very good about is if we do something, if we don't do something, whatever we do, we have a really great set of assets. I think how a company fundamentally has long-term value is the growth, the potential on assets that they have, the ability to grow their business, the ability to really have steady cash flows that are growing and I think we're in good position regardless of the structure that we have to do that. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. And I would just turn it to Joe to talk about a little bit of what we're looking at on the shareholder value side and the work that's under way.", "Joe Householder", "Steve, this is part of the reason we put a lot of content into this call because later once we make a decision, we'll be filing some stuff and then we won't with able to talk about it. So we wanted to be able to explain how we're thinking about this, that we really are focused on the long-term value for Sempra and we wanted you to all understand what the things we're looking at. And so we've described on page 9 and page 10 how we're thinking about it, the kind of assets we're looking at, how we expect these things to work.", "And I don't want to talk about really the other company's stock values and what's happened to them but we believe that the strength of our underlying business and the execution that we have on our growth plan is going to be reflected in how our shares perform and if we choose to create one of these vehicles then as it's been with other large high quality sponsors, they're kind of small at the outset but I think that's one of the things you see is these things are pretty small for some of these large players. And so I don't think it's moving the stock much around. And it might do the same with us, it's hard to tell. Once those IDRs become significant and that value is very transparent, I think you'll see that in our stock very clearly.", "Debbie Reed", "I would just add to that and highlight IEnova and kind of what was done there and we were the first energy company to trade on the exchange and we took a lot of time to determine what was the best approach, what was the best timing, is this something that's going to bring value to the Sempra shareholders. Is it going to give more transparency to the value of those underlying assets. And we would make the same kind of considerations as we decide whether we're going to do a vehicle and if so, what type of vehicle we would do. I think you'll l see that same kind of disciplined behavior for us as we analyze this.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.", "Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan", "Could you give us a little bit more color on. You certainly talked about contracting conditions in general for LNG. You mentioned that the kind of interest remains strong. So did IEnova when they talked about it. Could you mention kind of if anything has changed for that project specifically over the past couple months?", "Debbie Reed", "I would say that, Chris, there's nothing really that's changed. We've been doing the gas study and we're completing some of the work on the gas study to look at gas availability. The issue there that's been there and we've always talked about it is that we have contracts through 2028 as an import facility. So the economics of taking a facility that, I don't know, it's about $150 million or so cash flow from that facility, and making it into an export facility, we need to look at what the benefits of that would be and that there has to be a compelling story for that.", "And so looking at gas, looking at the sizing of the facility, looking at the customers, looking at the existing customers, are all the things that we've always talked about with that facility and they're still present for us. We're working it and we're definitely working trains four and five and definitely working Port Arthur. We're working all three of them.", "Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then could you give us a little bit more color if you could on timing with ECA. I know it's hard to do at this point but you've definitely been more specific with four and five, I think, and even Port Arthur at this point than you've been down there.", "Debbie Reed", "Well I mentioned in my talking points that what we were looking at is having all the gas analysis done and then really looking at what kind of a facility could be there and having some conversations with our customers in the first half of next year. That's the kind of timing for that. There is a regulatory process. I guess the rules just came out in Mexico with some of the details on what is required in order to get regulatory approval. But it's a different process than in the U.S. So I mean, I think that within the first half of the year, just as with the other projects, we should have a good sense as to what we think about sizing, what we think about timing, and what we think about the economics of the project.", "Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then my follow-up question is just on year-to-date earnings and the third quarter specifically. There's kind of an unusually large number of one-time mostly tax related items. Do you have a sense of what a normalized number would be if you moved all of that stuff?", "Debbie Reed", "I'm going to have Joe or Trevor go through that. And I would remind you that if you kind of look year to year, last year we had a gain on CMS-2 that came in the quarter and it was almost the same size as this LA tax valuation. So if you kind of take those things out, you still see a growth of double-digit growth rate year-over-year which I think is along a path that we're intending to head.", "Joe Householder", "I think just what she said. You can pick and choose things that tend to be one-time items if you want to call them that. I would say in our renewable business we tend to have gains on sales fairly often. Last year we had $24 million in the third quarter, this year we had $13 million in the third quarter. This year we had the Chilean tax reform hit us for 6 and we had $8 million of repatriation tax. Where last year this quarter we didn't have any because it all got booked in the first quarter.", "So if you try to pull some of those out and you pull out the valuation allowance which was in our plan, but if you pulled that out and say that's the onetime item we have nearly 19% growth over last year and if you take out the tax items at the utilities, we have those all the time, they happen all the time, but if you take those out they're 14% earnings growth.", "We have very solid growth in this quarter and year-to-date the numbers are very similar. You can pick and choose. But we have very, very solid growth.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "It's actually Julien. I have a quick detail here on Mesquite. Do you have a sales price that you could disclose?", "Debbie Reed", "All we're saying that is our book value's about 300 and we sold it for above book. And we'll remind you all that the gain on that sale is not part of the guidance, so --", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "Turning to Mexico, if you will, how much does the U.S./Mexican project drive a decision between MLP versus whatever else you you've contemplated? Call it YieldCo, total return vehicle, etcetera.", "Debbie Reed", "I don't think that that would drive anything in terms of our decision making. We're looking at kind of long-term and so it would be a nice factor for if you were looking at either of those. It would be a nice factor, but it's not a driver.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "So you feel like you have sufficient critical mass to get the MLP off the ground, irrespective of near term project awards, right, just to be clear?", "Debbie Reed", "We're not going to comment on that. As I mentioned, we're doing the assessment of that and we're looking at those assets. We're looking at where our growth is and we're doing that, all of that work, and I'm just not going to comment on specific assets.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "And then going back to the notion of a total return vehicle, you talk about other infrastructure assets. Broadly speaking, what else would be contemplated within a TRV, if you will? It's midstream, clearly, it's renewables, clearly. What else within the context of your current portfolio or within the context of your organic growth plans would be included potentially?", "Debbie Reed", "I would refer you back to Joe's comments, but Joe, do you want to kind of articulate that again, some of the comments.", "Joe Householder", "Sure. Really what we looked at is the strategy for Sempra and it's been consistent for many, many, many years now, long-term contracted infrastructure and we've built and contracted many different kind of assets. And while we're exiting merchant generation now, we certainly had assets like that that could have been put in there. We might look at petrochemical kind of assets, other things that are natural gas related kind of assets. There could be things that just don't fit in the qualifying asset characterization.", "And so we could \u2013 I mentioned before, while we're not currently contemplating it, we could put some of these non-U.S. assets in there. We certainly probably won't do that with Mexico but there's others assets that we could put in. It's just a broader group that fits nicely with our strategy.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "And a last little detail here, congrats on Mesquite, first. But secondly, TDM in Mexico, is there a thought process or time line around re-contracting that asset?", "Debbie Reed", "We have a goal to do something with TDM on a long-term basis. And as I mentioned in my comments, with the energy reform going forward that generation will be kind of one of the next areas that they will be looking at. And we think with TDM interconnected to Mexico it could be one of the best and most economic assets to meet some of those needs. So that's our plan is to work that with the sale into Mexico.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "Under long term offtake presumably?", "Debbie Reed", "A sale of the asset or sale or long-term offtake, PPA agreement, whatever structure seems to work best.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Just wanted to follow up and make sure I understand about the offtake agreements on Cameron trains four and five. So you've indicated that you expect to start the FERC filing process the first half of next year and I believe you said that you would expect to have some offtake agreements in hand before you go to FERC. So is the implication that you expect to be able to announce some form of offtake agreements in the first half of next year?", "Debbie Reed", "Yes, let me have Mark go through that again to be sure that it's very clear what we're talking about. And also kind of the schedule at FERC, because you make a pre-filing and then you make the complete FERC filing. And so let's kind of walk you through what we're thinking.", "Mark Snell", "Yeah, I think where we're going to be is we will start the filing process at FERC with our application. And we would not expect at that moment in the first half of or the first quarter of 2015 to have agreements in hand. As I said before, actually firm agreements would not be done until we actually reached FID, which is a year or so down the road.", "But we might have indications of interest and I think you can \u2013 by the very nature of this project, the fact that Mitsubishi and GDF are our partners and they have agreed to move these process forward, they obviously have an interest in that capacity. So I think just by the nature of the players involved, you can see that there's interest in moving the project forward.", "But no one's has made a commitment yet to sign on and pay for the \u2013 to pay for these facilities to be built in a firm way. But we're going to move forward with the permitting process. We're going to get that started. We've authorized monies to be spent on development and we think the project looks very favorable compared to others that could be considered. So we're very optimistic that this project will move forward. It's certainly one of the lowest cost projects that you could possibly do in the region because it's an add-on to an existing project.", "Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "So I think I understand. It's a point at which you get \u2013 when you get to the point where you'd be making the full FERC filing, at that point if you don't have some kind of nonbinding let's call it offtake agreements, you'd put the brakes on the project at that point?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, there's certainly a point if we thought that the interest in the facility was waning or that we couldn't reach a full FID decision, obviously we'd stop spending money on it. We're not in that position right now. We feel like it's got a lot of interest and we're willing to spend some development dollars on furthering that and bringing that \u2013 bringing the project to fruition.", "This is very, very similar to what we did on Cameron's one through three. It's really the same process.", "Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "You announced the offtake agreements for trains one through three before the FID. So I guess I'm just trying to understand if we should expect a similar announcement of those agreements.", "Mark Snell", "Yes, before FID you'll have agreements that require FID as a condition precedent for those agreements going forward. But that's a very typical way that this would be done.", "Debbie Reed", "If you look back at Cameron one through three, what we had is kind of an MOU with the parties on the joint venture agreement and then the tolling agreement in that case. And then we went forward with some of the more costly developments to allow the FERC filing after we had that to make the full filing at FERC that is necessary for your permitting. It's the same type of process that we would be looking at here, whether it's offtake agreements for LNG or it's a tolling arrangement, we would look at having some type of MOU in place with interested parties before we started spending a lot of money.", "Mark Snell", "The only thing here is that we're a little further ahead because things like the tolling arrangements and all those agreements have already really been drafted once. They just need to be amended for the additional capacity.", "Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then shifting gears to the MLP versus TRV debate. As you walk through the criteria, it really sounded to me like the TRV was the superior option on most of the criteria that you walked us through and largely because of the flexibility it provides. Is it fair to say that's the way you're leaning?", "Debbie Reed", "We're not leaning anywhere. I just made real clear because I could give you some reasons why the MLP would be interesting too. So what we're trying to do is really look at this without getting hooked on anything and really do kind of the step away, look at this from a Sempra shareholder perspective as what is the best decision and to take our time to do that and to have that completed by the end of the first quarter. So there's no leaning one way or the other. We're looking \u2013 all options are open for us right now and we're watching how things trade.", "We're watching how our growth goes and what kinds of assets that we think would be available for each vehicle if we decided to do a vehicle. All of that work is under way and we'll have that concluded by the first quarter.", "Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "At the Analyst Day in the Spring I believe you said that your plan was to do an MLP and it was just kind of a matter of timing and that was before you start talking about the TRV option. Should we still be thinking of this decision in the first quarter as just which vehicle you're going to do or what's the likelihood that you decide to do nothing?", "Debbie Reed", "I'm not going to comment because we haven't decided. Like I said, there's really options on the table, all of those options are open right now and I don't ever recall saying that we were committed to doing one thing. We had looked at it. There had been a lot of interest in us doing it. We saw that we had assets that we thought would be very good assets for that type of structure and we still feel we have really good assets for either of these kinds of structures. So we'll make those decisions and inform you when we made the decisions after the first quarter.", "Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And didn't mean to put words in your mouth, just one final follow-up to that. You kind of alluded to a pipeline of renewables projects that could contribute to growth if you go the TRV route. Could you just talk to us a little about what's in your renewables pipeline right now and if the pipeline, what is included in your current long-term guidance?", "Debbie Reed", "Yes. If you look at our renewables business, the areas where we still have a lot of opportunities for development are with our Copper Mountain facility and we can keep adding there. We also have rose month which we have actually are participating in some RFPs to develop that site right now. There are opportunities to expand some of the wind sites that we're in and we're looking at some of the additional phases on those wind sites. And so \u2013 and then we're always out in the market, looking at other opportunities for exciting new renewables.", "So we have projects that we keep working on. I think where we actually have some land positions we're in really great position to develop renewable projects in those sites.", "Mark Snell", "The only one you didn't mention was Mesquite, create a large facility at Mesquite that we could expand.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just two quick ones, on REX, did you note the potential for some additional opportunities outside of the Clarington west part of it? I think you noted some laterals there.", "Debbie Reed", "What I talked about is the Prairie State Pipeline that Telegraph [ph] and AGL have proposed that links in to REX. And if they're doing a nonbinding open season on that pipeline, that ties into REX and takes gas into kind of the hub of Chicago. And obviously if they get a lot of interest on that pipeline they're going to need upstream supply. And so we have \u2013 in the 2.4 Bcf of potential expansions for REX, there's two pieces. There's the piece of about 700 to 800 a day that's from additional compression and then the remainder of it would come from looping the line. And so to the degree that there's more downstream market for the gas, then we think that that gives us additional upstream opportunities on REX.", "Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And then just switching over to Cameron four and five, as it relates to the FERC process, what drives the time line for approval and what's the potential for accelerating it, given that you've got Cameron one through three already approved?", "Mark Snell", "So if your question is on the regulatory side, how does the process work, I think the answer to that is that it \u2013 the FERC process will drive it and the DOE export process kind of will play off of the FERC process. Under this new regime, the DOE will consider only projects that have gone through a certain amount of the FERC process. One of the things that we talked about was that we may be able to accelerate the FERC process because we have trains one through three.", "We may be able to do what they call an environmental assessment as opposed to a full environmental impact report. And that could shorten the process by several months, really. And it would be a little bit cheaper, too. We don't know that we're going to be able to do that. We're looking at it. We're talking with our consultants on it. But that is one way that we could shorten the process a little bit.", "Does that answer your question?", "Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "It does, Mark. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisal Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Just going back to this MLP versus YieldCo. Is there any reason why you don't do both? The reason why I'm asking, is you don't know if you look down over the next four, five years if you're going to grow your midstream and natural gas and refined product exports, whatever you guys want to do, if you want to grow that asset base that's where the MLP works, if you're going to grow some of the stuff outside the U.S. and the renewable stuff then certainly YieldCo works.", "I'm just trying to figure out, it seems like we're talking about one versus the other but I'm just trying to understand if you couldn't do both.", "Joe Householder", "We think that either can work. I don't see us, and we said this for several years, I don't see us doing a separate YieldCo for our renewable business. Our renewable business is a nice business but it's not a big part of the business and I think that the YieldCo would be too small. It just wouldn't be sufficient of a vehicle and so I don't see us going down that path. But I think that the TRV vehicle or the MLP can work for us and that's why we're looking at both of them very hard.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Just on REX and Clarington West, I just want to make sure that was I thought contemplated to be a 2.4 Bcf a day expansion, I noticed in your slides it says TBD. Is that because it could be bigger or could be smaller?", "Debbie Reed", "It's largely because there's two pieces of it and we did the nonbinding open season and as I mentioned that we're in the final negotiations with the shippers that participated in that nonbinding open season. We'll announce that later. But if there's additional market pull in Chicago, that that may get all the way to the 2.4 and there's options, always options to expand beyond the 2.4 if you get to that. So how close we get to the 2.4, I think will be more visible to us over the next year.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "And then just on the LNG strategy, you said that you guys are going to get reimbursed for the development cost for one and three. Did I hear that right on the call? Is that \u2013 how does that cash come back to you?", "Debbie Reed", "We did. When we went through the FID and through the lets call effective date which is when all the asset goes in and the financing is arranged and everything, then we did get reimbursed from our partners for our share of \u2013 or their share of the development cost. And then we also got their first contributions to their equity going in to match our equity which was our basically billion dollar asset that we put into the JV. So now we're starting \u2013 that's our equity contribution. They'll continue to make equity contributions until they get up to the levels to match our equity value. And then we\u2019ve the sharing arrangement for all of the costs as we go forward.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And then for the marketing of volume for trains four and five, how competitive is the environment today, the contracting environment? There's still other facilities out there, some of them Brownfield, some of them greenfield, that are still being developed and just want to understand sort of what you guys commercial inertia is right now in terms of finding customers?", "Debbie Reed", "I would say that the one thing that we found is that there is a lot of parties in the market. There have not been very many parties that have gotten through the process and into construction. And so the fact that you have a facility that is already being built, that can be expanded or that you've demonstrated your ability to get through all of those processes and get a facility in place, I think provides us a strong competitive advantage in the marketplace. There are a lot of players out trying to market that buyers really want certainty, because if they are contracting for long-term supplies on a certain date to be delivered, then they're counting on that gas to get there, that LNG to get there and they're not delighted with some of the projects that may never get done. So I think we're in a good position. I think, yes there is a lot of people out there marketing but I think we're in a very good position.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "And then just in terms of what happens if one of your JV partners wanted to opt out of the expansions at four and five?", "Mark Snell", "Sure. There is provisions within our agreement that would allow the other partners to take over their position if we so choose to.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. On a pro rata basis or just whoever wants is or \u2013 ?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, it's effectively pro rata.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Understood. And then last question from me, just with the stronger U.S. dollar, just trying to figure out if there's any sort of longer term impacts to your earnings from overseas?", "Debbie Reed", "Joe, do you want to discuss that? We have been seeing FX effects and that is something that we commented on and it's clearly impacted our South American businesses this year. What I would say is that if you look at those businesses, the growth and some of \u2013 we're able to offset some of the impact of FX by the growth in those businesses. But it has been an impact.", "Joe Householder", "We're really pleased with the continued growth we have in the customers and the energy sales in both countries, as Debbie just mentioned, and the utilities are performing as we expected them to and continue to grow. But this quarter the currency movement wasn't very significant but for the year in Chile a lot of that currency movement is offset the growth but not in Peru. In Peru the currency is more stable and we have really solid growth there. So overall between Chile, Peru and Mexico it hasn't been very material this year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Financial", "Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss this. You mentioned the two Texas pipelines. Had you talked about the size of those and what that would be volumetric, I would say?", "Debbie Reed", "Yes actually, what I would refer you to, because it's a little bit confusing with all these pipelines that are being bid, if you go to slide 22 and 23 in your package it lists all of those pipelines. And the two in Texas, three and four on page 22 and it shows that both the mileage and the CapEx that was estimated by CFE, that's not our CapEx number, that's the CFE estimate of CapEx so that will help you look at all of those pipelines. And then the ones listed below, five through 17 are the ones that they've announced that they're going to be bidding in the near term. And you can see all of those are supposed to go in service by 2018, so they will need to bid them in the near term.", "Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Financial", "On those CapEx numbers actually, with the estimates that are coming out from the government, are those coming I guess in practice on the ground as these first round of pipes are being constructed, how accurate are those figures?", "Debbie Reed", "Yes, I think it's not in our competitive interest to comment on their pricing estimates. So I would just say sometimes they're good, sometimes they're not so on track. And I'm not going to say anything more about it.", "Debbie Reed", "Well being that there are no further questions, thanks again for joining us today on Sempra's third quarter 2014 earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact our great IR team and have a wonderful day.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Financial and Operational Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We also have the heads of our 2 California utilities, Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive of Southern California Gas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to Slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed", "Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who are joining us. 2014 lays a strong foundation for our future growth. We have solid financial performance, achieved double-digit annual EPS growth and posted earnings exceeding our guidance. We also achieved important milestones on development projects and delivered strong operating results across all of our businesses. With the great progress made over the year, we are on track to be at the upper end of our expected 9% to 11% earnings per share growth rate for 2014 to 2019.", "As a reminder, we have our upcoming Analyst Conference on March 26, and we hope to see all of you in New York. At that time, we will update our 5-year earnings projections and discuss our plans to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. For today's call, I am going to focus on a summary of our 2014 financial results and recent operational accomplishments that will help us to achieve our long-term growth plan. I will then hand the call over to Joe to explain the fourth quarter earnings, our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range and our 2015 dividend increase.", "Please turn to Slide 4. This morning, we reported 2014 earnings of $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2014 earnings were $4.71 per share, representing 13% annual growth over 2013. We had strong operating performance across the company that contributed to this result. Several fourth quarter factors also drove earnings above our expectation from the last call where we stated that we expected to be near the upper end of our 2014 guidance range. The major factor was tax reform in Peru that was implemented on December 31. Peru lowered its corporate income tax rate, which reduced our deferred income tax liability and resulted in an $18 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the CPUC approved our energy efficiency awards for both utilities earlier than we had anticipated.", "Looking to 2015, we expect Sempra's adjusted earnings to be within the range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share, excluding 2 items Joe will discuss later. We also received Sempra Board approval to increase our annualized dividend to $2.80 per share, a 6% increase.", "If you look back over the last few years, our dividend has increased nearly 80% since 2010, and we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders.", "Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an overview of key accomplishments at SoCalGas and SDG&E.", "Our California utilities are spending capital consistent with approved programs. The utilities have also received important regulatory decisions in 2014 that established the framework to guide investments in programs like the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP. In November, the CPUC approved the SONGS multiparty settlement agreement that resolves the cost recovery issues on the plant closure. Also, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their 2016 General Rate Case applications with a proposed decision expected by the end of this year. In December, the CPUC approved a 1 year extension of the utilities cost of capital rates. The extension keeps the authorized returns on equity of 10.1% for SoCalGas and 10.3% for SDG&E intact through 2016. It also keeps in place an automatic adjustment mechanism should interest rates move beyond a predetermined band.", "Operationally, SoCalGas installed nearly 1.8 million advanced meters last year and is ahead of schedule on their program to install nearly 6 million advanced meters by the end of 2017. Both utilities are ahead of schedule in implementing their pipeline safety enhancement plans as well, having already tested or replaced over 30 miles of pipeline last year.", "Now let's move to U.S. Gas & Power on Slide 6.", "Key milestones reached last year on the Cameron Liquefaction project include reaching the final investment decision, or FID; forming the joint venture; and getting the project fully into construction. With permits, financing and the lump sum turnkey contract in place, we remain on track to complete all 3 trains in 2018.", "In December, the JV also filed with the Department of Energy for FTA authorization to export an additional 2.95 million tons of LNG per annum on trains 1 through 3. We expect to file for the non-FTA export permit this quarter. These higher volumes match the maximum design capacity of the plant approved by FERC, and permits would allow us to export additional LNG during periods when production levels exceed the 12 million tons per annum already approved.", "However, just to be clear, while this can provide upside, we do not expect the plant to produce at the maximum capacity on a routine basis and additional production is unlikely during startup and the first few years of operation. If higher volumes can be produced that Cameron's customers use for export, we could see earnings upside in the future of approximately $30 million for each 1 million tons produced.", "Work on our 3 major LNG development projects also continues to move forward. This week, the JV partner submitted the FERC prefiling and DOE FTA export application for Cameron trains 4 and 5. The filing would add a combined LNG capacity of approximately 9 million to 10 million tons per annum. We expect to submit the full FERC filing later this year, which will initiate the detailed environmental review process that should take approximately 12 to 18 months to complete.", "At Port Arthur and ECA, design, regulatory and commercial activities are ongoing. For Port Arthur, we are working to prepare our FERC prefiling. For ECA, we announced the signing of an MOU with PEMEX last week. The agreement signifies our intention to cooperate on the development of the export project and explore the possibility for PEMEX to participate as a customer, supplier and/or investor.", "For all 3 development projects, we have been meeting with a large number of potential customers and continue to see demand for LNG supplies in the 2020 to 2023 timeframe. We have also been on the road, speaking with many of you, about our competitive advantages in providing low-cost reliable LNG to the market. Our U.S. and Mexican LNG projects are very compelling, even in today's lower oil price environment. And Sempra is one of the few developers who have successfully contracted, permitted and financed a liquefaction facility in North America. We plan to provide an in-depth discussion on our development projects at our March Analyst Conference, and we'll have the President of our LNG business, Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, there to answer your questions. Let's now go to Slide 7.", "For our Natural Gas segment, converting REX into a bidirectional pipeline was a positive long-term development last year. As you know, 1.8 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity on REX is now under long-term contract. 1/3 of this capacity is in service, and the remaining capacity should be online mid-2015. In addition, the REX joint venture has made progress on finalizing precedent agreements with interested shippers for expansion of east to west capacity. The expansion would likely occur through additional compression and would be subject to regulatory approval. We are expecting any day to receive our FERC approval of the 1.2 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity that is already contracted. Once that approval is received, we hope to provide additional details on the expansion project.", "Shifting to our renewables business. In the fourth quarter, we added our 75-megawatt Broken Bow 2 Wind Project to a joint venture with ConEd. With this transaction, we have successfully partnered with ConEd on over 700 megawatts of renewable power projects, including 7 different solar plants and the Broken Bow 2 Wind Farm.", "Please turn to Slide 8. In Mexico, IEnova has progressed on construction and is now generating earnings on sections of both the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines placed in service in 2014. Together, these 2 pipelines will provide nearly 3 Bcf per day of import capacity to Mexico.", "IEnova was also awarded the first natural gas pipeline tendered by CFE as part of Mexico's 5-year national infrastructure plan. The associated CapEx is $300 million and the pipeline should be in service in the first half of 2017 under a 25-year, dollar-denominated take-or-pay contract. Since our last call, the CFE has put out tenders for an additional 4 pipelines in Mexico, representing an estimated $1.8 billion in investment. One of the bids is due next month and the other 3 bids are due in May. For your reference, we provide updated information on CFE bids in the appendix to this presentation.", "With that, let's move to a discussion of the quarterly earnings in more detail. Before I hand the call over to Joe, however, I want to comment on the status of our total return vehicle, or TRV, analysis. We have indicated that we expect to complete our analysis on a preferred TRV structure by the end of first quarter. We are continuing several different work streams in this respect. As you know, nearly all of our midstream and renewable assets are owned in partnerships and there are numerous accounting and legal aspects we must deal with for those assets. We will provide you with more information on our TRV preferred structure at the analyst conference.", "Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder", "Thanks, Debbie. Turning to Slide 9, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were very strong. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $297 million or $1.18 per share. We recorded an additional $12 million after-tax loss in the fourth quarter for the early closure of SONGS, making the total SONGS-related loss in 2014 equal to $21 million. Excluding this loss, fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $309 million or $1.23 per share.", "Full year 2014 earnings totaled $1,161,000,000 or $4.63 per share. This compares to 2013 earnings of $1,001,000,000 or $4.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2014 earnings per share were $4.71. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings per share grew 13%.", "Similar to last quarter's call, we provide individual financial results for each of our businesses in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. Today, I'm going to focus on the key drivers of our consolidated fourth quarter earnings, beginning on Slide 10.", "Fourth quarter adjusted earnings increased over the same period last year, due in part to $33 million of benefits in 2014, coming largely from 3 items.", "First, in December, the Peruvian Congress approved gradually lowering the corporate income tax rate from 30% in 2014 to 26% in 2019, and that was signed by the President on December 31. We recorded an $18 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter as a result of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities.", "Second, U.S. Gas & Power recorded an $8 million after-tax gain from the sale of a 50% equity interest in the Broken Bow 2 Wind Project.", "Third, SDG&E had $7 million of increased earnings from higher CPUC-based margin and FERC regulatory operations. Partially offsetting these items were $7 million of net benefits in 2013. SoCalGas had $20 million of lower income tax expense in 2013, primarily related to resolution of prior year's income tax items and higher flow-through deductions recorded in that year. Netted against this amount is $13 million of deferred income tax expense for Sempra Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2013 that related to Mexican tax reform.", "With regard to foreign currency-related effects, we did see a $16 million reduction in South American earnings over the course of 2014 due to the depreciation of local currencies against the dollar. However, this impact was almost entirely offset by foreign currency-related effects and inflation in Mexico, where depreciation of the local currency decreased our deferred tax-related balances and increased our earnings.", "Now please go to Slide 11. Turning to our guidance for 2015, we are setting our adjusted earnings guidance range at $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects a number of factors, including higher utility earnings, new revenue on the REX pipeline, a year end forecast for South American currencies and the fall of natural gas futures prices that may reduce our gas storage and marketing revenues. Our adjusted guidance range excludes 2 items.", "First, as we indicated last quarter, we are not including the expected gain on the sale of the second block of our Mesquite Power Plant. The estimated earnings impact for this sale ranges from $0.12 per diluted share to $0.15 per diluted share.", "Second, we expect to incur some development costs related to our 3 LNG projects, Cameron trains 4 and 5, ECA and Port Arthur. Advancing development projects to the full FERC filing could cost up to $25 million per project. However, at this point, we do not know the timing or the amount we will spend, the total cost we will share with our partners or the breakdown between the amount we may capitalize and the amount we may expense. We believe that excluding the development costs for these 3 projects gives better clarity into the ongoing results of our business since earnings from these efforts will likely only be realized in 2020 and beyond. We will be disciplined in our approach regarding development spending, and we'll periodically update you on our progress. Amounts expensed will be reflected in our GAAP numbers.", "We expect to have more updates on LNG projects at our Analyst Conference in New York on March 26. At that time, we will also provide updated 2015 guidance on a business unit level, as well as our long-term projected growth rate.", "With regard to the dividend, the Sempra board voted to increase our annualized dividend by 6% to $2.80 per share. Given our target payout ratio of 45% to 50%, this increase allows for a smoother path towards payout in 2019 when a full year of Cameron Liquefaction earnings is expected to begin. The increase in the dividend reflects the confidence we have in our long-term growth, and it's consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend. To reiterate Debbie's message at the beginning of this call, our underlying businesses are performing well. We are executing on our development projects, and we are on track to achieve results in the upper end of our expected 9% to 11% earnings per share growth rate for the period 2014 to 2019.", "With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question today from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First one is when you look at the impact of FX for fiscal year '15 versus fiscal year '14 using the assumptions that you're making, year-over-year how much of a headwind is that?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm going to have Joe address the FX issue. As you know, we have FX going one way in South America and FX going the opposite way in Mexico, because the Mexico FX is related to Mexican tax code. And since we have dollar-denominated contracts in Mexico, but we pay the tax in the peso, it kind of creates a natural hedge. But I'll have Joe talk about the 2014 to 2015.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Greg, thanks. It creates some modest reduction in our South America utility earnings because we're using the year-end forward curve for the year, and that creates some downward pressure. But we've seen in the last several years that the Mexican tax pretty much offsets it. But we don't -- we're not providing any details at that level. [indiscernible] it's 1 million -- it was $1 million this year.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Okay. So all things equal, you're not building in a big headwind from FX net-net?", "Joseph A. Householder", "No.", "Debra L. Reed", "No.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Okay. I just wanted to be sure.", "Debra L. Reed", "And let me just be clear that when we do that, we look at the forward curves and we look at what is -- what the market curves are and that's what we put in our plan. So we don't do numbers that are not consistent with what the market curves are.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And the natural hedge from this, as I said before, works really well when all 3 currencies kind of move in tandem at the same time, and that doesn't always happen, but that's what we've witnessed the last several years.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Just a question with regard to the growth rate and going to kind of the upper end of the 9% to 11%. Is that on the basis that you gave at the Analyst Day last year, where you're only including Cameron for 2019? Or is that on kind of a more normal basis where you're including all the businesses for 2019?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. When we gave you the 9% to 11% last year, it was looking at the composite growth rate for Sempra as a whole, and it includes Cameron trains 1 through 3. And we're going to go through this in detail with an update at the Analyst Meeting. But as I said in my prepared remarks, with where we are now and some of the additional project opportunities we've already contracted, like pipelines in Mexico, the REX uplift and all, we feel that in the 2014 through 2019 period, we would be towards the upper end of that range. And we will go through how we get there. And I think you'll see at the Analyst Meeting that we have quite high visibility to the achievability of the upper end of that range. And then we also have quite high visibility of some additional upside that could either make that range higher or could extend that beyond 2019. And we'll talk about all of that in detail at the Analyst Meeting.", "Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. And then my other question is just, I'm sure at the Analyst Day, you'll talk more about the LNG export environment for new contracts, but maybe if you can give us a little sense of the likelihood that -- when should we expect that you might have some kind of commitment to MOU for additional LNG export growth for Cameron 4 and 5 or others?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, I think you should maybe use the process of 1 through 3 as an example of how it's most likely to roll out for 4 and 5. And you have to basically come up with a conceptual design of the facility to be able to kind of price out the facility. That's kind of what where we are right now with our FERC prefiling that we just made on trains 4 and 5 at Cameron and our DOE FTA filing. And then that's when you can really start your commercial activity because you have a project you can talk about that has some conceptual framework around it. So the active marketing really begins right around now, and we have had numerous contacts with customers. And on -- about all 3 of our projects, there remains a lot of interest, as I said in my remarks. And we'll talk about the groups of customers and their interest in each of the projects and what drives their interest in each of the projects in more detail at the Analyst Conference. Mark, did you want to add anything to that?", "Mark Alan Snell", "Yes, the only thing I would say is that we are talking actively with customers, but we need to do some of this preliminary work and engineering so that we can get a better ballpark on what the pricing and cost will be. It's very hard for them, obviously, to commit to something if they don't know what it's going to cost. We're highly confident that, especially with trains 4 and 5, that we'll be a low-cost provider and we think that will position us well for additional volumes. And then with -- at ECA too, as well, we believe we can be a relatively low-cost provider given both the existing facility and the transportation advantages that being on the West Coast has. So I think we're coming into the market with 2 projects at least that are -- that should be at the low-end of the cost scale of what people are looking at. And then we have a big opportunity at Port Arthur to build a kind of a big facility, and it could even be a multiuse facility. So I think we're pretty excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us, and we think as we progress during this year with the studies and the engineering work, the things that we need to do to get permitted, that we'll be in a good position to sign up people.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the last question. If we look back to the 2012 process for trains 1 through 3, could you just walk us through kind of the ultimate offtake agreements there? I know there were just commercial development agreements at that time, but my understanding was the 3 counterparties were each signed up for 1/3 of the ultimate capacity and that they did not, at that time, know what they would do to sell that gas in any kind of firm way. So does that differ at all from this time around and where you are in the process now", "Debra L. Reed", "No. I think the process would be quite similar. I mean, we filed our FERC prefiling and our FTA at DOE, and then that helped define the project. And then a few months after that, we had the MOU, I think it was actually about 6 months after that, 5 months after that, we had the MOU with those parties. And we had the structure that's framed up for Cameron's trains 4 and 5, because it's very much like the structure of Cameron's trains 1 through 3. So Mark, do you want to just go in more detail?", "Mark Alan Snell", "Yes, to give a little -- to shed a little more light on that. So when we did the first 3 trains, we've started the FERC process and went through this, and we had agreements with partners that, subject to certain conditions, they would sign up for firm capacity. And so we're moving -- as we move through that process and as we got various permits, including our non-FTA, we got our fixed price construction contract and we got a handle on ultimate delivery, those we met some of the conditions precedent and then those commitments to take that capacity became legally binding at a point in time. It'll be similar to that here. The difference here is that we already have all of the operating agreements in place. We know how the facility is going to operate. We know how we're going to share costs. We have all of those kinds of agreements done. So a lot of the heavy lifting has been done, and it's really a matter of our partners marketing the extra capacity that they -- the extra LNG that they would produce, and ourselves, because on the expansion, we have the right to take 50% of the capacity subject to the same operating and arrangements that are in trains 1 through 3. And so our plan is to do that and for us to sell that capacity or LNG in the market, and we're working to commercialize that option. So it will -- it's very similar to the first one, but it is slightly different.", "Debra L. Reed", "The other thing that I would say different this time, is the first one it was Sempra doing this, and now it's the joint venture that is doing this. And so the decision that was just made to make these filings was the joint venture partners in addition to Sempra making the decision to move forward.", "Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just to be clear, that point of kind of legal no return for the counterparties to commit after the different kind of domestic logistical hurdles were reached was the MOU, not the commercial development agreement?", "Mark Alan Snell", "Yes. Actually, the point of no return is typically the -- what we call FID, the Firm Investment Decision. So when we sign a contract to extend the construction to trains 4 and 5, when we commit the contracting dollars, at that time we'll be making a firm investment decision and we'll have all those commitments in place. That's usually quickly after that MOU kind of opportunity.", "Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to transition back to the expansion of trains 1 through 3, I guess you mentioned that with the FERC process you had known how potentially big it could be in terms of capacity. But then when you filed the DOE applications, you did not know that or you filed for a smaller amount. Was there kind of a political ramification to that where you wanted to be more conservative and not raise a red flag? Or did something change on the kind of engineering and design or end market side that made you want to expand it?", "Debra L. Reed", "No. This something that you're seeing with most of LNG facilities. When most of us filed at DOE, we filed based upon what you thought the actual average annual production was going to be. So at that point, we filed at 12 Mtpa. And then at FERC, they really wanted the nameplate capacity of the facility, which for us, for those 3 trains, was 14.95. And so we got the approval at FERC for the 14.95. We went back, and now, are reconciling the DOE permit to that. And you've seen that from several other of the parties that have already gotten their permit. In fact, I think Freeport just got there the other day for a reconciliation of the 2. So it's fully expected. Others have gotten it. It's not anything other than how the numbers were calculated.", "Operator", "Michael Weinstein with UBS is next.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Given the recent outcome in the CFE awards and considering that, along with the growing solar portfolio, just wondering how those 2 things impact your decision on TRV versus MLP? And how it might be coloring the decision one way or another?", "Debra L. Reed", "We're going to talk about our structural decision at our Analyst Conference, and we're going to go into all of those details at that time. I would just say that we're very much aware of our assets. We're very much aware of how those assets might fit into the structure. And what we're looking for, as we're looking at structures and the possibility of whether we go forward with this or not, is to -- what adds the greatest value to the Sempra shareholder and what structures would align best with our strategy? And so, we'll go through that at the analyst meeting so that you can have an understanding of how we're thinking about it, and I'd prefer not to say anything further today.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow up on the expansion in the capacity of Cameron trains 1 to 3, just wanted to clarify that you had not included that capacity in the earnings guidance you've given previously? And then secondly, how does that capacity work with respect to your existing contracts? Would that be -- does that fall under those contracts? Or would these be like spot cargoes? If you could just comment on that.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. First, let me say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, that these trains 1 through 3, the incremental capacity from those trains happens after the facility is up and operational and producing where you don't have as much shutdown, you don't have as much opportunity, I mean, for maintenance and things like that, and that you have greater production. And that would go beyond the 5 years in our plan. And so the numbers that we've given you, where we gave you $300 million to $350 million a year on average, that's what we would still anticipating in the early years of our plan. And then over time, we would be able to have some uplift potential, providing that we can manufacture from the plant more than the 12 Mtpa and that our customers are willing to take that and export that. And the terms of that have all been part of our original contract, how that gets calculated. And as I said that we just gave you a rough number of, if you added 1 Mtpa per year of export, that, that would be about $30 million upside to us when it would occur. It's not in our planned numbers, it's not part of the $300 million to $350 million, it's upside to that, but it would not be in our 5 year-plan period. So that's why I try to make it clear because we made these filings, they're public. We wanted to be fully transparent and ensure you understood exactly what we were doing.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And then could you comment on how your discussions with potential customers for your LNG expansion plans as well as your confidence in the viability of these projects has changed in light of this recent drop in oil prices versus the discussions you were having when oil was in the 90s.", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. The thing that I would say is first off, the buyers of these facilities are looking at 20- to 25-year contracts. So spot oil prices are not a determining factor for them in terms of looking at a long-term investment in these facilities. If that was the case, gas prices have gone down a lot, too. But how our customers look at this is they look at having a portfolio of LNG assets to meet some of their needs. The world demand in LNG is expected to increase considerably over the next 10 years. And they're looking at having LNG that can provide that need that gives them some optionality. And the things that have been really good about the U.S. projects are that they allow freedom of destination for export, which has not been true with some of the other contracts. And probably even more importantly than that, they have a liquid hub with upstream development that's already been there, with a robust pipeline infrastructure, with -- E&P work that someone else is paying for. And then they have a Henry Hub tradable point. So from the standpoint of our customers, they're very interested in having the opportunity to acquire LNG that has that kind of flexibility to it, and that's what we hear back. And then what we also hear back is that some of the customers like Port Arthur, because they could take equity there and that they could do a multipurpose facility. Some of the customers like Cameron trains 4 and 5 because they feel that it would be -- it's one of the lowest-cost projects that's been done and that for Cameron trains 1 through 3, 4 and 5 should be somewhere similar and that they see this optionality that I talk about. And some of them like ECA because they like the idea of a West Coast facility that could be built and access markets without going through the Panama Canal. So you have customers with different interests and different needs for the facility. And there's been a great deal of customer interest in the facilities. And LNG and oil are not fungible fully, so that Tokyo Gas is going to need gas. They can't use oil. So it doesn't really matter what the cost of oil is in that regard. And so I think there's too much connection to that because of the way pricing was done. The other thing I would say is that many facilities, if you looked at the price of oil today and you looked at tariffing on that basis, they could never get built because their just cost to build that facility would not be justified on an oil-linked price today. So if anything, we think it improves the competitiveness of some of the projects that are in the U.S. Mark, do you want to add anything to that?", "Mark Alan Snell", "I would just summarize by just saying on the -- you've got 2 parts to this, the consumption side and on the consumption side, natural gas, once you've made the commitment to natural gas as a fuel for generation or industrial usage, you're not switching back and forth between oil and natural gas. So the price of oil, other than the old crude-linked formulas, is really the only connection. It doesn't have that. And then on the supply side, there is a big advantage to the U.S. LNG because the biggest advantages -- the commitment that you need to make to buy LNG from the U.S. is less than it is than in most other places because all of the upstream development's already in place and you don't have to commit to pay for that over 20 years, it's already there. So you're really only committing to the facility, and that's a big advantage for customers on the supply side. So I think if you just think of it that way, you'll see that the U.S. LNG will remain competitive for a long time.", "Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask one more on the Mexico pipeline opportunities. You talked about the roughly $1.8 billion in CapEx on these upcoming 4 bids this year. I know you've said in the past you're not baking any of that into your long-term earnings guidance. So from that perspective, anything you get would be upside. But I suspect you'd be fairly disappointed if you don't win anything. And if that's fair, what would you be happy with? What -- how can we kind of gauge success on those bids?", "Debra L. Reed", "What I would be happy with is to get them all for the kind of returns that we would like to have. So I mean, that's -- it's not how many we get, it's how profitable they are. And we run our business to provide shareholder value. And when we lose a bid, we look at it and we say, would we have wanted to have it for that? And most times I will tell you, we say no, that's not something we would have done because we have other ways we can invest our capital that will give us higher return. And so for us, it's about the discipline and the biddings and about -- we would be, obviously, disappointed if we don't get some of these. But as you've correctly stated, we don't have these in our plan, so it would be upside.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "On the -- just a couple of questions on the operating results and then some broader questions. First question, on SoCal, SoCalGas, I understand the sort of movements around taxes there and the tax benefits last year versus this year. But if I go above the line to sort of operating income or EBIT, or even for that matter, operating margin, it looks like year-over-year in the quarter, it looks like, basically, operating profit was flat year-over-year. So I mean, I'm just trying to see how the growth is coming through at SoCal with all the capital you guys are spending in the business?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes. I'm going to have Joe talk about that. But I will say that 2014 was kind of a transition year. We were waiting for the PSEP decision to come out and starting up on a lot of the CapEx that you're going to start seeing flowing through the plan. So let me have Joe talk in particular about the year-over-year. And then Dennis is here, and he can talk about kind of what he's looking at and some of the changes in 2015 over 2014.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Faisel, yes, when you look at the tables -- I guess that's what you were looking at, is the tables.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, the supplementary tables.", "Joseph A. Householder", "And one thing that these tables -- yes, one thing that they don't show is that last year, we had still some of the retro income from the rate case delay, and so these throw you off. When you look at that, it looks like $124 million, $124 million. But last year, there was income in the numbers from the retroactive piece. And so they actually do have nice growth from year-to-year and the taxes -- between the 2 utilities, we had like $20 million of tax benefits last year and $21 million this year. It just happen to be between the 2 utilities. If you look at the 2 utilities in total, there's nice growth. But I'll let Dennis respond if there's anything else in there. But you had at least $25 million in revenue impact last year from the retro and some depreciation impact. So actually, their numbers look better than they do on the sheet. Dennis?", "Dennis V. Arriola", "Faisel, what I'd say is with the capital that we're spending and as Debbie mentioned, in '14, we're really well-positioned for the growth that we're going to see in '15. With PSEP now fully charging forward, you're going to see a full year of earnings related to that. And with the acceleration in advanced meter, that's continuing to go well. The other thing is by accelerating the Advanced Metering program in 2014, we did incur some additional operating expenses there that we won't necessarily have in years -- in 2015 as well. So when we look at those 2 programs plus the continuing growth in AFUDC related to projects like our Aliso storage replacement, we're really confident that the range that we gave out in 2015 [ph] at the analyst conference, we're on track for that for earnings.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Faisel, this is Joe. It just occurred -- dawned on me. I was actually really thinking about the annual numbers, because the retro piece was in the first quarter. It wasn't in the fourth. But I think the points that Dennis just made addressed the fourth quarter. If you look at the annual piece, I still think if you back out the retro, it looks okay, it looks good.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Okay, got you. And then if I look at the EPS guidance you guys laid out today for '15, what's the assumed sort of tax rate in that number? I think you may have mentioned it and I may have missed it in your prepared remarks.", "Joseph A. Householder", "This is Joe. The tax rate for 2015 is about 29%.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then going back to the, Debbie, your comments on the extra 2.9 million tons of potential LNG capacity at the plant. So the 12 million tons is what you have contracted. So I just want to make sure I understood this, so you'd have to actually contract for the extra 3 million tons to your existing customers, is that what you were saying in your remarks?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'll have Mark go through kind of how that works.", "Mark Alan Snell", "Okay. So if we're talking -- you're talking about the extra tonnage because of the sort of the de-bottlenecking the extra nameplate capacity? Okay. Yes, we actually -- that extra tonnage was contemplated when we did the agreement. So we get paid for making that available. If we make it available and it's used, we get paid a specific fee for that. And that's the calculation that we gave you that said it's about $30 million per ton per annum. And so we won't get that all the time. It will be intermittent. It -- because you do have to maintain these facilities, so there will be some times we'll be taking the facility down and it will earn less in its nameplate capacity, but we will have opportunities to really exceed it. And when we do that, we have a formula for getting paid.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. And then last question for me, just as you guys are thinking about sort of the performance in the stock, which has been great over the last 12 to 18 months, and sort of the -- everything you guys have lined up for the next several years, how are you guys thinking about acquisitions at this point? I mean you've seen some volatility at least in the midstream sector. I mean, what's your philosophy right now on acquisitions? Is the table sort of set and you don't need to -- you're not interested in anything? Or does it make sense to go out and look for things?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, we always look for things. And I think that with the markets having a little bit of instability right now and watching what's happening with some companies who really need to raise capital and are looking at getting rid of certain assets, that this is a good time for us to be shopping if there are some good assets on the market, and we look all the time. But what we look at is assets that will add value to the shareholder or give us a strategic advantage where 1 plus 1 equals more than 2, and that we really are very particular. As you said, we have a great growth rate that is just based from the organic growth that we have in our business. We are in a wonderful position where we don't have to make acquisitions in order to grow. So the way we look at it is, is this going to be a benefit to our shareholders? Is it going to add to our portfolio? Is it going to give us greater long-term growth? Or is it going to give us the opportunity to extend our growth beyond our 5-year period significantly above our peers? And that's the way we look at acquisitions. So if we find some things, we're always interested if they fit that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess, the one reason why I'm asking is that a lot of the growth that you have -- you've got set up right now for the company over the next few years or several years, for that matter, is -- are sort of acquisitions or sort of investments you made sort of many years ago that are sort of driving a lot of that growth. So like how do you guys think about trying to set up for the next decade with the portfolio you have?", "Debra L. Reed", "That's a great question, and we actually have a team that's working on beyond 5 and what are the things that we should be doing to create the foundations for future growth. And that is part of our strategic review process that we're going through. I mean, not -- I guess not too many companies are fortunate enough to have the visibility 5 years out to the growth [ph]. And what we want to do is set it up so that we have visibility not just 5 years, but 10 and 15 years out, and we are already working on that. It's a great question.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "So you've talked a lot about the Cameron project. I did want to flip it a little bit back to some of your comments about the opportunity in Mexico. You've kind of addressed this a little bit, but when you're looking at the bid process, you've obviously been successful, you have a recent success, and you're looking back on some of the bids you didn't want and why you didn't get them, talking about the returns process. But just wondering if how does it -- how final does this bidding process feel to you at this point? Feedback from the CFE, improvements that you'd like to see. Is there anything, I guess, in the process itself that would make it, I don't know, would make it easier for you to evaluate these projects?", "Debra L. Reed", "I'm going to ask Mark to answer that. We've gone through the full analysis of the bids and I would say that the -- that the bidding process is a pretty solid process, from what we see. And it's pretty clear. And I would say the U.S. pipeline bids were not as clear at the beginning, but they became clearer towards the end. The one thing that I think, and it was said on our IEnova call today, that we're all having to look at a little differently, is that when they bid these pipelines, they bid them to a certain capacity. And what many of the bidders are doing is looking at beyond that capacity that's going to be contracted and what is the market potential to add compression or to broaden the opportunities on the pipeline. And so I think that's one thing that we're seeing from bidders now is that they're looking not just at the first contract, but what could you do to grow that. Mark, do you want to...", "Mark Alan Snell", "Yes, I'll just elaborate a little bit on that. I would say one of the things that we're seeing from the bid process as a whole, it's actually quite good. It seems to be relatively -- it seems to be fair. They're looking at the right things and they kind of break it into 2 parts. There's a capital part and then the net present value over the future payments that the customer would take, whether that's CFE or PEMEX. So they've done this in, I think, a logical way. But to Debbie's point, one of the things that I think that will necessitate winning bidders to do in the future is to anticipate some additional revenue and capacity that would be used by the market, because all of these will be open access pipelines. They will eventually attract other customers and you got to kind of figure that into your net present value of your cash flow stream. And so, I think that it's going to keep a competitive process for Mexico. I guess the thing that I would add to that -- so I think we're looking at that and I think we can make adjustments for that. But I do think the thing that's most important is we've got these other group of bids that are coming out here shortly, but we have a whole list of other projects that are going to come out during the year. And the most encouraging thing we've seen is, in spite and maybe because of the drop in oil prices, the need for outside investment in Mexican infrastructure continues to grow. There seems to be no reluctance on the part of CFE or PEMEX to get moving on some of these projects because they're critically needed to deliver gas into the bowels [ph] of Mexico, and we really want to make sure that those projects that they're developing down there that are going to use this gas are all moving forward, and they are. And so I think all of this speaks very well for the additional investment. And we are, even though that we watch our returns and we want to make sure that we get a good return on our investment, we're still in one of the best competitive advantage -- in one of the best competitive places to be from having an advantage of just being the incumbent and the largest incumbent. Our relationship with the contractors and the pipe producers and the things that we've been using in Mexico, really, I think, we can be very quite competitive, and I think we'll do well.", "Debra L. Reed", "So one other thing that we didn't mention is that in addition to the 4 pipelines, they're also putting a bid out for gas supply at Baja Sur. And in that, they're allowing you to construct how you would get the gas there, whether it's by pipeline or it's by LNG. And I think we're starting to see a little more breadth in the type of bids that are coming out, and that pays to our sweet spot -- plays to our sweet spot where we can be creative in how we use the assets that we already have in Mexico and we take those and work them together in a way that puts a really attractive package on the table. So I think we feel very good about this, but we also are going to be very disciplined.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great. Now that's some really nice commentary. I appreciate that. And maybe to kind of pick up where you mentioned on the competitive advantage side and given how successful you've already been and seem to be so far, I mean, does that kind of change the appetite for maybe partnering with other large multinationals in pursuing some of the larger projects? Is that still an option that you are considering when you look at particular -- the larger bids perhaps?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, I mean, we always look at partners. But what we want to be sure is both partners bring something to the table. In terms of just bringing capital to the table, we feel that we have great opportunities in Mexico to raise capital for this. But if there's something strategic that they bring to the table, that combined with us, would make us more competitive, we'd certainly look at that.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting.", "Winfried Fruehauf", "Assuming the market price for LNG produced at Cameron is petroleum-based or petroleum-related, and assuming current petroleum prices would remain at or below current levels for 5 years, would this, in your opinion, affect the ability and willingness of the offtakers to proceed under the terms of the contract?", "Debra L. Reed", "If you're talking about the trains 1 through 3, no. I would not expect that. I mean, we have a very tight contract. The other thing, and the way we structure trains 1 through 3, is our customers are our partners. And so we had envisioned that if there was upturns or downturns in the LNG market, the fact that they're paying theirselves is an advantage under this. And so what you have with this is you have some, as you're pointing out, some credit risk. I certainly think GDF, Mitsui and Mitsubishi are very strong credits and that they look at this as a long-term investment for them. So I wouldn't see that, Winfried.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just on the -- almost all my questions have been answered, and I apologize if I missed this, but the non-capitalized development costs for the additional LNG projects, what was the amount that you guys are seeing, that you guys are expecting, for that in 2015? And how should we think about what that might look like going forward in the future?", "Debra L. Reed", "Okay. I'll ask Joe to answer that one.", "Joseph A. Householder", "Paul, the reason that we are excluding it from guidance, as Debbie mentioned, are severalfold. But we actually are not able to estimate it right now, and that's why we didn't give a number and we didn't put a range for it, because we expect to be spending this money, but as Debbie said, we're going to be disciplined. We also have partners in these projects, and so we are not sure at this point in time how much we're going to spend versus how much we're going to collect from partners. And then as we work through getting customers signed up for MOUs, at some point, we'll be able to capitalize the costs. So we just -- we cannot, right now, estimate the amount that we may ultimately spend. Mark, I don't know if you have anything to add that you'd like to.", "Mark Alan Snell", "No. I think that's right. We really just can't estimate it now, and because of the difference in capitalization or expense, we just thought it would be best to exclude it.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So you're just calling it out...", "Debra L. Reed", "One thing also, I just think from a transparency standpoint that you'll be able to see this because we'll be reporting earnings and you'll be able to see, as we're reporting, how much we're spending. And then -- so it makes it more transparent to you, and I think that's a positive way to handle it. When you can't really estimate something and it's something that's really leading up to your FERC filing, and then you guys will be able to see.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. I understand that, I don't want to make too much of it. I just was sort of wondering though, how long do you think this will be a separate issue that you guys will be calling out, just the...", "Debra L. Reed", "No. I mean, what we're looking at is we're looking at getting the filings done this year on all of these. So this is the expenditures that would occur before the filing and a lot depends on, as was said, when you get partners, when you get MOUs and what the capitalization policy is versus the expense policy. And the fact that we have 3 going at one time this year is quite unusual. So I wouldn't see this as being an ongoing thing and it's really expenditures for projects that really will be beyond our 5-year plan, so.", "Mark Alan Snell", "Paul, one thing is, if we develop these projects beyond this year, likely, all these costs will continue to get capitalized.", "Operator", "And next is Ashar Khan with Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Debbie, one thing, as you go out -- and we look forward to the Analyst Day, but we had one in the beginning of the year for the company. But I hope one thing which would come out is you're doing your strategy is on this Total Return Vehicle, me being a Sempra holder, is how does this enhance my valuation when you select whatever that is? And I'm hoping it is through a better growth rate in earnings or something like that which you can quantify that this vehicle would provide valuation uplift to the parent company, which has been somewhat missing in what we saw earlier this year. I hope that comes out very clearly as you pursue this path that we, as Sempra shareholders, what are we going to get by having this TRV vehicle?", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, if we decide to do a TRV, then how we explain that -- we have heard this from a number of our investors and it is one of the most important things on our mind in consideration about this. And if you go forward on it, is where is the value creation for the Sempra shareholders? Where does that come from? Obviously, that -- there are all sorts of rules regarding communication and what you can do and what you can do when. And if we decide to go forward with this, we have to comply with those rules. But we hear you. And that if we decide to go forward, that I hear what you're saying, and that we will make every effort to address it.", "Operator", "And Michael Weinstein with UBS has a follow-up question.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up. I think you were alluding before to a possible decoupling of LNG pricing from oil pricing, given the drop in oil on the spot market. I'm just wondering if that is indeed what you're trying to say and what you're seeing out there, that we might be seeing a natural decoupling?", "Debra L. Reed", "Yes, to some degree. I'll have Mark talk.", "Mark Alan Snell", "Yes, it's -- look, there are numerous LNG contracts around the world that are linked to oil prices and they call it the crude cocktail price or you've heard those terms. But the change that's coming, that's happening is really not one of a decoupling, but it's diversification which is going to -- that's entering another mix into this, and that is a Henry Hub-based LNG price. So most of -- in fact, all of the LNG so far, I think that's been sold out of the United States, has had some kind of index back to Henry Hub. So it's giving the purchasers a mix in their portfolio of a different pricing, and that was very popular, obviously, when crude was very, very high. But the popularity hasn't diminished because crude has gone down in price. I think there is a big desire by the -- especially the Japanese and the Koreans, to diversify their pricing mix and to have some different points -- different pricing points. So I think that's purely what it is. And it's a very small percentage now of their overall mix. It's growing. But we're not anywhere near where they are full up with Henry Hub-based price. I think there's still a lot of room to go.", "Operator", "And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn it back to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed", "Well, thanks, again, for joining us today. I hope to see you all at our Analyst Conference in New York on March 26. As you heard today, we have a lot of interesting things to be covering at that conference. And in the meantime, please feel free to contact our IR team and have a great day.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our conference for today.

The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 5, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rick. I'd like to start this morning by thanking all of you who were able to join us for our March Analyst Conference in New York City. I appreciate all of the useful feedback we received. At that meeting, we outlined our five-year plan and how we think about our growth and opportunities looking forward.", "The key themes of the conference were: we have a five-year base plan that is built on conservative assumptions and provides a high degree of visibility to our earnings projections. Our base plan is expected to yield approximately 11% compound annual earnings growth from 2015 to 2019, and we have already identified $7 billion to $8 billion worth of growth opportunities that could provide upside to our base plan.", "In addition to those opportunities, we are working to advance our three potential LNG development projects that could provide earnings post-2019. For those unable to attend the event, you can find all of this information in the Analyst Conference Presentation on our website. And for today, you will see that we are already making progress executing on our strategy.", "Moving to our financial performance. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $428 million or $1.71 per share. When comparing earnings on a quarterly basis, please keep in mind the impact from applying seasonality to SoCalGas earnings beginning in 2015.", "Dennis discussed this item at the Analyst Conference and showed that substantially all of SoCalGas' annual earnings will now be reported in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Though seasonality will not affect full-year 2015 earnings, it resulted in $113 million of increased earnings in the first quarter, relative to the same period last year.", "Absent this impact, we still had a very strong start to the year. And our financial results kept us on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Our California Utilities provided outstanding operating performance and across the company, we have made progress on our base plan projects and development opportunities.", "For today's call, I will begin with a brief regulatory and operational update before I hand the call over to Joe to discuss our first quarter earnings in more detail. Joe will also take a moment to clarify elements of the TRV discussion we had at the Analyst Conference. Hopefully, this will help further address some of your questions.", "Please turn to slide five. A key priority for our California Utilities this year, is to achieve a successful regulatory outcome for the general rate case. Since our last earnings call, the GRC was reassigned to President Picker, and the schedule for public hearings was established. The schedule calls for the issuance of a draft decision by year-end.", "On April 2, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, ORA, submitted their report on our GRC requests. ORA recommended that our requested 2016 revenue requirement, be reduced by approximately 9% for SDG&E and 7.5% for SoCalGas. ORA also recommended that both utilities receive inflation increases for 2017 and 2018 of at least 3.5%.", "As we explained at our Analyst Conference, our GRC requests were pretty modest and take into account good cost management. ORA's report is focused on issues they have raised in the past, and their suggested reductions are not as large as prior recommendations for California investor-owned utilities, likely due to the prudent requests we made. After evaluating ORA's report, we will file rebuttal testimony and commence settlement discussions.", "Now, please turn to slide six. In April, we also received a proposed decision or PD on long-term rate reform. The PD entails comprehensive reforms to residential rates intended to make them more fair, transparent and reflective of actual cost-of-service. The PD includes a reduction in the number of tiers from four to three this year and down to two tiers next year. Rate differentials between the tiers would gradually be reduced from 2015 through 2019.", "To ensure all customers contribute some amount to cover utility fixed infrastructure costs, the PD includes a $10 monthly minimum bill provision. It also allows for consideration of a customer fixed charge as part of a 2018 utility filing on proposed time-of-use rates.", "The PD calls for implementation to begin in July of this year with more significant changes beginning in 2016. While we see the direction of the PD as favorable, we will file comments encouraging the CPUC to go further, faster.", "Let's now go to slide seven for a business update. Regarding our base plan activities, I am pleased to announce that the binding open season for expansion on the REX pipeline has concluded, and we now have a 0.7 Bcf per day of capacity contracted for 15 years. The expansion will be achieved primarily through compression, with an estimated total cost of about $530 million at the partnership level. We expect the project to be in service by year-end 2016 and to provide us with about $10 million of annual earnings that are already included in our base plan.", "Shifting to our Renewables business, Copper Mountain Solar 2 and 3 are now both fully in service, bringing our total renewable operating portfolio to about 970 megawatts.", "Regarding development opportunities not in our base plan, we recently acquired the 78-megawatt Black Oak Getty wind project in Minnesota. The wind farm has a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Minnesota Municipal Power Agency and we expect the project to be in operation by year-end 2016.", "In Mexico, we will participate in the next round of CFE pipeline bids. Currently, the CFE has three pipelines, with bids due in May through July that represent total estimated CapEx of around $1.3 billion. The CFE has announced two other projects with bids expected this year that represent another $1 billion of investment.", "We discussed at the Analyst Conference our continued interest in these opportunities, our competitive advantages and the potential for adding capacity commitments from industrial buyers. For your reference, we provide updated information on CFE bids in the appendix to this presentation.", "As a final note, I am pleased to announce that we completed the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite Power Plant in April. In the second quarter, we will record an approximate $34 million after-tax gain on the sale, subject to working capital adjustments. As we have discussed previously, this gain was not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance. Sempra will receive approximately $350 million in proceeds, which we will use to pay down short-term debt.", "With that, please turn to slide eight for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $437 million or $1.74 per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $428 million or $1.71 per share.", "Adjusted earnings exclude two items. First, we recorded a benefit of $13 million after-tax from a reduction to the loss on the SONGS plant closure. The reduction reflects the CPUC's approval in March 2015 of SDG&E's revenue requirement associated with the SONGS settlement.", "Second, as we have previously noted, we will be adjusting earnings for expenses related to the development of our three proposed LNG liquefaction projects. In the first quarter of 2015, we recorded $4 million of after-tax expense.", "Debbie mentioned at the start of this call that compared with 2014, first quarter earnings now reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas' revenues. This change alone increased earnings by $113 million relative to the first quarter of last year. The application of seasonality in revenues for SoCalGas will result in substantially all of their earnings being recorded in the first and fourth quarters. But it will not affect the full-year earnings result.", "We discussed this change at the Analyst Conference, and provide an updated illustration in the appendix that shows how seasonality would have impacted quarterly earnings in 2014, using our effective tax rate.", "Excluding this impact, operating earnings at SoCalGas still increased relative to the first quarter of last year. Combined with strong operating performance at SDG&E and solid results in our other businesses, we had a very strong first quarter and they're on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance.", "Please turn to slide nine. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled, Business Unit Earnings. I'll address here the key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter. In addition to the seasonality impact, first quarter adjusted earnings increased over the same period last year due in large part to $30 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities that reflect higher CPUC and FERC margins, net of operating expenses.", "In addition, Sempra International recorded $11 million of higher earnings, primarily from growth in sales in Peru and earnings from the Los Ramones I pipeline and a section of the Sonora pipeline that were placed into service in Mexico.", "In the first quarter of 2014, our Renewables business included $16 million of earnings from the sale of a 50% equity interest in the Copper Mountain Solar 3 project.", "Now, before we go to questions, I would like to take a moment to revisit the preferred structure for a possible TRV that we discussed at our Analyst Conference. A couple of questions were raised after the conference and I want to ensure there is clarity regarding the structure we discussed. For your reference, we list these points in the appendix.", "Our preferred TRV structure would be a publicly-traded partnership with a corporate subsidiary. The partnership would directly house assets with MLP qualifying income, while the corporate subsidiary would house assets with non-MLP qualifying income and pay dividends to the partnership. Dividends are qualifying income for the partnership under the tax rules. This structure has been used by other MLPs and provides a tax shield for both the MLP qualifying and non-qualifying income due to the step-up in tax basis.", "Creating a long-term tax yield at the corporate subsidiary, would likely not require use of any renewable tax credits. And if we were to establish a TRV, Sempra's share of any partnership income, would be taxed at Sempra's marginal tax rate. The partnership could be eligible for inclusion in an MLP index and investors would receive a K-1 versus a 1099.", "In the event that we decide to proceed, we anticipate issuing a press release, that would generally disclose the assets we intend to put into the TRV, the purpose and timing of the offering, and the basic terms of the securities. As you have seen with other entities that have issued a similar press release, SEC rules would prohibit us from speaking further about the matter beyond what would be in that press release.", "Now, let's conclude with slide 10. Overall, our financial and operating results for the quarter were very strong and support our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Excluding the impact of seasonality and SoCalGas' revenues, our first quarter adjusted earnings increased significantly compared to the same period last year, driven largely by increased operating earnings at the California Utilities. Across the company, we made progress in executing on projects within our base plan and furthered efforts to capture additional development opportunities.", "With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. So quick clarifying question on the TRV, if you will. And we're probably in store for a few more after this. But at the publicly-traded level, this isn't an MLP, and it is more of a comp in the context of a YieldCo than it is an MLP, correct? And vis-\u00e0-vis the taxation \u2013 the tax benefit is more in the step-up akin to a YieldCo than it is an MLP, if I could be very clear about that.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I'm going to ask Joe to kind of walk through this to the extent we can and how we've done some modeling of how this might all work, so.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Julien. How are you doing? Thanks for the question. Actually, this is more akin to an MLP than it is to a YieldCo. So in the appendix, I've republished the slide that we had at the Analyst Conference, and on that slide 23 in the new deck, that publicly-traded partnership in the medium blue color, that is akin to an MLP. So we would be the GP and have LP units, and the public partners would be like MLP partners in a publicly-traded partnership.", "That publicly-traded partnership would hold our midstream assets, our LNG assets, other assets that would qualify under those rules. And then it would also own this corporate subsidiary and the corporate subsidiary would hold assets such as our renewable assets. And then those would be shielded by tax benefits and would produce dividends that would be qualifying for the MLP.", "So the characterization of the tax benefits will be more akin to an MLP and the public partners, each time they buy in, would get a step-up to their price.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Julien, is that clear?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes. Well, if I can follow-up just for a quick second.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "The parent here, the actually publicly-traded element, that would be more of a \u2013 it would be more of an MLP but it wouldn't benefit from the MLP tax benefits coming up from the qualifying income?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. Yes, it would. It absolutely...", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "It would. Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It will be essentially an MLP, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And is there any limitations then on the qualifying dividends from the corporate subsidiary? Just to be clear.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. Those dividends are qualifying dividends and then the MLP qualifying income, the LNG income or other midstream income is just like any other MLP.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Moving on, just in terms of California and looking at the SONGS situation, your peers to the north discussed or released several e-mails of late, et cetera, do you have any intentions or plans to file anything comparable related to the settlement process on your side or any other comment you might want to add vis-\u00e0-vis the latest development?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Julien, no. And we have not had any data requests. We've had no subpoenas, nothing of that nature that we've looked at all the documents that our fellow utilities to the north have filed and we don't see anything in those documents that concern us at all. So as far as we're concerned, that issue is not relevant to SDG&E at this time.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for being so clear.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Thanks. Looking at the first quarter numbers, if we were to just try to adjust for the seasonality issue, would it be fair to sort of, if we took the $113 million out of the quarter, assuming that you were earning it over the course of the rest of the year, and just looked at that earnings number, that would be a good \u2013 would that be a reasonable comp to last year? Because it looks, you would have been sort of $1.41 without the seasonality, which was still sort of a few pennies above the consensus. Is that a fair way to look at it or not?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's a fair way to look at it. And if you look at it, year-over-year, doing it that way and then adjusting for SONGS and LNG, which we say we take out of our adjusted earnings target, and adjusting for those in both years, certainly SONGS in both years. You end with a more than 17% year-over-year growth rate in earnings. So we feel it looks like a really strong quarter, and it was driven by outstanding performance by our two California Utilities and our international operations.", "And so we just felt \u2013 if I look at our history, in fact I had them pulled the numbers today, it was the strongest first quarter we've ever had. And one of the strongest quarters Sempra has ever had in its entire history. So we just are feeling really good about the results that came out first quarter.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Great. Follow-up question. Is there anything you can tell us with regard to commercial milestones that we can look for, and then in the coming months, the several different LNG export projects that you're working on, whether it's Costa Azul, the Greenfield at Port Arthur or the incremental two trains at Cameron.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask Mark to answer this. But, I would tell you that, Mark and I've even been at meetings with potential partners or counterparties on this. So there is a lot of activity going on and there is a lot of interest in the marketplace still. And so Mark, why don't you talk about it and especially in light of our competitive position.", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "Look. I think there is a lot of little milestones that you're going to see regulatory filings and the like that are going to be proceeding as we go forward, but I think the most important things to take away are \u2013 is that in the environment that we're operating in now, I think people lose sight of the fact that we still have an increasing demand for LNG worldwide, and we have continued interest in these facilities.", "And I think the biggest, the most important thing is, is that especially, the facilities in the Gulf, both our Cameron facility and the potential Port Arthur facility are, as we showed you at the Analyst Conference, should be the lowest cost providers of LNG around the world. And so I think there is still strong interest in that. We've met with several interested counterparties and potential customers and we're working on those. We're working on agreements to move these projects forward, and we don't have anything to announce yet, but we feel pretty good about our prospects.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would like to add to that...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thank you very much.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would just add to that. As a reminder, none of that is in our five-year base plan. So all of that would be any of the expansions at Cameron or the Port Arthur opportunities or ECA opportunities have not been factored into the base plan we showed you at the Analyst Meeting and would give us upside beyond that timeframe of the plant.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Got you. Thanks again.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Hi. Good afternoon or good morning to you, guys. Just two very quick questions. Just on the \u2013 on Greg's question just when he was going over the quarter and how that was kind of comparing to your plan and then using the $1.41 as you state. Would it be fair to say just kind of looking at what we have for the second, third and fourth quarters that you're at this point because of the stronger first quarter, again I understand it's early in the year, but trending towards the high end of your guidance range?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we never give guidance within our ranges. So I would say that clearly the first quarter was very strong and that it was driven by operating performance. So it was not driven by a lot of one-time issues. There were a few one-time things, but it was really just very strong operating performance by our businesses. So I'll let you determine where you think we would be within the range. We're keeping our range constant for now. We'll look at it at the end of second quarter. And if we decide to make adjustments, that would be kind of the timeframe when we would typically do that.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Great. Thank you. And then just again on the TRV, I don't know if this is a question you could ask, but when we kind of look at what that marginal rate could potentially be, is there any type of a range you can give on that, whether it's a 35% statutory rate or whether it could end up being different by the time you get out and get this transaction done.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Andy, I'm going to have Joe respond to that the best we can.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Andy. So let me talk to that in two ways because I think there has been some question about what that meant. And what I wrote on the slide was that our share of partnership income would be taxed at the marginal rate. And income, I don't want it to be confused with distributions, because often sometimes investors think of the distributions and they compare a tax rate to what other MLPs, existing MLPs might be paying on their distribution, so please divorce those two.", "Whatever our share of cash flow is from the business is different from what our taxable income is. Just like today, in our Renewable business, for example, we have a lots of great cash flow from those businesses, but not much taxable income, so we don't pay much tax because it's shielded by depreciation. So all of these assets will have depreciation. I can't obviously forecast it at this point because we don't have all that information out there yet. And so you'll have information at the right time if we move forward and give you a prospectus, so \u2013 but I want you to be sure that you're clear that distributions are different from income.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Andy.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. How are you doing? Just wanted to ask...", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi. We're good.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "It's only been about five weeks since the Analyst Conference, but you talked about having to work through a lot of complications with different partnerships on assets that you could potentially contribute to the TRV. So curious if you can provide an update on how that work is going, and if you're any more or less optimistic that those things can be worked through?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'm going to have Joe talk about that. I would say one of the key issues we talked about at the Analyst Conference that we are still waiting for is the IRS Private Letter Ruling. And we have had discussions with IRS, and it looks like it will be forthcoming at some time in the reasonable future. And that was one of the issues that we talked about at the conference. But I'm going to have Joe talk about how we're working through all of the other issues we presented.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks. Hi, Matt. Yeah, we laid out for you all the assets that we had, the ones we wholly-owned: the Cameron, the Renewables. And we laid out very clearly for you what we were working on. And as Debbie just mentioned, on the U.S. LNG marketing, we're awaiting for the Private Letter Ruling. We've been talking with the IRS. I would say at this point, it's a little bit of wordsmithing going on and I still feel very confident about that. We've actually finished doing our structuring around the ECO liquefaction opportunity there. And we've made really good progress with some of our counterparties on the Renewables. So we're just in the process of papering some of that stuff up. So we are actually making good progress on these things as we said we would, and we're working hard on it every day.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. And then kind of in the same vein, I think, I wanted to ask about this wind project acquisition and I know you haven't baked any more acquisitions like this into your plan. But should we expect you are continuing to look for more opportunities like this? And if so, are you seeing many attractive opportunities or is this just kind of a one-off?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We are seeing a lot of opportunities and that was the reason we tried to present this to you in the Analyst Meeting with what's in the base plan so you kind of watch us and see us as we capture some of these. And then we're trying to do our slides in a way so that you can really see when we capture some of the upside that could affect during the five-year period and then when we capture upside that could go beyond the five-year period.", "And so this is the first; a month after the conference we had one to announce. We're working on a number of other things right now that can add growth to the plan. And we talked about at the Analyst Conference, we'd already identified over $7 billion to $8 billion of opportunities that could occur during the five years of the plan that we're working. And every day we're working on those, so I think over time you will continue to see some positive announcements.", "We just had a leadership meeting and I will tell you, our team is committed to continuing to do development work and to get some projects concluded. And we have a lot of things in the pipe. I was on a pharma company board for a while and they always talked about the pipeline as being critical to the long-term success of that business. And I will tell you, we have a really, really strong pipeline.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. And just one last one on the upcoming bid in Mexico at the CFC. Looks like the timing maybe moved out a month or two on some of those, is that just kind of a typical delays you see, or is there anything else there that we should be aware of?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's a typical delay that we've seen that in pretty much all of the bids that they've come out with. And usually when they get to the point that they are now, where they've actually posted the date, then they generally hold pretty close to that. But some of the early projections that we gave when they listed all of the, almost 20 pipelines on and told us when the bids were going to come out, some of those have slipped a few months. And that's just been typical.", "Matt Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, again.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Hey. Good morning for you over there.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi. How are you?", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Hi. Not badly. I just wanted to ask a quick question. Thanks for all the detail on the TRV. That's very, very helpful. I did want to ask another question though on the Mexican bids here. Obviously it's a lot of capital here. I'm wondering how you've won some bids on your own. If you have still any interests in partnering with other larger multinationals, or how you see that kind of dynamics in the market for bids here, or whether you prefer to go it alone as with just Sempra?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Generally, we've looked at what we need to be competitive and we feel like we just have some natural competitive advantages ourselves. We always look at could a partner bring us more competitive advantages, and so we're open to that. But for us to be able to do these and we look at where we are now in Mexico and the ability that we have to increase our leverage there and to really do a lot more big projects, we haven't felt the need to partner with anyone.", "And we feel that, if you look at all the pipelines in Mexico and the percentage of them that we own and the work that we've done there, we've really felt like we do have some strong competitive advantages in getting rights of way, having the supplier base that we worked with time and time again and then having the employees that about 600 employees in Mexico that work on these things all the time. So unless we saw someone bringing something to the table that we thought can make us more competitive, we think we're really well positioned.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Thanks for that. That's all I have today.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon. Most of my questions were answered, but I wanted to ask a little bit more about this incentive award you won at SoCalGas and in particular if there is any other incentive revenues that you're eligible for and how that would work?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. That was from the gas cost incentive mechanism, which we've had in place for 30 years or something. But I'm going to have Dennis talk about at SoCalGas the incentive mechanisms we have. And there's really two categories, the energy efficiency and the gas cost incentive mechanism. And then have Jeff give you the same information for SDG&E, which is really focused on the energy efficiency incentive. Dennis?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Neel, the way that it works is, as Debbie mentioned, there are two main categories. The gas cost incentive mechanism is set up to basically encourage us to try to buy gas on behalf of our core customers as inexpensively as we can. And if we can do better than a certain benchmark, then shareholders get to reap part of the benefits there. And in the prior year, which we just recorded here in the first quarter of 2015, it was a good year, given the volatility in the gas markets, and as a result, we were able to get approved $8 million of GCIM.", "The other award that we're waiting for that that we've already applied for is energy efficiency. And ordinarily, that comes in the fourth quarter, and that's probably going to be somewhere in the $2 million range on an after-tax basis. But those are the two main incentive categories that we have at SoCalGas.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, for SDG&E, please.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.", "Thank you for the question, Neel. You'll recall that in 2014, SDG&E picked up roughly $7.5 million from energy efficiency awards. And a lot of this has to do with the timing of which calendar years get pulled through. But to Dennis' point, these are usually fourth quarter awards. And for SDG&E, in 2015, there'll be roughly \u2013 our expectation is roughly in the $3 million.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Got it. And my second question, I just wanted to clarify. Last year, the gains from some of your asset sales were included in operational earnings. This year, the Mesquite sale and the gain associated with that in Q2, that won't be part of operations. Is that correct?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct. In the first quarter of last year, we had a gain on CMS 4 of $16 million after-tax in Q1 of 2014. And in Q2, we will report a gain of roughly $34 million from Mesquite but that is not included in our guidance numbers. Yes.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I was just going to add on to that. Historically, for the last four years, five years, six years, we have included in our guidance as part of our ongoing Renewable business, gains from the renewable portfolio as we put them into partnerships, because that is part of our business. We develop these projects, and then we've had a strategy of putting them into partnerships. And so that's been kind of part of the ongoing business. Whereas the sale of the Mesquite gas-fired plant is same as what we did when we sold the first half of it and we also excluded that I think in that year. So it's a different thing. It's kind of a one-time sale versus ongoing part of our business.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just want to touch base with you on the LNG marketing. On the slide, it says there is $5 million decrease from that. And I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more what was going on there and what the outlook is.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark? Yeah.", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "This on the LNG development costs?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "No. On the LNG marketing.", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "The decline, yeah. That's almost entirely \u2013 it's entirely related to gas price declines.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And the gas price went down to $3 versus $5 a year ago.", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "Yeah.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And so going forward, how do we think about that moving around? Is it going to be sort of the same range?", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "It will \u2013 yeah, Paul, it will move around a little bit with gas prices. But if gas prices go up, then we should recover some of that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then the Sundry items, it looked like there was an increase in the quarter by about $120 million. And I was wondering what was driving that? And also if it had any EPS impact?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I'm going to turn it to Joe and Trevor to...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Paul, a large portion of that increase was greenhouse gas allowances. And there is an offset in other liabilities, things that SDG&E and SoCal collect through customers and owe it. And so it was mostly that. It wasn't the thing you were thinking about, which sometimes we have these gains in the Rabbi trust, and that drives it up. And there was a little bit of \u2013 about there, $9 million, I think.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Yeah. We've separately broken out the Rabbi trust on the line above. So we've got that above it now. So Sundry doesn't have the Rabbi trust in it. This is just solely those items associated with really fixed price contracts and other derivatives in greenhouse gas allowances and in some other items, but the biggest driver was a $91 million movement in greenhouse gas allowances.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So it wasn't an income item.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. Good afternoon. On SoCalGas just so I understand the seasonality here. Is the way to think about this is that the operating costs and D&A is going to be roughly straight-lined across the year, but that revenue and cost to goods is going to be sort of variable with the amount of gas being sold into the utility system?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'm going to have Dennis kind of walk you through this again. And I think it would be helpful if you kind of looked at what really happens with the seasonality adjustment. The important thing is that at the end of the year, everything should even out from historical years. It's just in between the periods of time and how this follows our cash flow and how it follows our balancing accounts and all of that. So I'll have Dennis kind of walk you through that to help everyone understand it a bit. Dennis?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah. Faisel, I think the two key takeaways as Debbie mentioned are: at the end of the year, there is no impact to earnings; and at the end of the year, there is no impact to cash flow. But if you look at based on your question, what's happening is we are now starting from a GAAP perspective recording the core margin revenues so that they reflect more the actual activity in our business. What's happened is, historically, if you looked at we've flatlined it 1/12 (40:09) every month across the \u2013 every month on an annual basis.", "Now we're \u2013 you can see that for the first quarter about 56% of our overall earnings are in the first quarter. And you'll see the vast majority of the earnings in the fourth quarter. What does end up happening is relative to GAAP, whatever expenses we have every quarter, will continue to be recorded in those quarters. So you're not going to see a huge change in our expenses on a quarter-to-quarter basis versus what we've had historically. But what you will see is the higher earnings in the first and fourth quarters which obviously \u2013 on the core margin which will lead to higher revenues.", "From a balancing account perspective, you will see some changes there but again, no changes to full-year earnings and no changes to cash flow.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And our expenses are recorded at actual for the quarter just to be clear.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "That's right.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We've always recorded our expenses at actual for the quarter, so those were never normalized.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "That's Right.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "What was normalized was the revenue side of it. So this changes the revenue to really reflect how we're collecting it from customers.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "And it's consistent with what we've been doing for our non-core earnings and how we've actually been recording for SDG&E all along.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Did that answer your question, Faisel? I just want to be sure because I...", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "(41:31).", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, totally. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Thanks. And then next question on SDG&E, just with the introduction of the sort of battery technology or battery products from Tesla, yeah, how does this impact sort of the SDG&E utility? I mean, do you expect this to result to sort of more people wanting to get off the grid or just to kind of a broader sort of view on how you're looking at this technology and the impact to the utility?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me have Jeff address that because we have done so much work in this area. And in fact, SDG&E is kind of the leader in terms of having the most electric vehicles and all in the country. So I think it would be helpful to have Jeff address this.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.", "Good morning, Faisel. Certainly, some of the announcements you've been seeing around batteries, and most recently in this last week, is there are interesting announcements. I think the key thing that I always like people to remember is that, a little bit over a year ago the state approved a procurement process for the California Utilities where we would procure just over 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage. You have to recall that's all targeted for grid level storage. That's in between the point of central station production through the transmission grid down to the substation in your respective service territories. That opportunity for SDG&E is about 165 megawatts.", "And when you think about energy storage, we think it will follow a similar path to other technologies like solar. So you think about all of the purchases of solar in Europe at the central station level, as manufacturing capacity expanded around the world, you saw more of that start making a migration toward the residential side. So I think you'll see central applications will be the first mover for batteries.", "But with respect to the residential, obviously there is a lot of hype around this, but I mean our perspective is a little bit different and it's because of the rate mechanism and how billing occurs in California. So if you are a rooftop solar customer in SDG&E's territory, as you produce electricity, it goes to offset your bundled rate in the month that it occurs. And if you have excess production in that month, it rolls forward to the next month.", "So in essence, the way the rate mechanism worked in California, you're getting free battery service every month. You're not paying for it, right? So at all times, whatever you produce is offsetting the bundled rate. And that's really the goal of any type of residential application, is to ensure that you can always use it for your bundled service rather than selling it back, at some type of marginal costs.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.", "So we think it's an exciting area. We think you'll see more on the residential side. But right now, the PUC's goal is to get to 1.3 gigawatts online by 2024. That gives you some timeline about how people are thinking about the central station side of it.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Understood. And then just on the Renewable side, the \u2013 I think I missed this, the Black Oak Getty wind project. How much did you guys pay for that asset?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't generally talk about how much we pay for assets but it was de minimis, because it's an early development project. We will have about, when it's fully built, approximately $145 million, $150 million of capital in it when it's fully built. But it's just in the early stage development. So we will be doing all the build-out and all.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And last question from me. Do you guys have any outlook on the storage environment, gas storage environment? Are you seeing any sort of recovery in the business? Are we still looking at sort of $0.02 a month in sort of storage pricing?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll have Mark talk about that because there are some things that are looking up in that area. And so Mark, do you want to -?", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "Yeah. I would say that it's \u2013 I think we're seeing things that are slightly better than what you're talking about on a spot basis, and then on a term basis we're seeing much better rates. So that's all pretty positive. It's still a very low-priced environment for storage compared to what it was a few years ago, but I would say it's definitely kind of improving, albeit that it's been slow and a little bit sporadic. But it does definitely seem to be on an uptrend.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Dandurand with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and thanks for the question. Most of them have actually been answered, but one, I just wanted to follow-up on the gas storage actually and more related to LNG opportunities. So Mark, if you could just touch on what you're thinking about there as kind of the ramp-up in LNG facilities coming online in the Gulf Coast.", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "That's a great question. Obviously, we believe and others now are starting to see the opportunity for storage in the Gulf, but that is directly tied to LNG facilities. And the difference between this type of storage and say others would be that these storage facilities that will service these facilities will have a lot more compression so that their injection rates are a lot higher than a typical storage facility. And we are currently working with a couple customers right now on our Louisiana storage facility, and we hope to be able to talk about that more in the near-term. But it looks exciting; it looks like we may have something there to talk about later.", "Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Great. So that near-term being within the next year or something like that?", "Mark Alan Snell - President", "Before year-end. Yeah, sometime in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Dandurand - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. That's all I have. Congrats, again.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Just to clarify on the tax rate on the TRV, so we still don't know exactly what the tax rate would be on distributions to Sempra. But in theory, it should be less than the marginal tax rate because it's got some kind of shield depreciation \u2013 shield?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, sir.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So the short answer is, yes.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. And then secondly, Debbie, you mentioned after at some point soon, you'll commence settlement discussions in your rate case. Does that \u2013 any indication of just you may be feeling better about, chances of settling this case and maybe the last one or is it just more normal process?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think a couple of things, as we've talked before, our filings were pretty vanilla. And they really focused on safety issues and reliability issues and dollars needed for that at our utilities. And it wasn't about a lot of new programs or activities. So I think and then looking at the ORA report that came out, the issues that they raised on their report are issues \u2013 I've been here 37 years now, I've seen those issues for 37 years.", "So it's like nothing unusual in their report and so I think that that is a fertile ground for settlement when you have that type of \u2013 at least you're not talking about being having a lack of common interest. Clearly, the parties are interested in safety and investing in safety as a system.", "So we're hopeful that we could try to reach some settlement with some of the parties. We have not yet seen the other intervener testimony. That will be coming in sometime the middle of May.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting Limited (49:35).", "Unknown Speaker", "Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Other than the $113 million of seasonality adjustment, were there any other income items that relates to different periods, but were recorded in the first quarter of this year?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the $113 million is the seasonality. I wasn't clear if you said $113 million, but it's $113 million. And then the SONGS issue, which we took out in adjusted earnings, was really kind of a reconciliation of all of the settlement that was reached on SONGS and what the tax treatments and all ended up being on that. So that when we took out it in our adjusted earnings that we gave you. And I would ask Trevor or Joe if there is anything else that they would see in there.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Yeah. The only other thing would be the item that Dennis had mentioned, was the GCIM, which was related to the prior year, but awarded in the current year.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And that's a...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's a rolling...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Yeah.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And that's a rolling thing.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "We ordinarily get a GCIM award. Last year, we got it in the third quarter, and this year, we got in the first. But it's...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Right.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So we get it every year.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Yeah.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So it's not a...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's not a one-time.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's not a prior period.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I did want to be clear on the $113 million. That is all this year's revenue. It has nothing to do with any other year. It just all happens to be coming in the first quarters and fourth quarters, for the most part.", "Unknown Speaker", "Yeah. Thanks. I understand. I have one other little question. What was for the quarter the foreign exchange impact given the strength of the U.S. dollar in that quarter versus foreign currencies?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Thanks. Almost nothing. We had some impact in Chile and Peru, but it was essentially just reducing the growth in the earnings in the two businesses. And maybe it was around $4 million, but it was completely offset by FX gains in Mexico, about $5 million. So the net impact of the whole business is negligible.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium (51:46).", "Unknown Speaker", "My questions have been answered. Debbie, just on what you said that you expect the PLR in a reasonable period, I'm expecting it's \u2013 that would imply sometime during the summer.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry. I couldn't hear your question.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The PLR. Would we get it in the summer?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's \u2013 I'm sorry, the?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The Private Letter Ruling.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. The Private Letter Ruling. Yeah. It's all \u2013 can I tell you when IRS is going to do, something that's really hard. I would tell you that what I hear from our people is that there doesn't seem to be issues, and that it's not a matter that there is a problem. It's just the matter of them getting their work done and issuing the ruling, and so that's the best I can tell you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. We think it's in final stages.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go to our final question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Hi. Just a quick follow-up. So just once you get the PLR and you get the other housekeeping issues done, whether it's with your JV partners or whatever else may it be, at that point, whenever that may be, that, I guess, sort of we'll hear from you. It doesn't need to be on a quarterly basis, I guess. It's kind of when you're ready to go...", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me just...", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "...we'll hear from you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I mean, we will have to make a decision about moving forward when all of this work is done. And then when our board makes a decision as to whether we move forward, then the next step would be filing a press release. And then after the press release, there would be a period of time and then the S-1 filing would be made. And so that's what I think you can look for. It doesn't have to be an announcement on a quarter. It just needs to be when our board has made a decision as to whether or not we would move forward.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions in our queue, so I'll turn the call back over to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you all for joining us today. Actually, you had a lot of great questions.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.", "Richard Vaccari", "Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2015 financial presentation. A live webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With us today are several members of our management team: Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; Steve Davis, President of SDG&E; and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Mark.", "Mark Snell", "Thanks, Rick. To start off, I want to mention that Debbie is not joining us today. She had a medical issue with her left eye that required attention and treatment this morning. She apologizes for not being able to make the call, but we all realized health issues come first. I'll be filling in for her today. And so now, we'll get on with the call.", "Our financial performance for the second quarter was very strong. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $260 million or $1.03 per share. As you may recall, these figures include the impact from applying seasonality to the SoCalGas revenues in 2015. While this change does not affect full-year earnings for SoCalGas that results in almost all of their earnings being reported in the first quarter and fourth quarter of the year. Specifically, the impact from seasonality was $48 million of lower earnings this quarter, and $65 million of higher earnings year-to-date. Given our solid financial results in both the first quarter and second quarter, we are on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earning guidance.", "Today, I'd also like to emphasize that just six months into the first year of our current five-year plan, we have already secured by new projects that are additional to the base plan we presented at the March Analyst Conference. At U.S. gas and power, we have added two new solar projects at our Mesquite facility in Arizona, this adds to the Black Oak Getty wind project we announced last quarter. In Mexico, IEnova was awarded another CFE pipeline project in July. And last week, IEnova agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in IEnova-PEMEX joint venture.", "In addition, we're working on the steps needed to advance our potential LNG projects, which could extend growth beyond 2019. And our California utilities have made headway on the GRC and rate reform initiatives.", "We are all really pleased, with our progress, and will discuss our development projects in more detail as we proceed. First, let me begin with a regulatory and operational update, including a discussion of our progress in achieving our base plan. Please turn to slide five.", "Our California utilities are making steady progress on their general rate case applications. Since our last call, we have completed evidentiary hearings, and are well situated to receive a timely decision. Briefs are due in August and September with the draft decision scheduled for year end. After participating in the hearing process, we believe our recommendations make a compelling case in support of the state\u2019s priorities around safety and reliability. Please turn to slide six.", "Turning to one of FDG&Es highest priorities, the CPUC approved a final decision on rate reform in July. The decision implements electric rates that are more fair and sustainable. We provide a summary in the appendix, but key outcomes of the decision include, a reduction in the number of tiers, from four down to two, and annual reduction and rate differentials between the lowest and highest tiers, minimum monthly bills and a process to study and implement time of use rates.", "The decision directs all the state\u2019s electric utilities to implement initial changes, no later than November 1, 2015. Yesterday, net energy metering tariff proposals were also filed by all parties. Once approved the tariffs will determine how customers with new distributed energy resources will pay for utility services they received. FDG&E's suggested tariffs would apply to all new net energy metering customers by 2017. Though we expect a final decision by year-end, it could extend into the next year.", "Let's now go to slide seven for an update on base plant projects and our other businesses. We're really executing well on our five-year plan. Since our last earnings call, two more projects are in service. In Mexico, the 155 megawatt ESJ wind project reached commercial operations in June and in the U.S. 1.2 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity on the REX pipeline, was placed into service over this last weekend.", "In addition, we closed the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite power plant in the second quarter. We received $347 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $36 million after tax gain on the sale. As discussed last quarter, this gain is not included in our 2015 adjusted earning guidance.", "Please turn to slide eight for update on our development opportunities. We're pleased to announce that we have secured several development opportunities this quarter that are additional to our base plan. In Mexico, IEnova was awarded a new CFE pipeline project in July. The project represents an investment of about $110 million and is expected to be in operations in the first half of 2017.", "CFE has announced two more pipelines will be awarded in August and September, one of which interconnects with the pipeline we just won. Five more pipelines are scheduled to be awarded later this year. You can refer to the table in the appendix for details.", "In addition, on Friday, we announced the IEnova has agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in their shared joint venture. The transaction is expected to close later this year. As noted in our recent press release, IEnova agreed to purchase the business for approximately $1.3 billion subject to certain terms and conditions.", "IEnova and PEMEX will also maintain a 50/50 JV for the continued joint development of the Los Ramones Norte pipeline and other future infrastructure projects. As a result of the transaction, IEnova will own 100% of six purchased assets, five of which are currently in operation. The assets are covered by long-term dollar-based contracts. The acquisition is expected to be about $0.05 accretive to Sempra Energy's earnings in 2016 growing to about $0.10 per share by 2019. IEnova expects to finance the purchase with a combination of equity and debt.", "The acquisition provides several important benefits and ongoing relationship with PEMEX for future development projects, opportunities for asset optimization and expansion into areas such as the transportation and storage of refined products, and a larger platform of presence in Mexico to participate in the energy sector reform.", "Moving to U.S. Gas & Power. We are pleased to announce contracts on two new renewable projects that are Mesquite Solar facility in Arizona. Mesquite Solar 2 will be a 100-megawatt project secured by a 20-year PPA. Mesquite Solar 3 will be a 150-megawatt project secured by a 25-year PPA, both PPAs are with creditworthy counterparties and we expect the projects to be in service by the end of 2016. And finally, I will note that we are working diligently to prepare our S-1 filing for Sempra Partners. Securities laws, however, prohibit us from discussing the matter further.", "Let's now go to slide nine for a discussion of our LNG development process. LNG development continues to be a terrific long-term growth opportunity with very large potential for upside for Sempra. While the development process takes time and can vary between projects, we are making solid progress on all three of our liquefaction initiatives.", "Since LNG development continues to be a hot topic for investors, we provided this slide to illustrate the process needed to advance the project to FID or final investment decision. Cameron Expansion is the project that is furthest along, so we use that project as an example.", "But before walking you through the slide, I want to reiterate a couple of key themes. First, while projections for global LNG demand are lower than a few years ago, industry forecast continue to show large un-contracted demand post 2019. These forecasts already include competing sources of supply such as the restart of some of Japan's nuclear fleet, more coal and renewable development in Asia, growing pipeline imports into customer markets and indigenous shale gas sales.", "Second, U.S. Gulf LNG projects are regarded as the most competitive source of global supply, both in cost and in flexibility. And third, we are receiving strong interest in our projects from large buyers of LNG for delivery in the 2019 and beyond timeframes.", "Now moving to the graphic on this slide, we have illustrated key work streams related to project cost and design permitting, marketing and financing. You'll notice that each category is interrelated. EPC project cost estimates and lenders' consents are needed in order to finalize customer contracts, agreements with customers on tariffs and service dates and quantities are needed to finalize financing commitments. In financing terms, the regulatory approvals are needed to make the final investment decision. Completion of each of these work streams is what enables us to take a project to achieve FID. For Cameron expansion, we're targeting FID in late 2016. Our Cameron joint venture is currently permitting trains four and five, but the project could begin with one or two trains depending on total market interest.", "Cameron expansion is well positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of global LNG supply. This is due to the economies of scale and adding more trains to an existing facility, the opportunity to benefit from continuous construction at the site, a simpler permitting process, an access to low-cost of capital and of course in expense of North American Gas.", "Moving to other LNG development projects, we continue to actively develop the Port Arthur project and have submitted the initial filings at both DOE and FERC. Market interest in this project remains strong as it offers different off take and ownership opportunities from those available at Cameron. In June, we also announced an MOU with Woodside Petroleum to work on the feasibility of developing the project together.", "For ECA we are working with the Mexican government in the development of all the regulations and conditions needed to support liquefaction and export of LNG from Mexico. We have completed a large - we have completed a number of studies on technical feasibility and market interest for this sole west coast Brownfield site. Together with PEMEX, we continue to advance the development work and are now sharing costs.", "Now with that let's turn to slide 10, for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe?", "Joe Householder", "Thank you, Mark. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $295 million or $1.17 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported second quarter earnings of $260 million or $1.03 per share. Second quarter earnings in 2014 were $269 million or $1.08 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude two items first we recorded a $36 million after-tax gain on the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite Power Plant. Second as I noted last quarter, we are adjusting earnings for expenses relating to the development of our pre-proposed LNG liquefaction projects. While our cash expenditures have been consistent with cost for the LNG development activities, we've undertaken thus far we have recorded $1 million of after-tax expense in the second quarter of 2015. This number reflects the fact that certain costs are being capitalized and certain other costs are being shared with our Cameron joint venture partners and PEMEX.", "I also wanted to note that compared with the same period of last year, second quarter earnings now reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas revenues. As Mark mentioned earlier, this impact resulted in $48 million of lower earnings this quarter and $65 million of higher earnings year-to-date.", "Looking to the third quarter please be aware that we could report a loss for SoCalGas due to seasonality. You can refer to the appendix for additional detail where we illustrate 2014 SoCalGas earnings at seasonality and revenues been applied. As the appendix shows third quarter 2014 earnings would have reflected a loss in the third quarter. So there was no impact on a full year basis.", "Overall, we are on track to achieving our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance given the strong financial performance we've had year-to-date. Finally, before proceeding, I want to mention that we expect to report a one-time non-cash gain next quarter, we will step up our investment to fair value related to IEnova's purchase of PEMEX's interest in their joint venture. The size of the gain has not yet been determined and is not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance.", "Please turn to slide 11. Individual financial results for each of our businesses could be found in this section of our presentation entitled business unit earnings. I'll address here the key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter. Sempra International recorded $19 million of higher earnings primarily from the Los Ramones I pipeline and a section of the Sonora pipeline in Mexico that are now in service.", "SoCalGas recorded a $13 million retroactive benefit for 2012 to the first quarter of 2015 from higher rate base. Approval of this benefit by the PUC was contingent upon receiving a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS which we received in April. SoCalGas also had $10 million of higher operational earnings from higher CPUC margins net of operating expenses and higher AFUDC equity earnings. Offsetting these positive factors were two items, the $48 million seasonality impact that lowered SoCalGas's 2015 earnings and $11 million of lower net investment earnings at the parent on assets in support of our retirement obligations.", "Now let's conclude with slide 12. Overall, our financial and operating results for the second quarter continued to be very strong and consistent with our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Excluding the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas's revenues, our second quarter adjusted earnings increased significantly compared to the same period last year driven largely by increased operating results at both Sempra International and SoCalGas. Across the company, we have made excellent progress on our base plan and continue to capture additional development opportunities. As we look forward to the remainder of the year we are working diligently to capture more development opportunities that can provide upside to our base plan in the near term.", "In addition, we'll continue to work toward advancing our LNG projects that could extend this growth beyond 2019.", "With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Joe Householder", "Hi, Mike.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "It's Julien here.", "Joe Householder", "Hey Julien, how are you?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Hey, not too bad. Thank you. I suppose first question here out of the gates, obviously the IEnova is a pleasant development but curious, you're providing a bridge loan but ultimately how are you thinking about your ownership stake in IEnova pro forma for the latest deal, but probably more strategically, how are you thinking about that down the line as you think about the 80%-ish you're on today?", "Mark Snell", "Well, I'm going to let Joe handle that question in detail, but let me just say off the bat that we are expecting to finance this at the IEnova level and even if we don't participate in this thing and I'll let Joe explain what we're thinking there but even if we didn't, it would still be accretive to us but Joe why don't you give some more details on that.", "Joe Householder", "Yeah. Thanks, Mark and hi Julien. Yeah, this is very important and we're studying the issue. We really like this deal and so we would like to participate in the deal. We are looking at, what the market is going to be like over the next couple of months. We've got a lot of confidence from the banks we've worked with on this transaction. And I think our current view is, we will participate in the equity offering. We know that a number of our IEnova investors want to have more liquidity. So, we've said all along that if we have a large project this would enable us to go back out to the equity markets. And so we're going to have an equity offering I believe, we will participate. What I'm currently thinking is, we have a dividend coming later this week from IEnova. It will come to our Mexican Holding company. And I think, we'll use that cash plus some other cash to participate in the offering. We haven't decided the firm amount yet, we want to see how the shares are doing and how the market is, but we definitely will participate, and as Mark said, this is going to be accretive either way.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Great. Excellent. Turning to the LNG story. Curious, you mentioned on the slides here for instance one trains or two trains at Cameron. I suppose, as it relates to the project, what's your confidence level, as it relates to one trains or two trains? And, then secondly, in terms of conversations, are you still expecting that you passively acknowledge to the Street one way or another perhaps by 4Q or 1Q next year a decision. I mean, I know, you indicate FID by second half of 2016, but just wanted to be very clear about your communication intentions?", "Mark Snell", "Well, with respect to trains four and trains five, we have this partnership that owns a facility, we own 50% and our partners own the other 50%. Currently through trains one, trains two, trains three our partners have all of the capacity. With respect to trains four and trains five, we have a right, Sempra has the right to 50% of that capacity, we're highly confident that we're going to be able to market that capacity and we're actively doing that now. And therefore we know that at least one of the trains will go, whether our partners decide to market that extra capacity or not is entirely up to them and we don't control that, but - Oct\u00e1vio, if you would like to comment on any of that that maybe fill in.", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es", "Sure. I think Mark covered the big topics and that is that the ownership has decided to go forward with the expansion. We have 50% of that expansion capacity roughly 4 million tons, the remaining partners have 4 million tons as well. What they're doing with their capacity, it depends whether they want to put it in the market, if it fits in their portfolio or not, we are actively pursuing it, we're encouraged by all the things we are finding in our current negotiations. And so at the end of the day, I think the slide reflects that we'll go back and say, okay, Sempra is taking on the 4 million tons that we are allotted to, if our partners say no that means that probably then one just one train will be built since there was agreement by everybody, if they market their capacity then we would have the two trains. We are permitting both trains from both the FERC and DOE.", "Mark Snell", "I'd add on Mark. Just to be clear, so everybody is clear on the call. The fourth train would be owned by the joint venture, so it'd be 50-50 ownership. But Oct\u00e1vio was right, we would have the capacity.", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es", "That's right, Joe.", "Mark Snell", "Okay.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "And just to be extra clear about this, I apologize. So this would be - you would obviously still need to go and remarket your respective ownership, but I supposed at this point in time you're indicating that you intend at least move forward on train 4, is that an incremental?", "Mark Snell", "Yeah, what we would - I mean obviously we would not move forward if we haven't sold the capacity forward, but we're in the process of that marketing effort right now and we're pretty confident that we'll get that done.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Okay. Thank you. I'll let it be.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Mark Snell", "Hi, Neel.", "Neel Mitra", "A question on the PEMEX acquisition. Now that you have a larger stake in Mexico, especially with the pipes, are you seeing additional synergies or lateral opportunities from owning a larger stake in Mexico?", "Mark Snell", "Yes, I mean, in fact we're seeing two things. One, on the cost side, with us acquiring a 100% of the pipes that we're in the JV. We believe we can integrate those with the other pipes that we own and we'll definitely get some synergies out of that that would be in addition to the earnings accretion that we've so far forecasted. So we think if there is additional upside just in the operational synergies that we can achieve. But then secondly, all of the pipeline infrastructure that we're building now, we've to this point, only marketed it to the original customer that ask for it to be built mainly CFE or PEMEX. But these are open access pipes and we are announced - into market extra capacity to other users and we've just actually started working on that and we're seeing some success and getting that. So we do think there is additional upside to come from marketing additional capacity either that exist currently or that we can create through compression and we are pretty excited about that. We think that there is a growth opportunity there.", "Neel Mitra", "And what would be the timeline for recognizing some of the possible lateral projects? When can we first hear about it?", "Joe Householder", "Well, I guess, you'll first hear about it when they are announced, but for the most part, I think we're working on some of these right now and some will be probably completed before year-end.", "Neel Mitra", "Okay. Great. And Joe you had two good quarters. Can you say where you are within the guidance range at this point? Are you at the high end or are you in the middle? Can you comment on that?", "Joe Householder", "We are not going to narrow the range or talk about where we are in the guidance. You can see the year-to-date results are really strong, you can't double those because SoCalGas is $65 million ahead on the seasonality. So that will come back and then we have a few items that are in the earnings year-to-date that won't repeat. So we feel really good about where we are, but we're not going to narrow it at this point.", "Neel Mitra", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven Fleishman", "Yeah, hi. I've got a few questions. First, on the two new solar projects. Can you give us any sense of the earnings benefit to those?", "Mark Snell", "We are not disclosing the benefits precisely, but they're 100 megawatts and 150 megawatts projects and there are consistent returns with what we've had in the past.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And then secondly just on the MLP, which I know you can't talk about. Can you just remind when we did - when you did your base plan, my recollection is that you did not kind of assume the MLP in your financing plan.", "Mark Snell", "That's correct.", "Steven Fleishman", "At your Analyst Day.", "Mark Snell", "That's correct.", "Steven Fleishman", "Is that correct?", "Mark Snell", "That's correct.", "Joe Householder", "Yeah.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And just is there any way to give any color on kind of how to think about that strategy just given current market conditions?", "Joe Householder", "The thing is we just cannot comment on the MLP at all. I just - I apologize, but that just the way the rules are and so we really can't talk about it. We'll talk about that when we do the marketing for the MLP.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And I get that. And then finally just back that you know of the $0.05 to $0.10 of accretion on the different years, that's whether you take stock or not, are related to this deal, that range is still pretty good either way, sort of the equation.", "Mark Snell", "Yes. I'll let Joe.", "Joe Householder", "Yes. It's pretty close. I mean we've evaluated this as we've been working on this deal for a few months and actually whether we borrow money or whether we issue equity, it hardly has any impact and so the only thing that moves jut slightly is whether we participate but again it's going to be accretive either way, but I think we will - you will see us participate to some degree.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And then one question on Cameron 4 and Cameron 5. So you can control of 4 million tons of one train. You're only going to go forward with yours if you sign long-term contracts, I assume.", "Joe Householder", "Correct.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. The partners have this other 4 million tons, can you - is there any way that if you kind of see the market that you could kind of take that over as well if you wanted to or is it really in their hands what to do with that?", "Joe Householder", "It's really in their hands. I mean I suppose something could be worked out but we have other projects too that we're developing and are part of our portfolio. So we have to evaluate it in relation to those just as they will.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. But it sounds like your conviction on moving forward what you control seems quite high.", "Joe Householder", "I think you could say that it is very high, yes.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. Thank you. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon", "Hey, guys. Steve just asked my question, so I'm good. Thanks.", "Mark Snell", "Okay. Thanks, Greg.", "Joe Householder", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Michael Dandurand with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Dandurand", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "Mark Snell", "Hi, Michael.", "Joe Householder", "Hi.", "Michael Dandurand", "Just to - and first of all thank -appreciate the additional color on LNG, and with particular to Cameron. I just have a follow-up there as it relates to the Port Arthur. Can you just talk a little bit about what we should be looking forward there and how things are going with Woodside now involved?", "Mark Snell", "Well, I'll start and then I'll let Oct\u00e1vio comment on this as well, but we have an MOU with Woodside to look at the feasibility of the project. We're progressing on it. We've had lots of meetings. We're starting some of the technical analysis and starting some of the marketing of the trains. It's an excellent site. It looks like it's very promising as moving forward and I would say their commitment to it is very strong. And Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to give any other color on that?", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es", "I think you've covered the process. I would just add part of the attractiveness of Port Arthur is that it appeals to customers that may want to have equity as part of their supply strategy. It allows us and Woodside to look at options to really make Port Arthur a very low cost supplier in the LNG market, which for us is key for the success of any project out of the U.S. exports of LNG. So it's - plus this is going extremely well. There is a lot of similar objectives between us Woodside, and you're likely to see some announcements as that relationship grows and as the project continues to go forward.", "Joe Householder", "Yeah. And I would just add to that. I think it's important just to keep in mind that our projects, both in the Gulf and ECO as well, we are positioning them as at the very low end of the cost curve for LNG worldwide. And so we think they will be very competitive, but that doesn't - we have other Gulf Coast facilities that obviously compete with that. But in general, our facilities and the others in the Gulf region in particular, are some of the lowest cost providers of LNG that out there. And therefore they're very likely to get lifted over time.", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es", "Mike, if I may just add. One of the key elements for any buyer of LNG in the world is the reliability and the creditability of the developer. And so, we think Sempra is very well positioned with our track record, clearly Woodside is very well positioned given their track record. And so that in itself is an advantage because we'll be offering technology that's conventional that the buyers are used, that's reliable and with all kinds of the guarantees that they expect from a project of this size.", "Michael Dandurand", "Got it. It's very helpful. So, in less of an emphasis on the spot market, if I'm hearing that correctly?", "Mark Snell", "Yes.", "Michael Dandurand", "Got it. And then just as far as, we've seen a bit of a deterioration in the midstream arena, and I appreciate that you can't discuss the MLP directly. But just as far as the broader landscape for midstream assets out there. Are you seeing anything more attractive just from an M&A standpoint.", "Mark Snell", "Well, obviously we do see some attractive M&A opportunities. We just executed on one last week. So we think that - we think that we did a very good deal last weekend and we're really happy with it. So obviously with the way the landscape has been, it could be that M&A opportunities become more viable. But it's still - there still a pretty good cost advantage to developing your own projects as opposed to train to buy them in the marketplace. We see that both - we see that both in the midstream area and also in the renewables area as well, to the extent that we continue to develop our own backlog of projects, that's a much more profitable avenue for us and we're fortunate to have a pretty good backlog of projects to work on. So I think we're very well positioned for growth and growth at the lower end of the cost curve as opposed to somebody that's trying to it through acquisition.", "Michael Dandurand", "Got it. Very helpful. I mean the only other one I have is just on Mexico with the recent project win there. Does that help your upcoming bid with the project in August here, I'm going to put you this name, the Samalayuca.", "Joe Householder", "Yeah, it does. We believe the project that we just won is kind of a large header system, which will benefit us and being able to control the costs on the next project bid that's coming up. And so I don't want to go into all the details of why that is. But we do think it gives us a little bit of an advantage and we're hoping to see some success there.", "Michael Dandurand", "Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.", "Joe Householder", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Matt Tucker", "Hey, guys. Congrats on nice quarter and on the IEnova transaction. I just wanted to ask about that. PEMEX and IEnova highlighted the remaining JV as a platform for future product development. Just talk about little bit the opportunities you see going forward with PEMEX. And also is this model - something you could see PEMEX wanting to repeat i.e. develop and construct their project in a JV and then sell their interest?", "Mark Snell", "Yeah, look, I think it's a healthy development for us in the sense that PEMEX is recognizing this transaction. They repeatedly refer to it as a monetization as opposed to a sale, because they see this opportunity to build these projects that they need to have done and then once they're built, they can monetize them through a sale to us and then start on the next project and we see that or obviously we think that that's a very exciting opportunity for us. And we were very happy that they wanted to stay into this partnership arrangement with the pipeline that's currently under construction and then the considered new projects in that.", "So I think we do think - we are looking at this as a source of future projects. We think it's a good model for us, it's worked well in the past. And I think the thing that that PEMEX appreciates is that they have now worked with us on these projects over the years. They've had good results, we've built good projects, they've come in pretty much on time and on budget and I think they see us as a really good partner that they can count on to deliver for them. And so that's something that we - obviously we pride ourselves on and we think that is going to lead to more projects in the future.", "Joe Householder", "Mark, I'd add on to that. And, Matt, I think you guys don't always see this, but Mark and I sit on the IEnova board and so we were just down there last week and we were with Debbie and we met with PEMEX and other government agencies. And it's really important, we have a very interactive ongoing relationship with IEnova. And I just want to make sure you guys all understand that.", "Matt Tucker", "Okay, great. And just on the California facilities, the GRCs mentioned they're going well. Can you just update us on any kind of key or contentious issues that are emerging as the process goes on. And I believe at the Analyst Day when you came out your longer term guidance, you had assumed no rate increase resulting from the GRCs, any update on how you're thinking about that assumption?", "Joe Householder", "Yeah, I'm going to turn this over to Dennis to give you the details. So let me just make one quick point which is - at the analyst conference and in the plan, what we assumed with respect to the GRC was just normal attrition, but I think that was just a conservative assumption to - for the planning purposes, but I think Dennis can give you some more detail on that.", "Dennis Arriola", "Thanks, Mark. Hi, Matt. Yeah, as Mark said in his opening comments. Things are going well. We finished our evidentiary hearings two days ahead of schedule and we're happy with the overall pace of the filings. Our witnesses from both SoCalGas and SDG&E did a great job of explaining the overall merits and details of both of our filings. And we're really optimistic that we're going to receive constructive decisions for both companies.", "We can't obviously disclose anything related to any settlement discussions if we're in them. But what we can tell you, is given the strong show in that we had in our evidentiary hearings and the fact that, our filings are consistent with the priorities of the PUC which are around safety, reliability and customer service. We feel really good about potential constructive discussions with intervening parties. As it pertains to the plan that Mark talked about, you're right, what we just assumed was that, our existing attrition rates of 2.75% for both SoCalGas and SDG&E, would continue from a planning perspective but obviously we've asked for more that supports our filings. And, so far, the ORA in their reply have come back and said that, they would be looking for 3.5% attrition increases in 2017 and 2018 or both SoCalGas and SDG&E. So, having said all that, we feel really good about where we're at this point.", "Matt Tucker", "Great.", "Mark Snell", "Steven, do you have any comment on that?", "Steve Davis", "No, I really have nothing more to add. But, again as Dennis pointed out, we concluded our regulatory hearings and we feel very confident in the outcome of those hearings and we look forward to construct a dialogue with parties going forward.", "Matt Tucker", "All right. Thanks. And, then just one on the LNG side, I thought it was great that you can have the visibility to target the FID on the Cameron expansion. Any sense you can gives us for - do you have targets yet for FIDs on ECA or Port Arthur or can you give us a sense for maybe how far behind they are right now?", "Mark Snell", "I'll let [ph] Trevor address that.", "Trevor Mihalik", "Sure. Port Arthur we're probably looking at something in the late 2017, late 2018 timeframe for FID. It does take - it does require a different permitting process, it's environmental impact same as opposed to environmental assessment which takes longer. And obviously we don't have the benefit or the luxury of just a continuation of the existing EPC contract and contractor at Cameron. So that will process with a limitation to bid and what not, will take longer. So late 2017, 2018 timeframe is what we're thinking about Port Arthur. For Costa Azul as we're putting all the key elements in place from regulatory standpoint and from a commercial standpoint that might be a little later than that or at the same timeframe frankly on that one, I'm not confident enough at this point to make a prognostic as to the FID timeframe.", "One of the things with respect to ECA is a lot of the regulations are still being developed. So we're not really sure exactly how to go about that process. I mean we've been working with the Mexican government on developing the regulations for LNG exports. So we're still - so to give you a firm date would be really quite difficult, but it is probably more in the Port Arthur timeframe than it is in the trains four and five timeframe.", "Matt Tucker", "Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks again.", "Trevor Mihalik", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Mark Snell", "Hey, Faisel.", "Faisel Khan", "Hey, good afternoon. Just on the PEMEX, the accretion you guys discussed in your slide from $0.05 to $0.10. So, I guess all I've got so far in that JV is in terms of projects that you're working on are expanding with a JV is the ethane pipeline. So what else is going to sort of drive that joint venture from $0.05 to $0.10? I'm assuming loss from [indiscernible]. That's still in the JV and the same ownership presenters so that doesn't change anything that's going on there.", "Well, I will let Joe address the EPS numbers.", "Joe Householder", "Hey, Faisel. So, most of it is the ethane project coming online but then in addition to that Mark talked a little bit about some of the synergies that we see and in an addition all the cash flow from the business would be accumulating and paying down debt or being available to provide some earnings and that's what's really driving the few cents additional as we go through the time period, but the bulk of it is ethane.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay. That's a pretty big uptick in earnings just from the ethane project. What's the stats of these lines in the JV, are they running at full capacity or are they - is there a room to grow that having to spend much capital?", "Joe Householder", "Yeah, actually as I mentioned earlier there's two things that we really didn't put into the EPS guidance, one was the efficiencies that we think we can get from running a whole system together, that's one. And then the two, there is either additional capacity in the lines or capacity that could be added relatively and expensively with compression and we're in the process of marketing some of that capacity to other users. So, other LDCs, power plants and those kinds of things and so we do think that there is upside there. We haven't put that - we haven't calculated that into our EPS estimates of accretion, but there is certainly other things that we think we can get.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay, got it. Makes sense. And then just on Port Arthur so the sort of relationship here are talking about with the Woodside Petroleum. So, I guess what's the timeline in terms of when you guys decide whether you're going to go forward with the joint venture and I guess therefore market the asset together or what are you guys thinking about it right now. What is the...", "Joe Householder", "Well, we're actually starting - we are marketing the asset right now, but I'll let Trevor give a little more detail.", "Trevor Mihalik", "Yeah. Let me be clear, on the marketing side of the asset clearly, we would not have engaged and pursued if we didn't find the interest so it's expert oriented. As we look through what the project now will be structured, then if it is with [indiscernible] side which obviously we hope and are confident it will be, then we together will have to develop the marketing strategy for the asset. So, that's on the marketing side. As far as, what we expect to see going forward, it's really going to be a continuation of the same process. We're looking at the feasibility. We're looking at the economics. There are hurdles that we will have to go through to make sure we go to the next stage. Are we confident we can put together a project that's low cost as it has to be? Are we confident that we can do all of the regulatory permits in all of the local issues we have to deal with?", "So, those things will be a hurdle that, we will be overcoming. We're confident we can, but it's tough to give you a timeframe at this point it's very specific. I think, you will see some developments between now and at the end of the year, but I wouldn't want to commit at this point as to what those developments are.", "Mark Snell", "And, finally you may have missed it on the question before, but we did discuss that we're talking about FID with that project with Port Arthur sort of late 2017 all the way into late 2018 sort of that time - probably in the 2018 timeframe.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay, understood. Then just on the Cameron expansion just in terms of lowering the cost of the - or providing a sort of lower cost and expansion from the economies of scale. Where do you guys think, that is right now? Especially since you've seen steel cost come down and we've seen, I mean, what - like on a percentage basis like versus what you guys have outlined for this one versus what you're thinking about the expansion, is there any color you can provide on that? Thanks.", "Mark Snell", "Well, there is a color I could but won't. Look right now, we think we have a very competitive project. We think our costs are some of the lowest in the region. We're marketing that to our advantage and I really don't want to give any more details in that.", "Faisel Khan", "Okay. Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial Research.", "Mark Barnett", "Hey, good morning/good afternoon, everyone.", "Mark Snell", "Hey, Mark.", "Mark Barnett", "Hey, you've talked a lot about the PEMEX assets and the PEMEX deal, and some of your pipeline projects and upside today. I'm just wondering given what's taken place over the past few months, six months and what not, how are you looking at the attractiveness of the generation sector in Mexico.", "Mark Snell", "Well, the generation clearly has been under stress in the U.S. Prices have been relatively low, but in Mexico there are going to be generation opportunities. On the renewable side, I think they will be quite good, they'll be - and obviously we're well positioned to do that and ESJ can be expanded pretty easily. But on the gas power generation side, and especially with respect to combined cycle plants, there will be opportunities to build those under contracts with CFE, but they haven't really been let that out that much in any kind of volume of [indiscernible] one and what we're - we're going to have to kind of wait and see - to see how that market develops. I think what they're doing in Mexico is actually really pretty smart, which is they're building out the gas network first. They're developing a very active gas market one that both CFE and the private sector will participate in to a great degree, and once if that, they have a robust gas market and a good supply network, then I think you'll start to see them let out the opportunities to build more power plants. But I think they definitely are staging at a little bit, and I think rightly so.", "Mark Barnett", "Yeah, it's definitely been a slow process. I just wonder given that you're positioned already to be a fairly large operator of the gas infrastructure, does that give you some kind of a look into where you are competitive position would be, when those kind of biz do you start to show up?", "Mark Snell", "Absolutely, I mean I think we are going to be very well positioned to take advantage of those, and I think - we have every intention of doing that. It's just that they have to meet our criteria for having long-term contracts and being solid investments which we expect them to be. But given our infrastructure and our knowledge of the gas pipeline network in Mexico, I think that we will be well positioned to take advantage of those offerings.", "Mark Barnett", "All right. Thanks.", "Mark Snell", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Mark Snell for closing remarks.", "Mark Snell", "Well, thanks again for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team, and have a great day.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's conference call.

Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2015 financial presentation. A webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "Here in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of Southern California Gas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 3, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rick. During the third quarter, our solid operating and financial performance across the company continued. With strong year-to-date results, we are now raising our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range to $4.95 per share to $5.15 per share.", "In addition, we continue to execute on our five-year base plan and are on track to meet or exceed our approximate 11% adjusted base plan EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2019. Since providing those projections at our March Analyst Conference, we have announced more than $2 billion of investment opportunities that are incremental to our base plan. We have also filed for commission approval of our GRC settlement agreement for SDG&E and SoCalGas. I am very pleased with our progress this year and I'm optimistic as we move into 2016.", "Let's begin with an operational update and then Joe will provide more detail on our financial results.", "Please turn to slide 5. With regard to our base plan, I would like to first revisit the visibility of our 11% adjusted EPS CAGR. On this slide, we provide key base plan assumption. I will mention just a few points. First, the almost $20 billion of investments included in our five-year base plan reflect projects that were essentially approved, contracted, or under construction as of March 2015. For earnings associated with these projects, we have risk mitigation strategies in place that limit our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or commodity prices. We provide additional information in the appendix to this presentation.", "Second, our base plan projections do not include impacts from the proposed GRC settlement, the $2 billion of new projects or acquisitions announced since March 2015 or any earnings from our three potential LNG development projects.", "Third, we do not need to issue Sempra equity nor any potential MLP equity in order to finance the base plan. In light of the planned IEnova equity offering we discussed last quarter, we do not need to issue Sempra equity to finance the PEMEX acquisition or any of the announced renewable projects that are incremental to our base plan. Further, we did not include any earnings impacts from a potential MLP in our base plan. Altogether our five-year plan was built on conservative assumptions, and we are on track to meet or exceed our base plan earnings projections.", "Now, let's go to slide 6 for an update on our growth and development opportunities. Beginning with the California utilities, we filed a multi-party GRC settlement agreement for both SDG&E and SoCalGas in September. The settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval.", "Under the agreement, SDG&E and SoCalGas would be allowed revenues sufficient to operate their businesses safely and reliably, and to provide excellent customer service. For 2016 through 2018, the agreement provides annual revenue increases for operations of approximately 3.5%. When including costs subject to balancing accounts, this equates to a total revenue requirement increase in 2016 of $17 million for SDG&E and $122 million for SoCalGas. Both utilities have also reached the second settlement agreement with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates for a four-year GRC term. The four-year term agreement is contingent on approval of our 2016 to 2018 GRC settlement, and on the commission approving a four-year term for all California utilities. If approved, the annual revenue increase in 2019 for SDG&E and SoCalGas would be 4.3%. Recall that our base plan projections assume utility revenues grow annually at the current 2.75% rate of attrition throughout the five-year plan period.", "Moving to Mexico, in July, we announced that IEnova agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in their shared joint venture for approximately $1.3 billion. The acquisition is expected to be about $0.05 accretive to Sempra's EPS in 2016, growing to about $0.10 per share by 2019. We currently expect the Mexican Competition Commission to rule on the transaction this month, and for the equity offering to occur before year end.", "In Mexico, IEnova also submitted a bid for the latest CFE pipeline auction, with award schedule for this week. Together with five other pipeline projects in Mexico that are currently being tendered, the total near-term investment opportunity exceeds $6 billion.", "I also want to mention that the Ministry of Energy has published the long-term plan for development of the national electric system. The plan outlines significant needs for new generation in electric transmission. We expect the initial transmission projects to be bid during the first half of 2016 under new rules of energy reform and IEnova plans to participate in these new markets. We provide more detail in the appendix to this presentation.", "Lastly, I would like to take a moment to comment on the status of Sempra Partners. In June, we announced that our board authorized us to pursue the formation of an MLP. The primary reason to form an MLP is to create a source of competitively priced capital to support Sempra's growth. As you are aware, current MLP market conditions are not ideal, and we will not go forward at this time. We are watching market conditions and we'll reevaluate our position in the middle of next year. In order to preserve this optionality about whether to pursue an MLP, we did submit a confidential S-1 with the SEC. As I stated earlier, we do not require equity from MLP markets in order to finance our base plan and we have flexibility in how we move forward. If we proceed, we will be convinced that the size and sustainability of the long-term value proposition for the Sempra's shareholder is intact.", "Now, please turn to slide 7. With regard to investment opportunities post 2019 that are beyond our base plan period, we continue to make good progress. For Cameron expansion, we filed our FERC application in September and expect to receive FERC approval mid-2016. We received EPC pricing for Train 4 with per train costs that are lower than Trains 1-3. We believe Train 4 could be one of the lowest cost LNG development projects worldwide and competitive in the marketplace. Now that we have firm EPC pricing, we can conduct focused discussions with customers, and we continue to target announcing customer agreements prior to the end of the first quarter of next year. For our Port Arthur project, we have received our DOE FTA authorization and are continuing our project assessment. We are targeting the first half of next year to execute a joint development agreement with Woodside.", "For our ECA liquefaction project, we continue to work on the regulatory and other project development issues with PEMEX. We view both the Port Arthur and ECA liquefaction projects as potentially providing LNG post 2020.", "With that, let's turn to slide 8 for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $248 million or $0.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $250 million or $1 per share. Third quarter earnings in 2014 were $348 million or $1.39 per share.", "Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude expenses related to the development of our three proposed LNG liquefaction projects. Similar to last quarter, we only recorded $2 million of after-tax expense. This number reflects the fact that a substantial portion of the costs are either being capitalized or shared with our Cameron joint venture partners and PEMEX.", "Earnings this quarter include reduced tax expense associated with repatriation. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we intend to participate in the planned IEnova equity offering, and now expect to use about two years' worth of dividends from Mexico that we had originally planned to repatriate. As a result, we expect an approximate $0.10 per share benefit in both 2015 and 2016 from lower than expected tax expense. Our current plan is to resume repatriation from Mexico in 2017 and 2018. I also want to reiterate that third quarter earnings continue to reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas's revenues. This impact resulted in $113 million of lower earnings this quarter and $48 million of lower earnings year-to-date.", "Applying seasonality will have no impact on full year earnings. We will see a $48 million after-tax benefit in the fourth quarter due to seasonality. You can refer to the appendix for additional detail where we illustrate 2014 SoCalGas earnings had seasonality in revenues being applied. Excluding the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas revenues, Sempra's third quarter adjusted earnings increased by $15 million compared to the same period last year. Looking forward, we are now raising our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range to $4.95 per share to $5.15 per share. With regards to 2016 earnings and dividends, we anticipate updating our guidance in February on our fourth quarter call. Our new five-year EPS and dividend projections will be updated at our 2016 Analyst Conference.", "I will note two additional matters. As a result of IEnova's anticipated purchase of PEMEX's interest in their shared joint venture, we expect to record a non-cash gain in the fourth quarter from the step-up of our own investment to fair value. This gain is not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance.", "Finally, as Debbie mentioned earlier, our GRC settlement agreement excludes an issue proposed in the proceeding regarding certain intra rate case income tax benefits relating to repair allowances. The proposal recommended by one of the interveners would require reducing rate base by $93 million for SDG&E and $92 million for SoCalGas. In addition, the proposal seeks to reduce pre-tax revenue requirements related to the 2015 year benefits in the amount of $46 million for SoCalGas and $34 million for SDG&E through the third quarter of 2015.", "Our current expectation is that the CPUC will rule in our favor and do so on the same timeline as our GRC proceedings. That is because the proposed treatment would violate and contradict longstanding rate making and income tax policy. It would also represent a material departure from historical commission practice.", "Please turn to slide 9. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. Key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter include $20 million of higher net operating earnings in Sempra International including foreign exchange impacts, $14 million of higher earnings at SDG&E from higher CPUC base margin net of expenses and higher electric transmission earnings, and $14 million of lower tax expense at the parent related to reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico.", "Offsetting factors include the $113 million seasonality impact that lowered SoCalGas's third quarter earnings and two earnings items that occurred in the third quarter of 2014. One, the $25 million tax benefit for Sempra Natural Gas from the release of a state tax valuation allowance, and secondly the $14 million gain on the sale of a 50% equity interest in the first phase of ESJ in Mexico.", "Now, let me conclude with slide 10. Overall, our financial and operating results for the third quarter continued to be strong, and they positioned us to raise our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range. Increased operating earnings at both the California utilities and Sempra International underpin our solid year-to-date results. Across the company, we continue to capture development opportunities that are incremental to our base plan and look forward to providing you new projections early next year.", "With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Neel.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "How are you?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Great.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "First question was on the pipeline award expected this week. There has been some articles with some bids submitted or published. And it looks like you guys are a close second. Are those apples-to-apples comparisons and does that reflect how the ultimate auction will come out or is that \u2013 or is the CFE still ruling on it?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first, let me say that they just changed the date when we will be notified on the bid to November 10, which is next Tuesday. And if you've looked at any of these bids before, the capital costs are not really reflective of who wins the bid, it's one component of the total bid. The real bid decision is based upon the tariff amount that you are agreeing to provide over the 20 years or 25 years of the contract in all of these pipeline bids, and that's what will be analyzed and looked at next week and announced.", "Capital is a component, your return is a component, what your gas costs for operating the facilities is a component, what you think in terms of additional capacity sales that you might get off of the pipeline, those all factor into the creation of a tariff rate and that's what they will be announcing next week. So, we feel good that we're in a close second, only $4 million behind the low capital, but there is a lot of other factors that will come into the final decision.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. And second question on Cameron Train 4. Has the timeline been pushed out as far as negotiating customer contracts or MoUs, because I think previously you guys mentioned end of the year and I think in your prepared remarks, you said you'd have something maybe by Q1 2016. Can you just remind us of the timeline going forward and the market conditions for additional LNG?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'll start and then I'll have maybe Mark add some additional color to it. But I've been saying in meetings with the investors for some time that we were looking at the end of the first quarter of next year. And that was because we really cannot \u2013 could not even begin negotiating MoUs until we have the EPC contract and we just got that this month. And so now we have the information that we can get a firm price. And we're very pleased that knowing that and getting a firm price, we think Cameron will be one of the, if not the lowest cost facility in the United States for LNG export. And so that allows us to really negotiate a firm MoU. And we followed the same process when we did Trains 1-3. We really needed to know what the cost was going to be in order to have a firm MoU negotiated.", "Mark, do you want to add anything?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. I would just say that we've been having substantive discussions with a lot of potential customers and now we've been able to give them some hard data to work with, and we do expect to show some results. They won't all come at once, and so we expect to have some towards the end of the year and in the first part of next year. But our firm decision to move forward on this would be late in the first quarter.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You might also comment, Mark, on what we see in the contracting area there because I know that there has been a lot of articles and all, and what we've seen is that there are still a lot of parties out there contracting.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. I think there's always \u2013 there's speculation in the press and rightfully so, picking up that LNG is oversupplied up through 2018, but when you start looking at the needs beyond that, when you get into 2020 and 2021, there's definitely a need for additional capacity and we're seeing that. And just to remind the audience, just in 2015 alone, we had 27 contracts signed. And 17 of those were 20-year contracts, four were 10-year and the rest were shorter term contracts. So there is plenty of activity going on, and we are certainly seeing that and we remain very confident that we'll move forward on Train 4.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And, Mark, just to quickly follow up on the comment that off takers will need LNG in 2021. How late can they wait before they sign contracts in order to procure that supply? Do they have another year or is it necessary to make that decision in 2016?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "I think they really got to start making those decisions in 2016, especially for new projects because otherwise they just won't be online in time. We are probably the \u2013 as far as a new train goes, Train 4 can probably come online as probably as quickly or quicker than any other train in the market that's starting anew, and you've got to really kind of make that decision in 2016.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yes.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Julien. We can hear you.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Excellent.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes. Indeed. So, perhaps firstly on Mexico, can you elaborate a little bit on opportunities down there, and I suppose principally focusing on non-oil and gas, but obviously this transmission, there's talk of electric capacity market like procurements, et cetera. What are you guys ranging to do down there at present?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, that's a great thing about Mexico. I think, it's one of our wonderful growth platforms where we see layers of opportunities for our company there. And certainly, there is more bids coming out on pipeline, we'll see $6 billion worth of pipeline bids occur over the next several months and we will be actively involved in that. Following that, they are finalizing the market rules for electric transmission and in our slides we showed you some of the projects that would be up for competition and probably within the first half of next year. And we're very interested in participating in that market. Further, now some of the oil properties are beginning to be taken over as it is and we see some great opportunities to the liquids pipelines that will take how \u2013 take away capacity from some of those PEMEX properties that are now being developed. And also, potentially gathering and processing in those areas.", "And then the generation market we'll be opening and we have, as you know, the ESJ lands, property that could \u2013 we could add about another 1,000 megawatts or more to that area to do wind production. And so we see some great opportunities there. We also see some opportunities to really get some greater value add of our TDM plant. So, I think that and I would also add, I should say, that looking at our existing assets and a great pipeline backbone that we have, we can also add capacity with industrial customers to that and we're working on that right now. So we just see a great worth of opportunities, wealth of opportunities in Mexico and are very excited about it.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Perhaps just a quick follow-up there. TDM, obviously, you've been looking for contracts a while. Is there an opportunity to re-contract that back into Mexico now because of the opening up of this market, I mean is this quote finally going to happen?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Those are the things that we're working on right now and we think that that those rules are getting put in place that would allow us to do it. Mark, do you want to...", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. I was just going to say that the procurement for electricity along the Baja border haven't been let out yet, and so the CFE is working on that, but we fully expect that there'll be opportunities to contract that plant into Mexico. And you will have to weigh that against the opportunities on the U.S. side.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And then lastly bigger picture, if you would, in terms of the U.S. obviously we just talked about Mexico and the range of opportunities, but you all have been pretty active both on gas pipelines and renewables in the U.S. As you think about CPP, California's own 50% RPS, is there anything bigger picture we should be paying attention to, any observation?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean there are two sides of opportunity that we certainly see there. As you know, we do the renewable development and we have the potential to add additional solar project that can sell into the California market. And as you know, since our Analyst Conference, we already got two additional solar projects sold into the California market, and that was before the 50% was adopted. So, we see great opportunities to expand our existing solar facilities. And then in terms of our utilities that the integration of 50% renewables is going to require both gas and electric investment and the reason it requires gas investment is the type of generation that's going to be needed to support renewables in the area is different, and the location of that may be different. And so we're looking at major investments to our gas system to support the future. The North South Pipeline which we have before the commission right now would not only reinforce the system for reliability, but also help provide for that 50% renewable future.", "And then of course on our utility side, we're going to have to make investments, so it will allow us to integrate all of the additional renewables in. So, I think there are some investments that are not part of our current plan right now, North South Pipeline is not part of our base plan nor are additional solar projects, nor are any of the distributed energy resource planning on it. None of that is part of our base 11% growth plan. So, we see that as all potential upside.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning/afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Stephen, how are you?", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Very well, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to talk about dividends from Mexico. It makes perfect sense to use that cash to further invest in the business. As you look out longer term, do you think it's likely you're going to want to think about trying to keep more of that cash within Mexico rather than bring it back in the U.S. It sounds like it's efficient in some ways to do that. I'm just wondering whether you think this is more of a near-term phenomenon or something that we could see you extending out and trying given the excellent growth opportunities in a country.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'll start and then I'm going to turn it over to Joe. I mean I think when we were looking at doing the dividending, it was because we had the net operating losses that we could benefit from. So when we look at the PEMEX deal, it made a lot more sense for us to keep the cash in Mexico for that major project. And so, I think to the degree that we continue to have major projects in Mexico, that would drive some of our decisions there. But why don't you talk about our plans, Joe, and...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Stephen. It's a great question and I'll just go back. I will remind you all that, we essentially built all the equity in Mexico from profits from international operations over the last decade or more and basically doubled the value of that as we took IEnova public. So, it's been a really good investment for Sempra and we will continue to want to invest in it. We do have public shareholders now, so we will pay a good dividend from IEnova and Sempra will receive some of that cash. We don't need to bring it all the way to the U.S. Our current repatriation plan has us doing that through 2018 but as we just said, we're going to hold off on that for two years so we can use that money effectively in this offering. I expect IEnova to keep growing and I would expect us to want to continue to participate in offerings as we go along so that we don't dilute our ownership so much. And so I think what you're suggesting is probably the way it will play out over time and that's been a really good thing for us.", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That makes sense. Great. Thank you. And just on your DRP overall. Shifting gears, any feedback or reaction that you had to the different elements. It sounds like obviously the grid overall needs to change, which you mentioned just a minute ago, but just curious that any color and the kind of feedback that you've received so far.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry. I wasn't quite sure, you're talking about...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Distributed resource plan.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The distributed resource plan. Okay. I'm going to ask...", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's right.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'm going to ask Jeff talk about that. Jeff, do you want to...", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Chief Executive Officer & Director, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.", "Sure. Good morning, Stephen. You recall the kind of focus that program is really intended to make sure that all the investor owned utilities are making the investments, which are necessary to make sure that distributed resources like solar and other resources continue to penetrate the system. And when you kind of compare that to some of the other things we talked about like SB 350; that's designed to make sure there's a lot more central station renewable. So as you have more participation on the central clean energy side and the on the distributed side, it really sets up pretty interesting dynamic for the electric utilities to make more investments around transmission and distribution to accommodate those resources and particularly the unique characteristics of the fact that they're so intermediate \u2013 intermittent.", "But I think that the \u2013 one of the things we keep falling back on is we've got about a $5.8 billion capital program through 2019, and we continue to think of the DRP opportunities, Stephen, it's kind of a longer term opportunity. Part of this maybe definitional in the way some of the different utilities in the state talk about it. But for us, anything that comes out of the DRP, whether it's greater use of batteries, synchronous condensers, more solid state switches, more investments around electric vehicle charging, all of that we would view as being an additive to the plan that we already have from a capital program standpoint.", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Hi, guys. Just a couple questions on clarification and I apologize if I missed it. But what was the assumed annual repatriation from Mexico for 2015 through 2018 in the last five-year plan?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Joe, cover that.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We basically said back in 2012 when we started, Greg, that we were going to do approximately $300 million a year. We didn't break it down between Mexico and Peru, but we set a roughly $300 million a year for that period, 2012 through 2018. And so, we're pulling back on the Mexico piece for this two-year period. So, you can see we're talking roughly around $300 million investment in the IEnova, $300 million to $325 million maybe, something like that. So, if you think about that, cut that in half and you see what the Mexico piece was for a year.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So, you're going to basically keep \u2013 so, you're telling us that $325 million is the amount that you're now not going to repatriate and instead use to help finance...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In the two \u2013 yeah, over the two-year period 2015 and 2016. We already have the 2015 dividend. It's already in a Mexican holding company above IEnova, we'll use that and then we'll borrow some money for a short-term until we get the dividend next year usually in the summer time.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Okay. So, you answered my question without me having to try to figure out on my own $325 million. Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Roughly, right around that.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "And then the second question and it might entail a longer answer is, I know, you told us in the five-year plan what your assumptions were with regard to the general rate case outcome in terms of attrition, it was 2.75% and the repair allowance benefits would be flowed through to customers beginning in 2016. If this deal was approved, I know the attrition adjustments are modestly better. But can you explain the repair allowance \u2013 the prospective repair allowance framework and then also go back \u2013 maybe explain a little bit more what your exposure is perhaps the retroactive look at repair allowance goes against you?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Let me start this because having been in this business for 37 years, I can't help, but make comments on how flawed I think the proposal is. And it was only raised in our case by one of the interveners and what they're basically trying to do is re-coup what had been decided in the last rate case. So, we think it's legal case retroactive rate making and I \u2013 we will fight it as a legal case that retroactive rate making. What in our case is, I just want to talk about our set of facts. Because I think our set of facts is really important. A record in our case was officially closed in July and we did not even file with the IRS for any consideration of a change of tax treatment until after the record had been closed and in the case of SoCalGas, it was more than a year after the record had been closed. So, we think that to try to re-trade this and to go back and recoup those dollars is fully inappropriate. And so we think we have a very good legal standing in our case with our set of facts and we will fight that.", "As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, the dollars that we're talking about or the SDG&E for 2011 to 2014 is $93 million, and for SD \u2013 or SoCalGas is $92 million. And a memo account for 2015 because they were all concerned about the retroactive rate making effect and so they tried to cover it with a memo account. There is SDG&E $46 million pre-tax and SoCalGas $34 million pre-tax through September. We will fight all of this because the history has been very, very clear that it's to the benefit of the customers to have utilities pursue efficiencies and tax benefits and everything. And that the shareholders have to pay for all the research and work that was done to accumulate these benefits. And that the shareholder has always been able to keep those benefits in between rate cases, and then the customer gets them at the next rate case. And when we did our 2016 plan and beyond, we did incorporate in that $40 million reduction at SoCalGas and $19 million reduction at SDG&E starting in 2016 forward for that now going to the customer, which has been the regulatory history of how these things have been dealt with for decades at least since I've been here. So, we think that we will prevail on this issue with our good set of facts and we will continue to fight this, because we think it is a retroactive rate making situation.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So that sums it up, the worst case scenario would be you lose your \u2013 on your legal position and that goes as a reduction to rate base, but prospectively, you worked out how you're going to pull back the benefits?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I mean that's the way it's always been, is that the customer gets the benefits flow through to them at the next rate case and we assume that in our base plan and Dennis and Jeff went through that in March, because we've always had that assumption that come 2016, those will become benefits that will go to the customer.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay, great. And then, a final question amongst the many things you guys have talked about, some \u2013 two of the biggest building blocks for earnings as we go into next year that were not in the base plan are the $0.05 of accretion from the PEMEX, which rises to $0.10 in 2019. And then also the continuation of this $0.10 benefit from not having repatriated cash from Mexico. And then you've got all these other things on the checklist that you've won that weren't in the plan that you delineated earlier as well. Correct?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And some of those don't happen next year that they begin construction but they are not in service next year, so...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Got it. Thank you, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yep.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. How are you? I wanted to just follow up back on Trains 4 and 5 here. Could you maybe give a little bit more color to the extent if there's anything different from what you said earlier in the call about the potential for getting a Train 5 contract signed in addition to just Train 4. And then, could you comment on whether the EPC contract preliminary agreements there were not just good but better than your expectations at all?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'm going to ask Mark to comment on that as he's smiling. So...", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Well, I would say that I'll answer the second question first, which is with respect to the EPC contracts. I think we were pleased with the way the numbers came out. I won't say we were terribly surprised, we suspected that continual construction would lead to a very low cost and we were \u2013 and I think we're proven correct. So, we do believe that it will be beneficial to continue the construction into Train 4 and that will actually reduce the costs for all of the trains in the facility. So, I think it will make Cameron a very competitive facility.", "With respect to any change in the way that we're looking at it \u2013 as to Trains 4 and 5, I think we've said numerous times in the past that the decision to go forward with Train 4 is really a Sempra decision that we've made in conjunction with our partners. And for Train 5, that will be a decision that's made by our partners and they're still contemplating that and whether they go forward at the same time or not is really not \u2013 is their call and really not ours, and frankly not that relevant to our investment decision or our financial outcome.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, shifting gears to the total return vehicle. You mentioned you're going to revisit the idea in the middle of the next year. Is there a reason for that timing specifically, and maybe you can give a little bit more color as to what you would view as a constructive MLP environment out there for you guys to have a low cost of capital?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let me just say that the middle of next year is arbitrary, it's more that we want to see sustained markets that can make us feel that the cost of capital that we would receive by doing it is better than what we would receive at Sempra. And so, we did not want to give you a view that we're going to look at it again next month, and the month after, it's going to be \u2013 we're going to have to see really sustained improvements in the market that cause us to want to launch something on the basis of allowing our growth, this wonderful growth that we have to occur at a lower cost of capital. And if it doesn't deliver that value proposition, then it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to go forward. So, that's how we're looking at.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, hi. Just first, to follow up on that, so is the registration still live for the MLP in the meantime, or is it no longer kind of live?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, the registration can stay live for a period of time, and what we did is we wanted to have full optionality. So, we did this with IEnova, we did a lot of pre-work to be ready to launch if the markets were right. And we ended up actually launching IEnova faster than we thought we would have, because we saw Mexican reform coming, we'd won some pipeline bids and it made sense for us as a way to raise both debt and equity. But we would have to see the same kind of thing for the MLP, and so that's kind of how we're looking at it.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then, apologize to move back to the repair issue, but just to kind of clarify, if we looked at the forward revenue requirement of the utilities, what would be the impact to that beyond what's currently in your plan if this is upheld?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, all I can...", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Is it just the lost return on that rate base or...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there hasn't been a decision in our case. So it's hard to say what it would be. And I will say our set of facts is not exactly the same as another utility's set of facts. So, I wouldn't want to speculate, I told you the amounts of what the tax was over the period of time, but how it ultimately gets treated and everything, that will be litigated in our case. So, I couldn't really speculate on that.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then finally, the $2 billion of upsides \u2013 investment upsides to the plan, which I guess that's also separate on top of the rate settlement separately, but just the $2 billion of investments. Could we just go through those one more time? I know we have \u2013 PEMEX investment is a big one.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Is it the two...", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The PEMEX...", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "...renewables projects?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. There's three renewable projects and then the PEMEX, the PEMEX was about a little over $1.3 billion and then the three renewable projects equate to the remainder. So, I mean that's...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "They are in the slides, Steve, on page 19.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And just at a high level, has anything gotten worse than when you gave the plan, any key drivers or is generally the rest the same?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would say the only thing that is down from the original plans is natural gas prices are down. So, that's a factor in \u2013 and you're looking at 2016, is that what we're talking about?", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "No, the whole five-year plan, the 11% growth...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, so really \u2013 oh, the whole five-year plan. I mean natural gas prices are clearly down almost $2 from when that plan was put together a year ago. And FX, clearly, the dollar has strengthened against all the currencies, that has actually been in our favor right now because the Mexico effect is bigger than the South American effect. So, it's a little bit hard to see how that will play out over the five-year plan period because it depends on what the U.S. dollar does against those three currencies. And I think those are really the two main factors. Everything else is very consistent. We have a very long-term contracted business with a good regulatory model and we just got this proposed decision that \u2013 or I'm sorry, the settlement \u2013 proposed settlement, so feels pretty good.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. The only other thing that I would mention that I didn't mention in terms of the upsides to the plan is that we did get the additional pipeline in Mexico, that's about $110 million. So, they're all listed on slide 19.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Faisel.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Can you remind us also just what the dividend growth rate is along with the base plan for 11% EPS growth 2015 to 2019?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, we had talked about a dividend growth rate that was around 5% to 6%. But that \u2013 and our board considers that every February and the great thing that we have is that we have all of these projects that are long-term contracted and then we will get our GRC decision by February, we will see the progress on construction of Cameron, which is going really well. And we will see if we're getting some contracts on Cameron 4 at that time and so there will be a lot of visibility to things that may cause our board to reconsider, is that the appropriate growth rate over the time through 2019. And so that happens in the February timeframe and we had targeted a 45% to 55% payout ratio at 2019 \u2013 and that, I think there's been no change in that type of a thought process, but what we do in the interim, I think, we're going to be looking at again in February.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And any change in your thought process around M&A? Certainly the midstream and MLP sector has been hit pretty hard, I'm not sure if that changes your calculus around how you look at assets and opportunities?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we always look at \u2013 we've looked at a lot of the MLPs and we looked at \u2013 I think our interests would lie as, we haven't seen anything that is greatly attractive to us in terms of the composite in an MLP. But there are some assets there that if they need the cash and they need to start liquidating some assets that we may be very interested in. And so we've identified things that would be of interest to us and we continue to monitor those and have discussions as appropriate.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "See, let me just add \u2013 if I could just add to that. I see this transaction and the wonderful thing that we have at Sempra is that we have such high organic growth that we don't have to do those kinds of transactions to get our growth. And so I would just tell you all we're really picky about what we would acquire because we've had such success in doing greenfield projects that \u2013 and our returns tend to be higher on all the greenfield projects and the acquisitions. So we're very disciplined when we make acquisitions and I think hopefully you'll see from the PEMEX acquisition. We think it's a very good acquisition for us. It's accretive. It allows us to have a more robust pipeline system that we can grow from. So that's what we really look at.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, understood. And then just on the potential assets in Mexico, I was wondering have you guys looked at exporting LPG, propane and butane out of Mexico. I know a number of people have been trying to figure out how to export LPG out of the West Coast and it's been a difficult process. So I'm just trying to see if you guys have looked at that opportunity and if you think it's a viable option out of the West Coast.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I will have Mark talk about that. I mean, what we have \u2013 we have the ethane pipeline and that we look at all opportunities. We also have the joint venture that we'll continue with PEMEX. And so these are some of the kinds of things that we would see as being potential out of that JV. Mark?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. I would say both in the U.S. and in Mexico we've studied opportunities to export various kinds of natural gas liquids and we haven't put a project together or announced anything, but it's something that we study all the time and I do think there's some interesting opportunities. So it's definitely top of mind. There is a real need to move some of these liquids out of the producing areas, and to the extent that we find an opportunity that works for us, I think we'd be willing to capitalize on it.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, last question from me. Any impact from the hurricane on the West Coast of Mexico to your operations or assets?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "No.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, got it. Thanks.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, guys, real quick...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, guys, real quick question.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "...on the U.S. renewable business. Can you talk about how much incremental room you have for the development of solar projects whether it's Mesquite, Copper Mountain. Really can you just talk about it fleet-wide like almost how much excess room do you have in the backyard, how many megawatts would that potentially create over a long period of time?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "So, I'm going to have Mark address that.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. Hi, Michael. Yeah, we've got about 420 megawatts under construction and with respect to solar, we have about 280 megawatts of property that's still available for development. And then, we're actually in the process of trying to acquire a little bit more to increase that. And then, with respect on the wind side, we have just a flat rate, we have over 200 megawatts that's potentially developable there. And then, of course, at ESJ, we have, I won't say unlimited, but it's a very, very large amount of capacity that's potentially over 1,000 megawatts.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And that can sell both into the U.S. or into Mexico.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Correct. Yeah. So, we do have \u2013 we currently have developable properties that we can and then, obviously, we're looking at new ones all the time.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And how should we think about contract prices and the economics of the projects you announced at the second quarter call versus ones you started development on three years or four years ago?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "I would say that the economics are very similar or sort of within 75 basis points of each other. Our returns, we don't really announce what the returns are, but the prices are cheaper because of the cost of this \u2013 of the product of both in wind and solar has dropped dramatically and that's made a big difference.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks, Mark. Much appreciated.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "All right.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Hey. Good afternoon/good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Thanks for all of the details today. It's been a really helpful call. A couple of just quick questions, just one clarification for the $0.10 \u2013 extra $0.10 in guidance that was assuming approval of the PEMEX buyout this year?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You want me to answer it?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll have Joe answer that. Yeah. Go ahead, Joe.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Mark. No, that was our reassessment of our desire to make the investment of the two years where the dividends, 2015 and 2016 dividends. And so we have recast our tax expense to assume that we will only repatriate this year and next year from Peru and not Mexico, so that's locked in, we are doing that.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Okay, okay. So that decision was certainly not then contingent on approval, okay.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's not contingent on the closing, no. We're just not going to repatriate those monies for 2015 or 2016. We believe that the deal will close and we will fund it. And so there is no contingency there. We've already adjusted in the third quarter tax expense for that and so you'll see also lower tax expense in the fourth quarter combined that will be the $0.10.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Okay, great. Sorry, I was a little confused on that. And more of just a big picture question since it's a new development. With the transmission bids that will be beginning in 2016, how do you view your competitive position there given that your existing relationships in gas is sort of a different ball game, I guess, on the electric side? Can you maybe talk about sort of the competition and the clarity that you've seen around the bid structures, obviously something that took some time to develop with the gas?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think a couple of things. We have some outstanding experience building major transmission projects in difficult areas. Sunrise is probably one of the most difficult transmission projects to get done and it got done on time, on budget. So \u2013 and I think our company has shown our ability to work through regulatory agencies and get all of that done. When you go to Mexico then and you take some of those skills and you transfer that rights of way will be a key issue. It's very similar on the gas and electric side and in fact there may be cases where the transmission could use some existing rights of way that we've already acquired. And then, the siting of the line, the ability to work with the agencies, CFE would be the agency that would be bidding these out and we have good experience working with CFE. And I think having a workforce of several hundred people headquartered in Mexico City that know how to work through these processes, I think that we're in a really good place to enter that area of the business with the experience that we have in Sempra and do quite well in it.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah. And I would just add to that we have developed transmissions lines outside of the U.S. as well. We've been one of the \u2013 we've done a good job of building transmission in Chile, we've built some things in Peru. And so it's not \u2013 we're not without experience outside of the U.S. as well. So, I think given the combination of experience that we have and our relationship with the CFE, I think we're in \u2013 we should be in very good standing to be competitive in that market.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "All right. Thanks for your thoughts, guys.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Sure.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC", "Hi. I wanted to get more understanding on the guidance and the $0.15. So, you increased the midpoint by $0.25 of which $0.10 is taxes. Can you maybe help me understand the other $0.15, since it's not PEMEX?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think if you look at the strength of our business so far this year, you look at how our performance is all of our businesses, and then you adjust for seasonality at SoCalGas, our utilities are having very strong years, our other businesses are having very strong years. So, we look at where we are today and where we think that we will be at the end of the year across all of our businesses. And I think everything is doing very well. So, there is not like one thing that's behind it. There is $0.10 for the tax, the repatriation issue, but the rest of it is across our businesses.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC", "So, it's not one specific thing and it's not GRC and it's not PEMEX, right, it's just kind of spread out...", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the GRC doesn't take effect until next year. PEMEX will not close until later this year, so it won't be until 2016 earnings. So you won't see the GRC effect until 2016 nor will you see the effect of PEMEX until 2016. So it's neither of those, it's just the strength of our base operations across the board.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC", "And then the other part that I'm trying to understand, since you were raised $0.15 but you kept CAGR as the same, is the starting point now high and thus the ending point will \u2013 and is the ending point also higher?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not sure I understood it.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "He is saying we're raising $0.15.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "But keeping the CAGR the same. I mean, we're not setting a new CAGR. Debbie was talking about our approximately 11% CAGR that was in the Analyst Conference. We're not telling you a new number yet. We'll give you a new guidance when we have the conference or what our 2016 to 2020 number is. But we've already said we already know that the numbers are all getting higher, because we have $2 billion more projects, we have a number of positive things going for us. So I think you can glean from that that it wasn't lifting up the front and keeping the end smaller, that's not our intent of this conversation.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. But I will also say that that's a 2015 to a 2019 CAGR. And one of the reasons that has some big effect is that the end of the period what's been great is that we've been able to produce strong results at the beginning of the period. So that Cameron adds a lot in 2018 and 2019 to that growth rate, but we're also growing our business in a lot of other areas and we've had exceptional performance in safety, reliability, customer and financial performance from our utilities as well as our other businesses.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC", "So, what I'm hearing is both conceptually things are going great and mathematically as well, if we just crunch the numbers...", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We just won't tell you what number to forecast, that's it.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Good morning, good afternoon depending how \u2013 wherever you are.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "I'm fine. I'm wondering given the sales to the MLP market and everything, yeah, I'm sure \u2013 I would suspect you have this theory at least some inventory of very mature assets where the EBITDA and everything like that is on full run rate and everything like that and there are other entities that are going to be needing to big machines, so to speak. So, can you give me a sense as to what \u2013 and you guys have always been very, very good at recycling capital. So, can you give us unless I missed this earlier, I did show up a little bit late, I showed up in the Q&A. Can you give a sense as to what might be available in terms of either in some gross EBITDA value or something like that or certain types of assets that you think that it will recycle capital during this period, while you're waiting to see things stabilize if they're all on their optimal run rates?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. If your question is like what is our capital allocation methodology and our enterprise, is that what you're trying to get at?", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Well, I'm trying to get at the fact is that you probably have certain plants or assets or whatever that already at regular run rates and they're contracted and the fact is that those \u2013 in theory would have probably been appropriate for holding on to for an MLP, but if the MLP is going to be pushed off and you have MLPs and YieldCos that are going to need to acquire in order to justify their own cost of capital, the question is whether you have a inventory of assets that you can recycle capital perhaps at better rates than sitting on them right now and just waiting for the MLP market or whatever to turn around?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say that we always look at our assets everyday as if we've just bought the company. And so everything we look at if it is \u2013 makes sense for us to sell it and to exit that, we're willing to do it and same thing in terms of looking at acquisitions. We're very disciplined on that. I will give you examples of what we've done in the past, I can't tell you what we might do in the future, it depends on what the market is, what kind of pricing we could get, but we decided to exit merchant generation because it didn't fit our model and we filled our power plants as an example. So those are the kinds of things that we do on a regular basis and a lot depends on what the market conditions are and what kind of premiums will be paid and whether or not it would make sense for us to exit that, and then redeploy capital into some future growth. And we always think that way, but I'm not going to list any kind of assets that are for sale.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "And I guess I would just add to that too is that, all of our large assets that we expect to be \u2013 essentially fully contracted and moving forward, and if you look at our pipelines in Mexico, our LNG facilities, all of those we believe have expansion capability. And so it's not like \u2013 even though they're fully contracted for their current size, we think all of them can \u2013 especially in Mexico, we're in the process of expanding capacity on some of our existing pipelines and adding additional revenue. We're looking obviously at Train 4 to Cameron. We're looking at additional facilities. So I think we've got a lot of growth left in a lot of our major assets. So we really wouldn't be looking at that at this time. We want to be completely sure that we capture all of that growth and all of that additional revenue. But I think for more mature assets down the road, as Debbie said, we always look at that stuff.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Well, maybe the point I was trying to distinguish between kind of legacy, fully mature assets that are at their full EBITDA run rates or whatever where there is not \u2013 it's obviously contributing, but there is not necessarily \u2013 that's not the growth component. And I'm trying to distinguish that between Mexico expansions or Cameron or whatever. And I just don't know what your \u2013 what the pot might be that because you guys have been one of the best in our industry in terms of recycling capital. So I'm just curious if you can give a sense of what that. Assuming this is the way you're thinking about whether there is a part of recycle book capital that is sitting there that's depending on given the other market participants. That's what I'm trying to get a sense of.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that when we look at what we've had, all I can tell you is what we've done historically and we did that with coal plants that we bought and we sold that when we thought the market was changing. We did that when our generation plants came off the DWR contracts and that they no longer fit our model because we go for long-term contracts. So we always look at the market and we always look at what's left in our contracts. What we think is a little chance of re-contracting, is there more value there to us that we could get out of the asset. I mean, that's the way we look at it and so I am not going to go through how we would look at specific assets, but I can tell you that's the methodology we use.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Well, one last question and I'll let someone else go. And given that history and the way you describe it, what starts bidding that type of thing to be examined, like for instance, gas storage, the Mid-South (67:20) or something like that. I'm just curious \u2013 I'm sure, not everything is perfect. So, the fact is \u2013 and you guys have always been very, very good at identifying that. So, I just want to get a sense of what might be available just to recycle and optimize?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I just don't think I can answer what we would plan to look at selling. I think I can tell you what the methodology is. And when we look at an asset like storage, I can tell you it's at very low values right now in comparison to what it's been in the past, but you see what's happening in the gas market and you see what's happening relative to coal to gas conversion and the need for storage by utilities and then all of the LNG plants in the Gulf. So the way we would look at an asset like that is do we think it could have greater value to our shareholders in the future, and are there ways to optimize that, and how much could we get to sell it in the market, and that's the way we would always look at those kinds of assets. So, I really don't think I can give you a list of what we would be considering \u2013 that wouldn't even be a good thing to do for our shareholders in terms of any kind of negotiation. So, I think that's all I can really say.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. I'll let other people ask questions. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "How are you doing? Just, I know you've been asked this by Greg and Steve, but I just want to make sure I have a better understanding. With respect to the repairs deduction rate base potential impact, you mentioned a couple of different numbers, you mentioned memorandum account numbers. And I just wasn't sure what \u2013 on a corporate wide basis, what kind of rate base is actually sort of being challenged here retroactively, which you guys don't plan on \u2013 I understand you guys don't feel a valid challenge. But I just wanted to know what we're quantitatively roughly speaking about?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Joe, I'm going to ask you to cover it...", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "...and see if you can explain it better than I did.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, you explained it well. I think that the proposal suggested that we took the 2011 to 2014 savings and that added up to $185 million on a Sempra-wide basis, roughly split between the two utilities, and that would be what they suggested should be reduced from rate base going forward. So, you can do the math and figure out what that would mean to a revenue requirement. Again, we don't believe that's going to be sustained.", "The memorandum account really dealt with 2015 and they treated that separately, they're trying to get around retroactive rate making, as Debbie suggested. So, the sum of the two numbers that she gave you, and they were in my remarks as well, totaled $80 million on a pre-tax basis through September, less than $50 million after-tax. That would be a 2015 impact, that wouldn't go to rate base, it would just be a direct impact, that they were requesting. This is what they requested as a way to get around the retroactive rate making. We don't think they will be able to sustain it. But that's the way it would work. So, the rate base is only that $92 million and $93 million.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me further say, though, who the \"they\" is, because what I want to stress is that we don't have a proposed decision that does this.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The \"they\" is TURN, one of the interveners in the case and this is their proposal in the case. And so we have not yet received a proposed decision and we will make a very strong case that the record was closed, officially closed by the ALJ before we even filed with the IRS to make these changes. So, I just want to be sure that the facts are really clear on this.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "No, absolutely, and I apologies for having \u2013 there were a few numbers running around that I wanted to make sure I understood them.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No. It was a good question. I am glad you clarified.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And then with respect to the master limited partnership vehicle and what have you, it seems to me that people \u2013 the Street and what have you sort of wanted you guys to move faster on this a while ago, and I don't know, you guys didn't, and the situation has changed and you guys are looking at what the opportunities might be on a sustained basis. I am just sort of wondering, I mean strategically when you see something like what's happened in the markets and what have you, whether or not it makes the bar higher or you think more about how you might want to unwind something, if it ends up that \u2013 I mean because obviously these are not really short-term financing plans. These are supposed to be vehicles that last for a period of time. And I am just wondering when you have something that we just recently experienced, what does that make you think about \u2013 I mean, in terms of \u2013 does it make the bar higher? I mean, what do you guys think about it, I guess, is what I am asking? I mean, sort of a little bit more elaboration in terms of obviously if it doesn't make sense, you're not going to do it, but not only that, if it \"does make sense\" for a period of time, does \u2013 what would give you \u2013 do need more confidence in terms of that or just how do you think about that, do you follow what I'm saying?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll start a little bit and then I'm going to ask Mark to add to that. I think that one of the things that became apparent was that there is some limited liquidity in that market. And that the effects were great when people needed to change portfolios and clear out of that market, and that creates a sense of discomfort for us, because that's not what we see in the Sempra stock. And so what we want to be able to see is that there is the ability to have \u2013 and that you can differentiate, and I think you still do see that in the market. You can differentiate quality from things that are not quality, and quality continues to trade well even if that whole market segment is not trading as well. Because I mean that's always been what we've been after is if we're going to do this, it's going to be all about quality, and that if we can't get the value for that quality, then it doesn't make sense for us to go forward. So, Mark, do you want to add?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah, I guess my only add to that would be \u2013 I think when we looked at this, in the beginning I think we had some skepticism and then as we watched these things progress over the last few years, it was clear to us that there was a cost of capital advantage to these entities and that was worth taking advantage of and we had ideal assets, and we still do have ideal assets for that kind of vehicle that was valuing cash flows at very high multiples or very low yields. But I think to your point, Paul, and it's a very good one, which is does this disruption in the market give us some pause to think that this was more \u2013 something like a passing fad. And I think at the end of the day, I think there's a high probability that these long, sustainable cash flows will continue to garner a yield that makes the capital look really \u2013 that makes the cost of the capital look really attractive.", "But I do think that we have to kind of make sure that we're in a market that supports that for the long haul and that there's enough liquidity in that market that, as Debbie said, the ones that have \u2013 that truly aren't tainted by underlying commodity prices can shine, and can still garner that low cost. And that's got to be proven and whether that can happen in the next six months or a year, we don't know. But I think we're going to keep our options open and look at it and take advantage of it, if it makes sense. And if it doesn't, we're perfectly okay to keep \u2013 to do the course that we are on, which is just as a C corp and I think we can be very competitive with cost of capital and we've got a great business here. So the good news is our underlying assets and business are super \u2013 are just really sound and we don't have to avail ourselves of any one particular mechanism to raise capital. We have lots of opportunities for that and we can meet our capital needs without any real problem.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, great.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me just add on one more thing and Mark just alluded to it. But you guys may or may not have seen this, in the last several months including last week, we got a affirmation of our credit ratings and S&P just moved us to a stronger business risk profile from strong to excellent. We've a very strong business and we can finance our growth and this was an opportunity to maybe do something that was really cheap and good. And so to everything Mark and Debbie said, I just want to add that, we have a very strong credit ratings and we can finance our growth, we will need it.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Great. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "A quick follow-up question. Can you just go through in a little more detail what your net exposure is to currency with Mexico offsetting the exposure in Chile and Peru. And then sort of a secondary question on that is in the places where you're dollar denominated, I know that functionally inflates you, but if we continue to have a strong dollar, doesn't that put pressure on the regulatory construct and how do we think about risk in that framework?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Joe, do you want to take that or Trevor?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I will speak first and then I'll let Trevor go through all the numbers of the net exposure and so forth. But as you know, we have a natural hedge here because we have when the dollar strengthens on all three of the currencies, in Chile and Peru, we have a reduction of our growth because of the translation of the two currencies in South America to the dollar by offsetting that is the fact that we do have dollar functional currency in Mexico because fundamentally most of the businesses are in dollars. So we pay our taxes in pesos and we have some other adjustments in the income tax expense as a function of their income tax rules that impact us in the opposite direction when all three currencies decline. And so that's what we've seen over time. So I'll let Trevor walk through what the numbers were for the quarter...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Sure, Greg", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "...and year-to-date.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Yeah. So for the quarter, we had a total decline in earnings from translation of the earnings of about $6 million for the quarter between Chile and Peru and that is more than offset by a $17 million pickup in Mexico and as Joe said that, that's primarily from the revaluation of the taxes. So the net benefit in the quarter was $11 million. And then year-to-date, it's not much different, it's about $14 million of a benefit year-to-date and that was driven by $13 million of the P&L hurt that we took in the translation of the earnings from Chile and Peru offset by $27 million net of NCI for Mexico, giving us a net benefit year-to-date of $14 million.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "And, Greg, let me just add to that. In South America, you're on point and say, we do get adjustments in our tariff primarily from inflation, but also FX too. But what we have seen in South America this year, it's a little bit unusual. We've seen currency devaluation without underlying inflation in those countries. So, we're not getting the inflation adjustments for our tariff. So, it's really not putting as much rate pressure on as you might expect. I'm not sure that's a good thing. I mean, we'd like to get the adjustment, but we're just not seeing high inflation in those countries. What we're seeing is just strengthening of the dollar and is probably more has to do with more U.S. policy and the strength of the dollar worldwide than it has to do with really underlying weakness in those economies.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay, so \u2013 sorry, go ahead.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Go ahead, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I was going to say you move into next year and you update your five-year plan to the extent that currencies have moved dramatically, that would be reflected in your update on expected earnings from those jurisdictions, right?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yes.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Yeah, what we'll do and why we don't give you numbers until February, as we look out the forwards at that time for currency and natural gas prices, and we adjust our plans for those things as well as the additional growth that we've had in our businesses, outcomes like the GRC and all. So that's why we wait to give you our 2016 forecast in February and then at the Analyst Meeting in March, we'll give you additional information for the next five years.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "But in your opening comments, you didn't seem like you're too concerned that this one factor would knock you off the aspirations that you currently have?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we wouldn't \u2013 based upon what we see in currencies now, we wouldn't see that and then gas prices are so low now, they've already been reflected to a great degree, and this is just pro forma. So, I guess they can always go lower, you can never say they won't go lower, but we have pretty low gas prices now. So...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thank you. Have a good afternoon.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Thanks, Greg.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now take a question from Feliks Kerman with Visium Asset Management.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Ashar Khan (81:30). How are you guys doing and great results? One thing...", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Unknown Speaker", "...which I picked up on the remarks is that we have a settlement with the commission that we might get a fourth year of the rate case with an attrition mechanism if I heard that correctly. Could you just go over that I might have heard it wrongly?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. No, you heard it correctly that with the ORA, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, we have a settlement for fourth year that would give us a 4.3% attrition for that fourth year and that will be looked at by the commission separate from our other settlements. So we have a settlement with eight parties for the three years and then we have a settlement with one party for the fourth year, that party being the Office of Ratepayer Advocates.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much and great results.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Reed, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks", "Debra L.

Just as a reminder today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, Debbie Reed, Chairman and CEO, Mark Snell, President, Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer, Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel, Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer, Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas, Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2016 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide four and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rick. Before discussing the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the natural gas leak at our Aliso Canyon storage facility. On February 18, the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR, confirmed that the leaking well is permanently sealed. Our focus since the beginning has been on safely stopping the leak, reducing the odor from the well, reducing the amount of natural gas being emitted into the environment, working cooperatively with agencies and elected officials and supporting local residents, including providing temporary housing and air filtration system.", "Now that we have stopped the leak, an independent investigation of the root cause will be conducted. I want to emphasize that providing safe and reliable service to our customers is the highest priority for SoCalGas. We will continue to work with our regulators and customers to ensure our path ahead reflects these values. Later, I will provide more information on Aliso Canyon, and Dennis and Martha are also here to address your question.", "Turning to our financial performance; in 2015, we had very strong results and exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $5.37 per share, or $5.21 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2015 results were driven largely by growth in operating earnings at our California Utilities and Sempra International.", "In addition, our board approved an increase in the 2016 dividend to $3.02 per share. This payout represents an 8% annual increase and provides dividend growth that more closely aligns with the 11% annual increase in our 2015 adjusted earnings. Moreover, we are targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years, to better align our dividend growth with our projected EPS growth. Our dividend strategy is underpinned by confidence in our future cash flows and supports our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.", "Regarding 2016 earnings; we have updated our assumptions, and are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 per share to $5.20 per share, when compared with the 2015 results, we forecast a higher effective tax rate for 2016. In part this is due to a large number of benefits recorded last year that related to the resolution of tax matters.", "Also as we move into the new GRC cycle at our California utilities, we will now be providing an estimated $60 million of repair allowance tax benefits to ratepayers as part of the standard rate case true-up. In our 2016 adjusted guidance, we assume that we retain all repair allowance benefits for tax years preceding our new GRC.", "Key updates and comparison to the 2016 guidance we provided at last year's Analyst Conference reflect several other factors. Notably, we include our best estimate of the GRC decision for the California utilities, based on our settlement agreement, as well as new market assumptions for commodities and foreign exchange rates that have changed considerably since last year.", "Additionally, our adjusted guidance range now includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of estimated LNG development expense. Regarding transactions we announced last year, that were additive to our base plan, such as the potential PEMEX acquisition and new renewable contracts, we expect our earnings impacts to largely occur in 2017 and beyond.", "Please note that our proposed GRC settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval and we do not anticipate receiving a final decision until the second quarter. We have moved our Analyst Conference to May in order to incorporate an expected final GRC decision. And we'll provide you with our business unit guidance and longer-term projections at that time.", "Overall, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term strategy of providing earnings growth that is twice that of the average utility but with a moderate risk profile. Combined with strong anticipated growth in the dividend, we are focused on providing top-tier shareholder return.", "Now, please turn to slide five. This slide summarizes the key assumptions included in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. I will briefly discuss each item and you can find additional detail in the appendix. First, as I mentioned earlier, this year, we include developing costs for our LNG liquefaction and related infrastructure opportunities.", "In 2015, we had about $10 million of similar expense that was excluded from adjusted guidance due to uncertainty about the nature and timing of these costs. Given progress on the projects and our estimates of the spend rate and amounts capitalized and shared with partners, we now include a 2016 after-tax expense of roughly $0.08 to $0.10 per share.", "Please note, however, that the vast majority of planned expenses targeted for Port Arthur and related infrastructure as we have already incurred most of the upfront costs for Cameron expansion. Going forward, we will be sharing cost for Port Arthur with our partner Woodside. We will nevertheless monitor our progress in securing market commitments and other needed approvals to advance the project. To the extent, our progress is slower than expected, we will adjust our spending accordingly.", "Next, we've seen a significant decline in natural gas price forecast over the past year. Specifically, the Cal border 2016 forward curve has fallen from $3.60 in our prior guidance to $2.60 in our new adjusted guidance. The impact from this assumption is a reduction in earnings of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share that is associated with the LNG marketing contract from our ECA import facility in Mexico.", "Third, we reduced projected earnings from the TDM power plant due to lower power prices and lower expected capacity revenue. This month IEnova decided to hold the assets for sale. The sale would complete our exit from merchant generation and allow IEnova to deploy capital and projects that provide more stable earnings. While we project approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of reduced earnings associated with TDM, we do not consider any potential gain or loss from the sale in our adjusted guidance.", "Moving to Parent, we assume that we will use dividends from Mexico to participate in a potential IEnova equity offering. We forecast a 2016 earnings benefit from lower repatriation tax expense of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share. Offsetting this impact is an estimated $0.04 per share after-tax of higher interest expense to fund projects in our base plan.", "Next, like natural gas prices we have seen exchange rate forecast moved significantly over the past year. Relative to our previous guidance, our current forecast is for the dollar to strengthen in 2016 by an additional 20% against the Chilean currency and by an additional 13% against the Peruvian currency. Projected earnings are reduced by roughly $0.09 to $0.11 per share as a result of translating South American earnings into dollars.", "In Mexico, we have not previously forecast the impact of foreign currency effects. We now include in our adjusted guidance a reduction in tax expense associated with peso depreciation during 2016. Based upon the forward curve at year-end, we estimate this benefit to be approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share. With regard to IEnova's acquisition of PEMEX, this ownership and their shared joint venture, Mexico's Competition Commission has required PEMEX to competitively auction two assets included in the original transaction.", "IEnova is negotiating changes to the original agreement with PEMEX that will reflect the auction outcome among other things. Our adjusted guidance assumes that the transaction moves forward with the same assets and closes in the third quarter of 2016. Based on this timing, we assume an estimated $0.02 of accretion this year. Our adjusted guidance excludes however, any potential gain associated with the remeasurement of our investment in the joint venture.", "In our Renewables business, we incorporate new forecast for wind resource and availability that reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. However, our base plan now includes 328 megawatts of additional projects announced last year that are under construction. Given that these projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, we expect to see the full earnings impact beginning in 2017.", "Finally, for the California utilities, our prior guidance was based on a very conservative assumption that revenues would be based on our current attrition mechanism with no further adjustments. Our new adjusted guidance range includes projected earnings that are more closely aligned with the GRC settlement agreement, and our best estimate of the outcome given the record in the preceding.", "Now, let's go to slide six for our business update, beginning with the California utilities. In our general rate case, we are currently expecting to see a proposed decision in March and to receive the final decision in the second quarter. As you recall, we reached a multiparty settlement agreement with the major parties in the case. Until we get a final GRC decision, we will record revenues based upon the authorized revenue requirement in 2015. When we receive the final decision, we will make an adjustment to reflect the retroactive earnings back to January 1, 2016.", "Turning to Aliso Canyon; we have received confirmation from DOGGR, the California agency responsible for regulating gas storage, that the leaking well has been permanently sealed. We have approximately 15 Bcf of natural gas in the storage field and the field is stable. Moving forward, an independent engineering firm has been selected by DOGGR and the CPUC to investigate the root cause of the leak. While we do not know how long this process will take, we will cooperate on the investigation and share publicly available data.", "Consistent with new rules under development, we are implementing enhanced leak detection and well inspection activities. We are also working cooperatively with all of the agencies involved to determine a path forward for the facility, which is regarded as integral to the reliability of the electric grid in California.", "Reflecting the most up-to-date information, which primarily includes revised temporary relocation and well drilling expenses, we now estimate the total costs or amounts to pay (13:45) and those forecasted to be paid to be approximately $330 million. Of this amount approximately 90% is for the temporary relocation program cost to address the leak, and attempts to stop or reduce the emission. The remaining amount includes among other items, the value of lost gas and estimated cost to mitigate the GHG emissions. For the estimate, we assume the relocation period for the majority of residents ended on February 25, as they agreed upon with the City of Los Angeles. We have concluded it is probable that we will receive insurance recovery for the total amount, less retentions of $325 million.", "Beyond this estimate, we cannot predict all of the potential categories or total amount of future costs that we may incur as a result of the leak. We have at least four types of insurance policies that provide in excess of $1 billion in insurance coverage. Based upon what we know today and subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, we believe that our insurance should also cover the following categories not included in our estimates. Costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses and in some circumstances depending upon their nature and manner of assessments, fines and penalties. I refer you to our 10-K for further details.", "Please turn to slide seven. In Mexico, CFE is tendering several more gas pipelines. IEnova submitted a bid for one pipeline earlier this month, is in process of submitting a bid for second and is preparing to submit a third bid in March. According to CFE estimates, the three pipelines represent an investment opportunity of almost $2 billion, and we expect award dates to occur in March and April. This spring IEnova is also preparing to participate in Mexico's first auction of renewable energy certificates. IEnova is looking at potential solar opportunities and may submit a bid to expand the ESJ wind facility with this joint venture partner InterGen.", "The CFE would be the initial off taker under 15-year to 20-year contracts, and total awards could amount to 2,500 megawatt of new power generation. In our LNG business, there have been two noteworthy development. Our Cameron expansion project received its FERC environmental assessment on February 12, and we expect to receive the FERC permit in the second quarter.", "Though current market conditions are not ideal, Cameron train 4 is a very competitive market offering for long-term buyers. Based on recent meetings with potential customers, we are bypassing the memorandum of understanding stage and are in negotiations for definitive 20-year sales and purchase agreement.", "While our sales and purchase agreement will take longer to execute than an MoU, we are targeting the second half of 2016 for announcing customer agreements needed to launch the project. This approach provides us greater certainty on project commitments, prior to incurring large capital expenditures.", "For Port Arthur, yesterday, we signed a joint development agreement with Woodside Petroleum that outlines development roles in the potential project. In addition to how we will share costs and market capacity, the agreement provides a framework for how we will work together technically to design a cost competitive plant.", "Last month, I was in Australia meeting with the CEO and senior management of Woodside, and we shared the view that Port Arthur has good market prospect post 2020. Before moving on, remember that we have not incorporated additional LNG or other growth projects in our guidance. We are actively working on development opportunities across our businesses that could provide upside to both our near-term and long-term projection.", "With that, please turn to slide eight and Joe will discuss our financial results. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million, or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses related to the development of our proposed LNG liquefaction project.", "In addition, in October 2015 an agreement was reached with the SONGS insurance provider for a $400 million payment associated with the failure of the replacement steam generators. Of this amount, SDG&E's share was $80 million. After reimbursement of legal fees and an allocation of $75 million of net proceeds to the ratepayers, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings exclude a $2 million after-tax adjustment to the loss on the SONGS plant closure.", "Full year 2015 earnings totaled $1.349 billion, or $5.37 per share. This compares to 2014 earnings of $1.161 billion, or $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2015 earnings were $5.21 per share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings grew 11%.", "Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation, entitled business unit earnings. I will address the key drivers for our consolidated quarterly results, now on slide nine. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter earnings include a $48 million seasonality impact that increased earnings of SoCalGas. We call that applying seasonality to earnings of SoCalGas does not affect full year results, instead this fourth quarter variance offset seasonality impacts during the first three quarters of the year.", "At Parent, we recorded $21 million of lower tax expense, primarily related to a favorable resolution of prior year's income tax matters and reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. The lower tax expense at Parent, along with lower effective tax rates of the California utilities were primary reasons why we exceeded our revised 2015 adjusted guidance that we gave on our third quarter call.", "Third, SoCalGas recorded $16 million of higher earnings due to a higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses and offsetting these factors was $18 million of lower tax expense in South America in 2014, as a result of Peruvian tax reform.", "Now, let's conclude. So please turn to slide 10. Overall, we delivered strong financial results in 2015 and exceeded our adjusted guidance. Solid growth in operating earnings and confidence in our long-term cash flows supported our decision to raise the 2016 dividend. In order to better align our future dividend growth with projected EPS growth, we are now targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years.", "Looking ahead over the next five years, we continue to anticipate earnings growth around twice the level of our utility sector average. Combined with the strong dividend growth, we aim to provide top-tier total shareholder returns.", "With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and start to take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Debbie, I know that it's not \u2013 in the normal course, you usually don't update your five-year earnings growth forecast until the Analyst Day. But can I take from your comments early in your presentation that you still feel like the fundamental building blocks in the prior five-year plan that drove the earnings growth you articulated last February, are still substantively in place?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Greg, I think that's an excellent way to put it actually. If I look at the fundamental building blocks, as you know, our business is based upon long-term contracted and utility asset. And when we lay out our growth rate, the key things that are driving our growth longer-term are Cameron 1 through 3, which is progressing on schedule, on budget and we expect that to come online in 2018, as we've outlined before.", "Our Mexican pipelines are now, all except for three of them are actually in operation that are contracted, and so that is going quite well. And then our utility businesses and the fundamentals of our utility businesses as you can see from last year's earnings are very strong. And we would anticipate getting a rate case decision soon and one reason we want to hold off providing any numeric guidance is that we want to get that rate case decision and then be able to go through as we always do with you at the Analysts Meetings the details.", "The other thing I'd just comment on is, our board felt that there is great visibility to our growth. And since it's long-term contracted in utility, they were very comfortable, setting an 8% to 9% target for our dividend increases over the next several years. And I think that is a really strong statement in our sector to be able to grow your dividend at that kind of rate.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Right. And that's up from the last articulated target of 6%, correct?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We had talked before of about 6% growth rate in the dividend and now we're talking about 8% to 9% over the next several years.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Shifting gears to Aliso. You've articulated what your estimate is relative to the line items you've laid out. As we go forward here and we think about the path to understanding whether or not there will be further costs as they relate to fines or penalties. Which of the primary agencies that will be reviewing the safety, efficacy, performance of the plant? And if there were to be fines or penalties, in what categories would they potentially fall and who would be the agency that would be deciding whether or not to implement them?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me just start by saying that the key agencies that are doing the investigation are the Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR, and the CPUC. And they're now beginning the investigatory phase to see what's happening on the leak.", "I'm going to refer to Martha regarding the whole scope of agencies that would be involved and how we deal with fines and penalties. I will say though that there haven't been any that have been assessed. So, it's kind of hard to estimate anything. Martha?", "Martha Brown Wyrsch - Executive Vice President & General Counsel", "Thank you, Debbie. That's correct. The DOGGR and the California PUC are the primary agencies that would be \u2013 are investigating, and would potentially fine the company for what they discover in the investigation. And as Debbie said in her remarks earlier, our insurance coverage is quite broad with the four insurance policies that we have, and we do believe that in certain circumstances and depending on the nature and manner of the assessment, that insurance should cover fines and penalties.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Last question, in the California utilities bucket of things that have changed, I just wanted to be clear on my understanding. The first thing that's changed \u2013 has changed is or one of the things that's changed is you're no longer budgeting for $60 million of repair allowance and tax benefits. But the other thing that's changed is you've updated your assumptions for to take into account what you believe the impact is of the underlying economics of the settlement. Are those the two major changes?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Greg, that's correct. As we've looked at this, we told you last March that, when \u2013 under the rate case process that when we go through the rate case process, that there will be a true-up on this repairs allowance, and that was approximately $60 million. So, our earnings would be reduced for that going into 2016 in our utilities. But then we've reached this rate case settlement and when we've laid out kind of our guidance for 2016, our assumptions are and our range is that something similar to the rate case settlement would be adopted, and that's what we would anticipate.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me, Debbie this is...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "$60 million is after-tax right?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey Greg, Greg...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Sorry.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, because it's a tax item, but Joe wants to say something.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Greg, this is Joe. I just want to make sure just to be clear for you and others, the $60 million was taken into account in the guidance we gave you last year for 2016. So that's not something that was new in our new introduced guidance today, but the GRC settlement was new, but the $60 million was in last year's number.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So $60 million was baked into the February guidance number? Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. But it's important to understand because it's a difference going from 2015 to 2016. So it's a critical item to understand.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Got you. Thank you. I'll get off now. Thanks.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "We'll move next to Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Hi, good morning. Apologize to answer. To ask a question that you probably don't want to directly answer right now, but just you're on the one hand saying the 8% to 9% -", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yes, can you hear me?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I can hear you now.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Now we can hear you. We honestly did not cut you off.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We can hear you now.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "You might regret that you didn't after I ask this question. But so just on the long-term growth rate, so we have two data points today. We have twice the utility average, and we have 8% to 9% dividend growth that better aligns with long-term earnings growth. Is it fair to say the 8% to 9% is not a view of your long-term earnings growth?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, that's fair to say. I mean I'll answer that question. And I'll give you a \u2013 I'll use 2015 as an example. We grew 11% in 2015, we increased our dividend by 8%. So I would not link the two directly together. What I would look at is, what are the fundamentals of the growth drivers? And the fundamentals of the growth drivers are Cameron getting online on time, our utilities performing well and our Mexican pipelines being constructed and in service and all of that is going quite well.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then on the Cameron 4 update and the decision to move to directly to a contracting as opposed to an MoU, could you just maybe give a little bit more color on why you're doing that, and is that something the customers want or is that something that's better for you so you don't have to commit as much up front? I wasn't sure I understood the rationale there.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'm going to ask Oct\u00e1vio to cover that, but what I would say is, we see it as better for us, because we do have a timeframe by which we have to commit to get Cameron in service and maintain continuous construction. So actually getting the sales and purchase agreements done and have definitive agreement is a real positive for us, so this is something we like to have in place.", "Oct\u00e1vio why don't you have a talk about it from the customer perspective as well.", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - President, Sempra LNG Corp", "Sure. Thank you. The reason why is because as Debbie indicated, we have a timeframe that's tight and we're trying to take advantage of the long-term pricing that we have from our EPC contractor. So going through an MoU, we'd (30:58) create an additional step that might drag that schedule. And as you know, given the way, we structure our deals on the LNG. We're not just selling cargos for a price, which would be a much easier sale. We're actually putting together deals that deal with low commodity risk and essentially long contracting capacity for the liquefaction, so we have to speak a lot to our customers about the upstream conditions, where the gas comes from, where it's delivered, how it's delivered and those tend to be more complicated sessions.", "And as a result, we've all decided to go forward. It wasn't just us, the customers also decided to go that way. So the people we're talking to at this point, we've all agreed to pursue the supply purchase agreements and gas supply agreements as part of our discussions in order for later in the year to have the full commitment to take the commitments we need to make on the capital side to launch the project.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. And one last question on Aliso. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the \u2013 and I know this is hard without the root cause analysis. But one is, the potential scenarios of fixes for the future. And then I guess the second question is, it does seem like Aliso is a critical facility for reliability in California. Could you talk a little bit about that issue and this conflict with some people wanting it not to start up?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'm going to have Dennis address that. What I will say is that the DOGGR has come out with a new set of rules that we're already implementing, and that they are very, very parallel to what we filed a few years back in our rate case for our program that's called Storage Integrity Management Program or SIMP. And so, I think that there are processes and things that we actually envisioned and already had filed for in our rate case that would allow us to safely operate this field going forward.", "Dennis, do you want to address further?", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Sure. Good morning, Steve. Yes. As Debbie talked about our SIMP program and you know at the utilities we have an acronym for everything. But we actually started on a pilot program back in 2014, even before we got an approval. And as you know, we have requested within our general rate case for additional funding for our Storage Integrity Management Program. So that, we're waiting for the final decision there.", "As far as the importance of Aliso and just gas storage in general to both gas and electric reliability, I think it's been very clear with a lot of the comments by both policy and regulatory leaders, especially coming from the California Energy Commission as well as the PUC that it's vital that we have safe and reliable gas storage to support not just gas demand, but especially in the Los Angeles basin electric reliability as well.", "So, we're pleased to see that even in the visit that Department of Energy, Secretary Moniz, when he came out and visited, he reemphasized the importance of making sure that obviously, the facilities are safe, but that we have been back online in order to support both gas and electric reliability. So we know that there is, as Debbie mentioned, there is a full process that's been approved by DOGGR on their comprehensive safety review, we're working very closely with them on that. There is also some legislation that's been presented that, so far is open to amendments to incorporate as a process that DOGGR has laid out. So we're optimistic that sounder minds now from a policy, regulatory and political side recognize the importance of getting Aliso back online as safely and as expeditiously as possible.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Moving on to Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Hi good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Neel.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "It's been awhile since we've gotten an update on Mexico. Obviously, you have three bids coming up that are pretty important. Could you just comment on the competitive environment there, and what you're seeing and possible opportunities beyond just the CFE pipes at this point?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, and I'll have Mark talk about some of the upcoming bids, but what \u2013 a couple of things I've said before and I'll say again in terms of Mexico and the key thing for us is that we have a really great set of assets in Mexico, that are expandable assets that have additional growth potential.", "And so, these bids are very important to expand the infrastructure that we own there, but they are not the only way that we can grow in Mexico. And Mexico now have some pipeline bids that are going to be coming for us very soon, we've talked about the three that are out for bid right now, there will be others that will come out later this year.", "Mexico is also going out for bids for about 2,500 megawatts of renewables. And we have our ESJ plant operational there, that has the availability to expand by about a 1,000 megawatt. So, we think that's a great opportunity and then at Mexico is looking at going into other areas of bidding with electric transmission and electric generation. So, there's bidding but there is also growth potential that occurs from the great asset base that we have there. Mark, do you want to talk about kind of the bids and...", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Sure, Debbie. There is \u2013 as you know there is three pipelines right now that are currently under that we have submitted bids for and we're awaiting the determination. In total, it's roughly a couple of billion dollars' worth of work. We think, we're well positioned for it, but as you've seen there are \u2013 there has been some increased competition for some of these pipeline bids, but we're sticking to our kind of strategy of targeting kind of high single-digit IRRs and we're really looking to try to pick up these ones that we think fit our \u2013 that fit our profile and what we're looking for and obviously, we're interested in these at the right price.", "But I think the most important thing is Debbie's point is on the opportunities around our existing pipeline footprint, which, just to remind everyone, we are the largest pipeline operator in Mexico. We're very well-positioned, not only for this new work, but to expand those opportunities and start building laterals into other industrialized areas. And so, we see the opportunity for IEnova in Mexico for continued growth.", "And I think we've all seen some of the comments on PEMEX over the last few days and their desire to raise additional capital and to think about selling some of their additional assets, we're very well poised to take advantage of those opportunities, our relationships there are very strong. And so, we're very optimistic about IEnova's growth potential.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay. So to summarize really basically, you believe that there's a lot of lateral opportunities just beyond the CFE pipes which you can service off of your existing infrastructure. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yes. That and also \u2013 and eventually additional capacity through compression on a lot of the lines that we currently operate.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Got it. And then moving to the GRC settlement, the extension from Q1 to Q2. Is there anything to read into that bonus depreciation, extension, et cetera? Do you feel comfortable with the settlement at this point? Or any thoughts on that?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean we feel comfortable, but we're going to get a decision, proposed decision in the March timeframe. I mean that's what we're looking at. And the issue of bonus depreciation was part of the litigation in the record of the rate case and the settlement was made understanding that there was some potential for extension of that. So we think that the settlement is \u2013 we think it's likely to get adopted. And we think that we should have a decision hopefully sometime in the second quarter.", "Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. So just following up a little bit more on the Aliso conversation, can you elaborate a little bit more on thoughts on next steps just both from a regulatory process? But perhaps, more importantly from an operational perspective, how do you think about getting the asset back in the service? And then also, how do you think about your own investment plan in light of what may be required out of that regulatory process, and or working around any limitations on the Aliso Canyon asset itself?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, let me just take a comment on that and then I'm going to refer to Dennis on coming back into operation. I think one thing that's quite positive is that when we filed our rate case we had actually filed for a program that would do internal inspections of wells and some of the things that has now happened on pipelines. And we filed for a program that would do that for storage facilities. And that in the rate case settlement, we ended up with two-way balancing account that would allow us to make those kinds of investments to do the review of the storage wells and go through them on a programmed planned kind of a basis, which is what we had proposed. But getting that all in place now and getting the facility operational for injection season, we've been spending a lot of time looking at how we use that program, which is basically aligned with what the Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR has kind of outlined as well. So Dennis why don't you kind of talk about what we're doing now with Aliso and all of our storage facilities there.", "Dennis V. Arriola - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Southern California Gas Co.", "Good morning, Julien. Let me start with Aliso and it's kind of really a two-pronged approach. First is, we're, obviously, as Debbie mentioned, we're cooperating with the investigation that's being led by DOGGR and the CPUC and they have an independent expert on the outside, a company call Blade Energy Partners. And so we're supporting them and they're really driving the time schedule there. So whatever time it takes for them to do their work and to issue the report, will kind of take its own path. But as far as getting the field back into service, as I mentioned DOGGR has issued its comprehensive safety review that we're working with them on. And it's very detailed process of testing, inspecting if necessary repairs.", "And as Debbie mentioned, it really does, it's very parallels, what we had put in place as far as our SIMP program and what we're doing from a pilot standpoint. So, we're working to expeditiously implement that. It's hard to tell at this point in time how long it will take us to get through all of the 115 wells. But the way that the program is put together, it does allow us once we've accomplished a minimum threshold of tests on all the wells, we can start bringing some of the wells on. We don't have to do complete work on a 100% of those. We can isolate or abandon certain wells and bring on the other wells at the same time.", "So, we'll be giving further updates on that down the road, but I think the key points there is, again, policy makers, the regulators and we're very closely working with all of these. So that they understand what could happen, both here in the summer from electric reliability standpoint and from a gas standpoint. We're all really working together to make sure that Aliso and all of our gas storage facilities are safe and reliable. And they can service our customers.", "We're also \u2013 there also is an emergency regulation that was put in place by DOGGR, is that applies to all gas storage facilities, not just Aliso. And so we're complying with that as well. And that includes things such as daily pressure reads, testing the wellhead valves, and some other procedures that have to be put in place. So there's a lot going on, we've got a people at all of our facilities. And we're focused on again doing this as expeditiously and as safely as possible.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, excellent. And just quickly following up on one of the last questions, with respect to the decision to move from an MoU to just an outright contract. Let me just be very clear about this. Your confidence level is higher incrementally or you said, obviously less ideal market backdrop, but moving in that step, I would presume to be a statement of comfort that indeed this is moving forward. But I don't want to put words in your mouth either.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean there is no question that the market is tougher than it was when we signed Cameron 1 through 3. But Oct\u00e1vio has been negotiating with some very strong counterparties and they want to go to sales and purchase agreement, we want to go to sales and purchase agreement. That would allow us more comfort in starting to spend money on the facility, because it kind of lays out all the terms and as long as long you meet those terms, then they are obligated. And an MoU doesn't have that same level of obligation.", "So, I think getting these sales and purchase agreement signed, would give us a lot of confidence and being able to move forward with the facility later this year. Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to add anything to that?", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - President, Sempra LNG Corp", "No, I think that we're pretty much as Debbie indicated, it's good that we're moving in this direction, obviously the counterparties are using resources that are expensive, whether it's a law firms or their internal resources. So there's interest involved in this. As you know this is a facility that's not selling into the current market, it's a facility that's going to sell into market 2020 plus. And it's going to be one of the lowest, if not the lowest facility at that point in time to deliver LNG to a time where just about anyone agrees, there is going to be a shortage of supply.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Citi's Faisel Khan has our next question.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, good afternoon.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, Just the decision to expense some of the LNG development expenses, was that for Port Arthur or was that for Cameron's trains 4 and 5?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Most of the \u2013 the majority of the $20 million to $25 million is for Port Arthur and it's to do the work that's necessary to design enough of the facility where you can price it so you can market it. And that is engineering and legal cost and all. And then legal cost associated with the sales and purchases agreements for Cameron, and then the related facilities, the pipelines and storage and all of that integrate with that. That's what's most of the costs are. And they're expensed because those are the accounting rules, once we get contracts signed, then we would expect that this expense to not be part of our ongoing guidance, because we'll spend the funds once. And once we get contract signed then we will begin capitalization of the substantial part of the project costs.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, got you. And then in terms of as you enter into these negotiations for train 4, what are the hurdle rates you're looking at in terms of a return on capital for the project? Is it similar to the IRRs you were talking about with the Mexico pipeline that are 9% or is it higher? How do you guys look at the returns?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't share that, because we're still negotiating with customers. But we always look at what our cost of capital is on a risk adjusted basis. And that we would have a reasonable return for that. So I mean, that's the way we would be looking at it, and our returns tend to be in the high-single digits, low-double digits for most of our projects so.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then could you remind us on the pipelines in Mexico, the tariffs are in dollar denominated terms. Is that correct, or am I or some of them in peso terms?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "In Mexico, our tariffs are in dollars, but we pay taxes in pesos. And so that's why we have the FX issue in Mexico, which usually has recently as always been in our favor in Mexico.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So it just happens to be a coincidence that the tax benefit in Mexico offsets the currency depreciation in Chile and Peru?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "It's a little more than a coincidence. There usually a some relation to currency valuations around the world, but it has been more of a one-for-one offset in the past, it has disconnected a little bit as we've moved forward.", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Faisel, this is Joe, I'll just add on to Mark's comment. The FX benefit in Mexico, doesn't have to do with the tariffs, because all of these dollar denominated contracts and our dollar denominated business is really the functional currency and that's how we operate in Mexico, but we have to pay our taxes in pesos. And the Mexican tax rules require that we have FX adjustments related to our monetary assets and then taking into account inflation. And so, as these currencies kind of move in a similar direction against the U.S. dollar, we get this natural hedge, natural offset.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, I think that makes sense. And then when you talk about your guidance though for 2016, you're talking about a further depreciation in some of these currencies, or are you just looking at the forward rates? I just wanted to make sure I understood that language.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Joe, why don't you kind of walk through that?", "Joseph A. Householder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, let me walk through that Faisel, because I think this is important for everybody to understand and we talk about it from time-to-time. But we have some really, really well run utilities in South America, and over time, those have done extremely well and you can look back to the early 2000s. They've done very well over time and we like those assets a lot. But they are local currency run companies and their revenues are in local currency. And so, we've seen a depreciation against the U.S. dollar because we have to translate those into dollars of about 15% to 20%, since last year's plan.", "So when we did the 2016 plan last year and showed you a number, those currencies have depreciated 15% to 20%, and there's to some degree, some offset in our tariffs and they catch up over time because we have adjustments in our tariffs. But we've adjusted the revenues or the net earnings from those companies for that change in FX rates from a year ago to the ones we have now. In Mexico, the tax expense I was just referring to a moment ago that's an annual adjustment kind of it goes from what was the peso at the beginning of the year to what it's going to be at the end of the year. And I think Debbie mentioned in her remarks that we haven't had this in our planning in the past. And the reason is we're not allowed to under accounting \u2013 GAAP accounting rules, we're not allowed to kind of forecast that.", "So, with this year, we put it in the plan because we know that the Mexican pesos forecasted to move about 3.5%. And so, we forecasted a change in our tax expense for that 3.5%. And so in 2016, we see a little bit of loss there. In 2015, we actually had earnings as a result of this. We had $31 million increase at Mexico and a $20 million decrease in South America, so we had $11 million plus. So again in 2013-2014, it was neutral and between 2015 and 2016 that is going to be kind of neutral. These things don't move the needle very much for us. They're pretty small.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's very clear and I appreciate that. Last question for me. On the Renewables segment, just \u2013 and this is a small number, but if I look at the topline revenues in your Table F (52:19) sort of year-over-year, they are down. I'm just trying to understand why. I know that there's a lot of stuff below the line including tax and gains on asset sale and stuff like that they tend to move the needle \u2013 tend to move the earnings. But on the top line, I would suspect that that number would be relatively stable. So I'm just trying to understand why it would be down year-over-year.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'm going to have Trevor go through that.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller", "Sure. Faisel, what's really happening there is some of that is really the assets that have been dropped into the joint venture structures. And so there is certain assets that we owned a 100% in 2014 that are now owned 50% and then are picked up through the equity method of accounting.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. It makes sense. Thanks guys for the time. I appreciate it.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Faisel.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. One question on LNG, and less about your contracting and maybe more about just the broader LNG markets. I mean if you read the stuff that comes out of a lot of the economic consulting firms or other folks, they tend to talk about how the LNG market is oversupplied. And so that would imply that it would be a headwind for any new LNG development. And yet it seems with some of the things you talk about at Cameron 4 and Port Arthur that your views and your actions and potential growth are contrary to that. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about the global LNG market, what you see for the near term and what you see for the long term?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I'm going to ask Oct\u00e1vio to answer that, but what I want to ask \u2013 to raise to you, is a lot of this is a about timeframe, and that what you read about is the current LNG market is seen as being oversupplied. What you also read about is that beginning in the 2020 period, and beyond there is a need in the marketplace for more LNG. So, now part of it is the timing of these things. So, if you were having a non-contracted project coming on today, that might be a real challenge. If you have a project coming on, when there is a market need, and that market need grows over time, then that's a very different market that you're going after. So, Oct\u00e1vio, why don't talk about the broad market and then how we feel that our facilities are going to compete in that market?", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - President, Sempra LNG Corp", "Again, a bit of (54:51) introduction to the timeframe issue. The one thing that we need to start looking at is the current market is oversupplied as you indicated, no discussion about that, but we also have a little problem with the current market. We have an oversupplied market and yet the spot cargoes are more expensive than the long-term pricing, which was agreed in the tight market. So market is broken in its pricing formulas, and the market is adjusting to it as we speak and will adjust for the next couple of years.", "But our focus is not the current market. Our focus is 2020 as I've indicated, where you'll see that the current oversupply would we absorbed and then there is a shortage and unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your point of view, these facilities take five years, six years to come online once you decide to go forward. And as a result, we need to make decisions today to meet that demand. It is difficult to make. It's large capital investments when a lot of the big players are taking write-downs because of oil, that's the condition why the market is tough. Some of the buyers are confused by the oversupply, but our focus is not the current market.", "So globally, unless you believe we're going to switch everything from gas to coal and oil which would increase our carbon footprint significantly and it seems like the winds are the other way around, if you do believe that we are going forward, not only with a continuous economic growth, but with a change to a lower carbon footprint, then gas is going to play a role not just in the current markets but in other markets that are yet to open.", "One interesting statistics I heard this week at CERA Week was the fact that the lower demand from Korea and Japan was made up by increased demand in Middle East countries and therefore the demand didn't go away, and that was not there in the earlier projection. So globally, where our projects fit? We're comfortable. It is a tough market for people to make decisions when they're under significant pressure. But we think, we are offering to the market the lowest cost producing facility for 2020, and that's why the interest is there.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And I remember at one of your investor meetings, you outlined where your facilities, I think it was your last Analyst Day. You outlined where your facilities sit on a cost curve relative to other global LNG facilities. Just curious, given the fact that Port Arthur is greenfield and Cameron was brownfield, the thing that surprised us back then and still does a little bit now is that they are so close to each other on that dispatch curve in compared to some of the others. How are you thinking about, how the economics of Port Arthur as a greenfield would differ from some of the disclosures you've given previously on Cameron 1 through 3?", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - President, Sempra LNG Corp", "That's a very good question and I'll be happy to bring up another topic that sometimes gets forgotten. In the economics of the \u2013 pardon me, in the Cameron based project we included $1 billion of the cost of the existing facilities which is essentially replacement value. So the economics of Cameron in that chart you saw at Analyst Day, as well as all the other charts included the value of existing facilities. And so what we're doing with Woodside and Port Arthur is looking at ways to break some of the paradigms in the industry, keep it as safe and reliable as we want it to be as the customers expect it to be, but look at ways to reduce cost.", "Just like we found when we did Cameron, that we had the lower cost per ton for conventional technology of liquefaction. We have an even lower price for the expansion of Cameron for trains 4 and 5 and we expect to achieve similar results with Port Arthur. If we don't find that we can do that then, Port Arthur is not going to go away. We simply believe that the industry has to be going back to a discipline of developing the next lowest marginal cost available of supply in order to be sustainable.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you Oct\u00e1vio, much appreciated.", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - President, Sempra LNG Corp", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management.", "Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP", "Hi this is Ashar, how are you guys doing?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Ashar.", "Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP", "Debbie, I just wanted to \u2013 there's a little bit of confusion, a lot of calls going on today. But if I'm correct, I heard you say in your prepared remarks, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the goal is still to meet or exceed previous expectations set. Is that correct?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not sure what expectations you're referring to. What we're very focused on is that the growth that we have outlined for you in our plans is long-term contracted growth or in our utility. And that what we put in our base plan is things that we already have under contract and then expected utility performance. What we expect to do is over the next five years, we expect to add projects to that. And this last year alone, we added 325 megawatts of renewables that will come online late this year. We've added or will be adding when the transaction closes the PEMEX acquisition and that was not part of our base plan a year ago.", "So, our expectations are that we're not going to sit still, we're going to continue to develop and grow our business. And that what we show you though in terms of our growth is and when we get to our Analyst Conference, we will do what we always do which is the blue box and the green box. That shows you what we have contracted and what's basically in our utilities as projects approved or in our rate case. And then we show you what we're working on that could add to that growth over the five-year period of time and we'll be doing the same thing for you this year.", "Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go to Morningstar's Mark Barnett next.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Thanks for all the comments on the LNG market today. I did want to ask one more question about Mexico. And I know that some of the pressure on PEMEX does create an opportunity in the \u2013 some of the assets they might be looking to offload. But I'm wondering if you know, you see beyond maybe this current slate of projects some headwinds just from the lower oil revenues from the Mexican government, and maybe if you could talk about how you see that balance of opportunity versus challenge?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I mean honestly, when you talk to our CEO in Mexico, he sees it as an opportunity, because the whole reason for a reform was to bring capital into Mexico to build the kind of infrastructure that they need for the kind of growth. And you have to realize, Mexico is going to be more competitive, the lower the energy prices are in the long term for them, that has been kind of their stumbling block on being globally competitive.", "So to the degree that they can use other party's capital and that would be us, I mean, we'd like to put our capital there and as if they can build the infrastructure that reduces their energy cost that they're moving forward on that basis. And so we think that, I think it's a struggle for PEMEX, with having being reliant on oil revenues, but it's an opportunity for us to come in and build things that wouldn't otherwise be built and that are needed as part of their long term Mexican infrastructure. So, that's kind of the way we look at it. Mark do you want to?", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Yeah, I would just \u2013 let me just add to that too. I think that the \u2013 when we talk about energy reforms in Mexico, I think a lot of folks are focused on the reforms at PEMEX and they haven't seen increases in production and some of the things that they expected to see from energy reform and I think that's entirely the fault of $30 oil, and very little to do with the reforms, what are coming out of the reforms is a massive amount of energy infrastructure within the company, within the country and that infrastructure is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, as Debbie said, it's lowering energy costs, bringing natural gas in the regions of the country that didn't have access to it before, it's making \u2013 it's really making a big difference on lowering electricity costs across the country, and that's working very, very well.", "And to the extent that low gas or low oil prices are hindering some of the reforms at PEMEX, I think that again is creating a large opportunity for us, because it increases the need for PEMEX for capital. It gives opportunities for us to look at the assets that they are going to be putting up for sale. And so, from our perspective, I think we think that the reforms are working very much as intended, and that we will continue to benefit as being one of the best placed companies in the country to take advantage of those opportunities.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Okay. And with the latest round of bids, I apologize if I missed it in your comments. I mean you gave the bid dates, do you have an estimate for when you might expect the results from the bidding process?", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "They were looking at \u2013 they haven't given any specific dates, but probably in the March and April timeframe, is most likely.", "Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research", "Okay. Right. That's all from me. Thanks a lot.", "Mark A. Snell - President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Debbie Reed for closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks again, for all of you joining us today, and all of your excellent questions. We hope to see you at our Analyst Conference on May 24. And if you have any follow-up questions, our Investor Relations team is available to answer anything that was left off from the call today.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section.", "With me in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E; and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to indicate that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 2, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Rick. During the third quarter, our strong operating and financial performance continued across the company. Our third quarter financial results keep us on track to achieve our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share.", "I would like to start off with an update on Cameron LNG. Last week, Cameron JV's EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay would likely cause 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further details in a moment.", "Moving on to other important elements of our base plan, I'm pleased to say that since our Analyst Conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our projects. At IEnova, we have closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity.", "At the California utilities, we continue to make progress on our $12 billion five-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPUC has approved the Sycamore-Pe\u00f1asquitos electric transmission project at SDG&E. We've also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value propositions.", "At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017.", "Now, please turn to slide 5. Let me start with an update on Cameron Trains 1 through 3. Last week, Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor, that the in-service date for each train may be facing delay. The contractor's information reflects updated in-service dates as follows: mid-2018 for Train 1; late-2018 for Train 2; and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information and ways to mitigate any impact.", "We are disappointed with the short-term delay, because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on time and on budget. But under a lump-sum turnkey construction agreement, the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is that EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact to Cameron's customers.", "As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. The terms of our agreements provide that EPC schedule delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings.", "We had originally anticipated all three trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project when all three trains are in service in 2019 are approximately $80 million.", "Moving to Cameron Train 4. Any expansion of Cameron beyond the first three trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approvals, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well positioned as one of the lowest-cost sources of global LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions had never been part of our base plan.", "Now, please turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based long-term contracts consistent with Sempra strategy. They enhance Sempra's Mexico's value of proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base.", "IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last two years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova stock and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal showing is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico.", "In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252-megawatt Ventika wind facility. Ventika went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019. We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunities in Mexico that fit our strategy.", "Now, please turn to slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru Pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached, but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time.", "Moving on to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year-end. Regarding the root cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy.", "Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the LA County District Attorney's Office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine and penalty and enhancements to safety and methane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval.", "Also, if you'll recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage was over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to-date.", "The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primary related to updated cost estimates for the third-party root cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program. Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated cost and our insurance coverage.", "Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March of 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra.", "We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop an experienced and diverse leadership team. We strive to identify talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business.", "With that, I will hand it over to Joe for his last time as CFO to review the quarterly financial results, starting on slide 8.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million, or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $248 million, or $0.99 per share.", "This quarter, we have three adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the GdC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest.", "Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed the sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TdM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million non-cash charge at Sempra Mexico. All three of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance.", "I'd like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation, resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for the nine months that had no impact on third quarter results.", "Please turn to slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At the California utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses.", "Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactional effects, and inflation in the current year, compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015. This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru.", "I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter, but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings Section.", "I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based on our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share.", "Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had a strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was ordered at SDG&E and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the five years of our base plan.", "With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. So, quick question, following up on the LNG piece first. Can you elaborate a little bit of what the impact is to 2020? Just \u2013 if you suggest that the NPV remains the same, does that mean the tariff is actually adjusting up the NPV for you? And so, what does that mean for EPS? And then secondly, can you elaborate a little bit on the nature of the delay?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Let me try to just give a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they gave us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated were the three trains that I went over in the prepared remarks that that will be Train 1, mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; and Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cause of the delay, but on their call, they indicated that there has been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they have some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility.", "In terms of 2020, we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so, we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication as kind of the economics of the three trains \u2013 of all three trains that are operating. And what this delay would be, because we had said previously we expected all three trains to be in service by the end of 2018. So, I think with what we've given you, you could kind of calculate what you would anticipate.", "In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that when we signed the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up, what the capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so, that will occur.", "And then, so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project as we would have, had it gone in service on the originally planned day. And the toll actually goes up in future years as the way that it's calculated. But this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings, as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear, Julien. Was that helpful?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Absolutely. Thank you. And then just quickly, if you can actually, on the Peru piece. I know you don't want to comment too much, but what is the nature of the, I think, \"significant issues\" that you're resolving?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, that mean, there's commercial issues that are in the final stages of resolution. And then, we will have a number of conditions precedent if we can reach conclusion of the commercial issues in order to be sure that we have done the kind of diligence we want on the assets. And so, I would not at all say that this is near a done deal, but we're working on it. There's still meetings going on. And so, we're hopeful but we're also cautious.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Absolutely. Thank you very much.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Just to clarify your answer to Julien on the IRR, so it doesn't sound like it would have a material accretive impact on any one given year, given that you probably \u2013 one presumption would be that you just have an increase in the levelized toll over the course of the life of the contract in order to get back to your IRR. Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "That's a fair way to think about it. And then when you calculate the NPV with the delay or without the delay, it ends up being basically the same number, close to the same number. And so, that's exactly what happened. So, it increase earnings in future years as a result of a delay. And the same thing happens if there's an increase in project costs then the toll gets adjusted.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. At what point would you be in a position to start to get liquidated damages? Are you implying that a six-month delay does not tip you into that zone in the contract, but a further delay would?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Liquidated damages would apply depending on what the source of the delay is. And that's one of the things that is going to be a subject for discussion. As I said, we just got this notice last week. And the partners have not had the opportunity to sit down with CB&I and Chiyoda, and really understand what is the source of the delays, what can be done to mitigate some of those delays. None of those discussions have occurred since this notice came last week.", "Those will be occurring in the next several weeks. I will say many of us visited the site last week. Construction is progressing and that there's a lot of work that's been done on the site, but until we really sit down and understand what's driving some of the schedule changes, it's too early to speculate what the liquidated damages would be. But the contractor does have delay liquidated damages as part of their contract. And those go against capital cost for the project in reducing capital cost, so that's the way it works.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Got you. What was your peso exposure before and what is it now?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I'm going to have Joe address that in terms of the change with the \u2013 I think you're talking about looking at the change now with the acquisition of the...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "In other words, before the deal, what was your exposure to a given change in the exchange rate and what is it now?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Hi, Greg. So, what we wanted to do here is make sure that everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously, can move. And so, we see some impact of that.", "Over the last number of years, it's generally been a pretty close push between what was happening if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening in Chile, Peru and Mexico kind of offset each other. What we've wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now, because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso-dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities.", "It's hard to predict because, obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar-peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive, a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this.", "Just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So, if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact, but we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item that moves up and down and that would be costly to do.", "So, I can't give you a precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is, we've been saying for the past five years or so, that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar. Now, it'll be a little bit more tilted to Mexico. It can move up and it can move down and it will. And so, there'll be a little bit more exposure, but again, it's a non-cash exposure.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Got you. Final question. Can you give us what the earnings impact is of the renewable energy projects on page 6 that you won are relative to the base case that you gave out at Analyst Day?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No. We don't \u2013 I mean, we don't give project-by-project earnings. What we'll do is when we give you our updates on the February call for 2017, and then we give you our update at the Analyst Conference for 2018, we'll give you that information as part of our adjusted projection. So, we don't do them by projects. But they're the same. What I would say is, our renewable projects are all like high single-digit returns and that, this is about 400 megawatts in total of the adds that will come in over the next three years or so.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "When you say returns, you're meaning return on equity, IRR? How should \u2013 something like that?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Non-levered IRR. Yeah.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning. Sticking with Cameron Trains 1 through 3 for a second. I just wanted to understand maybe some context with other larger projects that you guys have done in the past and any issues that you might have had there? When you see something like this kind of get announced by the contractor this early in the process and taking the consideration that you have built in kind of time and cost contingencies into the overall package so far, where do we shake out here, is this the contractor being especially conservative and maybe there's a chance down the road that they get back on schedule or is this kind of a sign of something even worse to come?", "And then just a point of clarification as well on the kind of NPV staying whole, are you guys being made whole for that if the contractor is not responsible then just I guess, mathematically, it would be the counter-parties that are absorbing all of that potential risk, if that's correct?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Okay. Let me try to address \u2013 I think there were multiple questions in there, so let me try to address those. If you look at the delay notice, like I said, we just got it last week. We have not had the opportunity to sit down with the contractor and discuss, we'll be doing that within the next week or so. What I will say, though, is that the project is about 57% complete in total. And all the materials are on site for the construction. We were there last week. All of the cooling units were on Train 1. I mean, there's been a lot of construction progress and so it's not like early \u2013 not really early on, I would say, in the progress of the project. And it's the contractors' responsibility when they feel that there is a potential for a delay to give us those notifications and that's what they did just last week.", "As I said, all we know is that on their call, they said that there was rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that caused some flooding. We don't know what the actual cause of the delay is, until we get in and have a chance to have them explain to us what they're looking at, and then look at what the potential is to mitigate some of those. It's really hard for us to assess the likelihood of it getting better through those discussions, but we'll be making every effort to have that occur.", "I'm not sure if I answered all of your questions with that. I think there was one other thing that I might have missed, but...", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "About the NPV...", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "NPV.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "...if it's not the contractor, does it go to a customer?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. And it does go through the toll to the customers. And that was the agreement that was established, that all of the LDs (28:08) would go against the capital cost which would also reduce the toll to the customer. So, to the extent there's a delay that's caused by the contractor, the customers benefit from that in a reduced toll, because it reduces capital cost, but to the extent that there's a delay and that that increases the toll.", "And that's the way we designed it. Everyone was full knowledge. I mean, part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for Sempra in terms of the long-term value of this project. And so, we set it up to where we were not the ones that bore the risk for these things. And that the NPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor has responsibility for delay. And the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract. The only way that they can increase cost is by change orders.", "So, that was the design of the project, to really mitigate the risk long-term to our shareholders. And I think it's showing that it's pretty effective in doing that in the long-term, while it may affect some of the shorter term.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "I think it's important, too, to have perspective about over four-year construction project starting when we took up ID (29:25) in 2014 and going through now. And this is moving from their information to us, a fairly small amount in terms of that, but we wanted you to all understand what the impact could be to some of the earnings numbers that we've given you, because even though it's a small percentage on the construction timeline, we wanted everybody to see the visibility to that.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that extra clarity there. That's helpful to hear. And then just on the Peruvian project, I understand that you can't give us much in the way of detail around the negotiations right now or kind of maybe the timing of that specifically. But were you to be successful, would this require Sempra level equity and what would that mean in terms of the current plan to end the repatriation of cash at the end of, I think, 2018?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "All I can tell you on that is, those are all things we're looking at right now and looking what the alternatives are. And that, until we know if we have the project and we know what it would cost and we know what the cash flows are going to be on it, it's really difficult to give any speculation. I'm not going to speculate on that.", "When we update our numbers, you'll see some of that. And we will \u2013 if we get the project, then our numbers will be updated when we do the call on the Analyst Conference.", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And that was something where previously when you were negotiating for that a couple of years ago, you hadn't given any numbers out at that time either?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. And, no, we haven't given any numbers. We don't give numbers if we don't \u2013 until we know we have something, until we know how we're going to finance it, and that we have some confidence in the numbers. So...", "Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's clear. Thanks, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Stephen.", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Most of my questions have been hit on. I just wanted to discuss Aliso Canyon. You've given an updated insurance range. I wondered if you could just talk at a high level as to what caused the adjustment to that range. And then, sort of related, when you look at all the claims, how are you generally feeling in terms of ability of your insurance to cover those claims?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. We're still feeling good about our insurance ability to cover the claims. And when we looked at \u2013 we looked at our reserve on an ongoing basis, based upon new knowledge of cost. One of the key things that caused our estimate to go up is the work that's being done on the root cause analysis and the fact that the third parties that are doing work on that are expecting a delay. And with the expectation of a delay in getting the outcome there, we would expect the cost to be slightly higher. And so, we took that into account.", "And then the other thing is, we're going through now recovery with our insurance on all the relocation expense, and validating all of the claims, so we have full insurance recoverability. And that \u2013 and going through that, that has taken a lot more detail type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the two drivers for the change in cost.", "I will say, these costs will be updated over time though, as we get into litigation, as we get into \u2013 knowing what legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties on any of the potential claims, fines or penalties, or other claims.", "As an example on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the LA County DA, District Attorney, on the criminal charges and reached a settlement on that. And so, once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve number that we give you. So, those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve.", "We've also spent, though, time looking at our insurance. And looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is and being able to refine that a bit. And so, we're able to give you kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available.", "Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. I just want to understand with the delay in Trains 1 through 3, does that affect the marketing at all of Train 4?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Not directly, but I think indirectly in that, in order to go forward with Train 4, we need a few things. We need our partner consent. And as I said, we're working with one of the partners to try to get their consent. They've decided to not put equity in. And so, we're trying to look at how we would structure to move forward without them contributing equity, and have been having numerous ongoing discussions and communications with them about trying to resolve that.", "The other thing is, we need lenders' consent to move forward with Train 4. And the lenders are going to want to see that we've made reasonable progress on Trains 1 through 3, before giving that. So, that would be how I would see it having some impact, but it's not a direct impact.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And then, on the renewable projects in Mexico. I'm just trying to understand at a high-level, just trying to understand the potential growth in the renewables business within Mexico. Is the transmission system within the country well-developed enough to sort of handle all this wind and some of these solar projects coming online? I'm just trying to understand if these megawatts make it to market or are we getting too far ahead of ourselves before the transmission's developed?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Actually, that was one of the things that we looked at very carefully when we looked at \u2013 the one we acquired is already in operation. So, the transmission is there. And the two projects that we bid on, the solar projects that we won, we looked very carefully at what the transmission was, and we were very selective on what we bid based upon that. But there's great opportunity in transmission in Mexico. They're expecting two bids to be out within the next \u2013 in 2017 that would each be about $1.2 billion for transmission upgrades to their system. And that's a great opportunity for IEnova to participate in those bids.", "I think you will see a lot more. As you've seen in other markets where renewables start getting integrated, I think you will see a lot more investment in electric transmission occurring in Mexico. But, in the near-term, they've already announced those two bids.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got you. And then you guys' decision to participate in the equity offering, the amount that you guys decided to take down the equity offering, was there some calculus behind that in terms of how you came to that amount?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I'm going to ask Joe to talk about that, because there was some \u2013 a lot of thought about where want it to be and where we want to position ourselves for now. But I'm going to ask Joe to address that.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Faisel. Yeah. We said last year when we announced the deal for the PEMEX JV that we would basically take two years of the dividend flows from IEnova to us, hold those in our Mexican holding company and reinvest that. And we said it would probably be in the $300 million to $350 million range.", "And Mark and I spend a lot of time with Carlos talking about how much we should take. We got a lot of advice from our IEnova investors of how you guys should maybe not do it, we want to own more. So, definitely there was a lot of demand for this equity which was great. The roadshow was very similar to the IPO. We got a lot of orders every day and it was a really amazing roadshow with the investors.", "At the end of the day, we wanted to make sure, because we really love these assets and this business that we maintained a strong ownership interest in it. And so, we kind of went to the max, because we were actually issuing more equity than we originally put on the table when we started the roadshow and upside to that amount. So, we did about the top end of what we said we were going to do.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And then just on Aliso, I mean, is it possible \u2013 can the in-service date or the return of the service of the storage facility, can that be before the root cause analysis is done or do we have to wait for that to get done? I'm just trying to understand if there's \u2013 if that can actually happen before there's a resolution.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes. It can happen before the root cause analysis is done. Let me have Dennis kind of walk you through what the process is that DOGGR and the CPUC will use over the next month or so. As we did make our filing yesterday to put the field back in service and for DOGGR and CPUC to do the certification that's required. So, Dennis, do you want to kind of walk...", "Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy", "Sure. Hi, Faisel. Yeah. When the new law SB 380 was put in place, it was put in \u2013 it was established independently of when the root cause analysis was going to be completed. There are basically two different tracks there that we've complied with everything that's required under \u2013 we believe, under SB 380 and that's why we made the filing yesterday.", "So, the process now is that DOGGR and the Public Utilities Commission are going to be reviewing all of the data and the information that we submitted. They're required under the law to hold a public hearing, which they have to give 15-day notice to. And we expect that sometime soon, they'll establish the date for that and they'll go through the process. But as Debbie mentioned, they are independent tracks all together, the root cause analysis, as well as the satisfaction of the comprehensive safety review that's laid out in SB 380.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. That makes sense. I just want to wish Mark well in his retirement in case I didn't get a chance...", "Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "...to talk to him before the next quarterly call.", "Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Okay.", "Operator", "We will go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Hi, Debbie. I know you don't have specifics on why the six-month delay, but could you maybe just \u2013 is there a way you can make us more comfortable that six months doesn't turn into 12 months or 18 months? Could you talk about that or less, but why should we be worried about it being more?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I mean, I think that if you look at where construction is now, a lot of the major pieces of construction have been done. And some of the issues that were the most critical that have more time sensitivity dealt with all the foundational work, and that's all been done.", "So, I mean, I think when you see the progress, and some of you will see the progress when you visit the facility, you'll get a sense that the work is moving forward, it's up to the contractor to give us their best estimates of the timeframe, and it's probably not in their interest to give us something that they don't feel like they're going to be able to meet. And so, at this point in time, we feel all we had is their estimate and that we have to have some credibility.", "I think our view is that there are some things that might be done that could actually shorten some of the timeframes. But we don't know what the issues are that were driving the delays. And so, that's one of the things that we need to spend some time on. And so, I'd love to give you comfort, but until we get through some of those discussions with the contractor, I don't think it's a thing that I should be doing.", "I think we need to go through those discussions, have those discussions, understand the delay, look at the mitigation plans to the extent possible to try to reduce delays, and then come up with what we really all feel is the correct information.", "And we did not want to not tell you about this, because we got this notification. We all know it also puts us in a difficult position because we feel that we can work some of this, but we haven't had the time to do that yet.

Reed - Sempra Energy", "I don't know, Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to add anything to that?", "Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp", "No.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Okay.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "And just one other clarification on Cameron is the \u2013 are weather conditions and flooding and things like that something that would be kind of like a force majeure on a timing or no?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Not just weather conditions, no. There are certain provisions of the contract that are very well-defined as what constitutes the force majeure. And just having rain and bad weather would not be a force majeure.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Great. Switching gears just to detail clarifications. The $34 million of stock-based comp change, is that pre-tax or after-tax? And would you still be in your range for this year if that did not happen?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Let's have Trevor talk about it.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, Steve, this is Trevor. That's a tax item, so it's really an after-tax adjustment.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then would you still be in your range this year if that had not happened?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yes. Yes, we would.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then just on the PEMEX currency volatility, should we assume that it's still kind of goes the same way as in the past, i.e., if the peso weakens, it tends to be a benefit; and if the peso strengthens, it tends to be a hurt, or is that also unpredictable?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Steve, this is Joe. Yeah. I would say generally that is correct. Because it measures deferred taxes and monetary assets and liabilities, it could swing around if we had cash positions or debt positions and the deferred taxes, of course, over time will move. So, I think, directionally, you have it right, it should be in the same direction.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. Couple of questions. First of all, your thoughts on U.S. renewable opportunities for Sempra. Just curious in terms of whether you still see significant opportunities at all or none for either contracted wind or contracted solar growth for U.S. Gas & Power?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "We see some great opportunities for growth in renewables. And we're working on several projects where we've secured kind of the rights and the contracts and that are in early stages of development. We have the ability to expand the Mesquite side. We have the ability to expand the Broken Bow Wind side. And so, we think that with all of the RPS standards that are coming across the country that there are some good growth opportunities for renewables.", "I will say that the returns on renewables have gone down over time. And so, what we look at is, we really have good projects that have decent returns on them, because otherwise we can invest our capital. And so, we always look at the allocation of our capital to the projects to give us the highest returns. And since we're not \u2013 renewable is just one of the things we do. We're not going to just go after building megawatts. We're going to go after building megawatts that give us good return on our capital.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, Debbie. One other question back to the U.S. utilities and sorry if I'm staying a little U.S. centric here. What's not in the CapEx guidance that you laid out at the Analyst Day this summer, but that could provide upside to U.S. utility rate base growth? I'm thinking things like Otay Mesa, which I don't think was in that guidance. But what else is kind of in there that when I think about the next three years to five years could lead to higher rate base than what you laid out in July?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, you actually named one. So, let me turn it to Jeff, and he can talk about SDG&E, and then Dennis can talk about SoCalGas, because there are a number of things that we're working on right now including the potential of a DC transmission line. So, Jeff?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Michael. We laid out at our Analyst Conference some of these green box items, which were not in the plan that could provide some additional upside. Now, just to give you a brief update, I mean one of the things I think we've done relatively successful is you've got to be able to manage both your GRC capital and the capital for projects which are proved outside the GRC.", "So, just recently, we've had, just to be sure, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved, that's not incremental to the plan, but that's outside the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest Project, Sycamore-PQ as well as the batteries which were discussed earlier on the call. So, we're making great progress there for our 2016, 2017 and 2018 capital plan, it was roughly $3.5 billion, $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and it's going forward. So, that really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan.", "In terms of things which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the DC line, this is the Southwest Power link which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity as we think about providing more reliability particularly into the LA Basin of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde, generating center in Arizona back into California, that's one project of about $1 billion.", "Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries. At San Diego Gas & Electric by the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility-owned batteries. And we think there's an incremental 200 megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which called for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split one-third between the three industrial and utilities.", "Otay Mesa you referenced, which is a 600 megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center, that is subject to a put-call arrangement with Calpine. And as you may recall, I think correctly from our last Analyst Conference that was not included in our five-year plan.", "And then the last thing I'd mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years, and almost 50% of that has to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territories.", "So, big picture on this greenhouse gas issue, Michael, is you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sits inside the State of California. Maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There's no question, if the state is serious about meeting its goals, we have to have a revolution around the transportation sector. And I think almost in every scenario, the California utilities will play big in that space.", "Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy", "Hey, Michael, this is Dennis Arriola. Let me just touch on three things real quick. One is, we expect that going forward, there's going to be new national or state rules or regulations on storage. And I think that that's an opportunity as we continue to enhance the overall infrastructure and the safety of all of our facilities. That's number one.", "The second, and we've touched on this a little bit but we're seeing more momentum here in the state, is focusing on using natural gas for heavy duty transportation, so the fueling infrastructure around that.", "And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So, we're not going to give out dollar amounts for those yet, but I think those are three areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Mark, congrats, and look forward to seeing you out fly fishing at some point.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just want to follow-up on the LNG just a little bit more. The joint venture contractors, can you just review the credit support and what you have with respect to their ability to \u2013 just their financial wherewithal to, their guarantees and what have you for the project?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Sure. I'm going to have \u2013 I can give a high level, but I'm going to have Joe or Mark address more details. We do have performance assurances with CB&I and Chiyoda; they have a joint and several guarantee from each of the parties and a letter of credit as a backstop. So, we have that. And I don't know if you guys want to add anything more to that. Okay.", "Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy", "We have \u2013 there's very strong credit support.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. I just wanted to review that. And then the \u2013 I mean, is it unusual for them to sort of call up and say, we've got a problem, but not tell you what the cause of the problem is?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "What they have to do is they have to lay out the detailed schedule of everything that they expect to happen like with the construction and the new detailed schedule. And we just go that, I think it was Friday of last week. And so, that's how they begin the discussion on this is that they lay out a new detailed schedule, and then the discussion comes around that new detailed schedule. So, as I said, we just got that Friday, I think it was of last week. And then, that will begin the discussions. So, I mean, that's kind of the process. They are the ones responsible for giving official notification. And that was the process that they followed.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then, the Train 4, the partner who dropped out, can you tell us a little bit more about which partner that is and why they dropped out?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No. But...", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "...I can just tell you why they've indicated that they don't want to do it. It's a company that's changed their strategy, and is really focused on some downstream more now and more clean green energy. And so, they are looking not to invest major portions of their capital in LNG, and that's what they indicated to us. It was a strategy change.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then, the accounting change, the $34 million stock compensation, what triggered that? What was the reason why that happened? And is there any impact past this year for 2017 or beyond?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. This is Trevor. That was as a result of an accounting standard update which was 2016-09 that we implemented and we early adopted this year. So, historically, what you've done is you've taken that tax benefit and it's gone straight to APIC or accumulated \u2013 or paid-in capital. Now, it's trying to simplify the accounting associated with that, and so you take that tax benefit and you push it through the P&L. So going forward, we'll treat it the same way.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Meaning going forward, will \u2013 I'm sorry to be slow, but what that does mean in terms of...", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. There'll be earnings going forward...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "...of similar amount. It won't always be the same, because it will depend on what restricted stock and other stock is vesting. Many other utilities have also adopted it this year.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So, that should be good for earnings going forward. Am I right?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "That's right.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then maybe in a similar amount.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, assuming \u2013 it could go...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, it can go either way.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, I don't want to give an \u2013 yeah, inference that you can add $34 million a year. That's not the way it works. So, why don't you discuss how it works.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. The way it works is \u2013 when the original grant is issued, that stock-based compensation is an expense. And you take that tax benefit. If it vests at a higher amount and the stock price increases, then there's more of a tax deduction in those future years. And so, historically, the stock price has been rising. And the grants have been vesting at the multiplier, meaning that there is a higher tax benefit in future years.", "That tax benefit has historically gone through adjusted trading (55:20) capital. And now, the accounting standard says, put it through the P&L. So, going forward, we anticipate, assuming that the stock price continues to rise, and that the multiplier effect is in place, like it has been in the past years, we would get a similar type benefit. If it doesn't, if the stock price were to go down and it still vests, it could actually have a decrement to earnings in the future, but that's just how it can go both ways.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "What if there was no change in the stock price?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Then there would be \u2013 then you would not have that tax benefit when those stocks vest because you take that tax benefit when you issue the grant over those periods.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the clarification. And congratulations to Mark.", "Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Hi. Good morning still.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Andy.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "On the letter of credit that you mentioned, how large is the letter of credit?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "You're talking about the Cameron letter of credit?", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "That's correct. How big is it?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "I don't know offhand. I don't remember offhand.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. We'll have to get back to you.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I don't remember offhand. We'll get it to you.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Is it hundreds of millions or $100 million or...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "No, no. We'll get back to you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "We'll get the information.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "I don't want to give you a bad number.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "We'll get the information.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "That's fine. And what triggers it?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "It would be a default.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Non-performance.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Non-performance, yeah.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "It's non-performance. Okay. And then, are there any, like, surety insurers like surety bonds or anything like that or nothing like that?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "No. No. This is \u2013 keep in mind this is a very, very large project. There's really not that much bonding capacity in the market.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "And one very large credit-worthy counterparties on the other side and a big joint venture.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Well, yeah. And keep in mind the \u2013 you're talking just about the contractor here.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Yeah.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "These are very large credit-worthy companies, and so it would be unusual to have that kind of a bonding capacity and a project that size.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I want to stress, as I said, that between CB&I and Chiyoda is a joint and several guarantee.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Right.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "So, they basically assume each other's responsibility, so...", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "And I don't \u2013 but I also think too there's no indication that they're not performing. But they have an obligation under the contract to tell us if they think there's going to be a delay. They've notified us of that, and we'll work through it to see if we can mitigate it. But they're not saying that they can't finish the job.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "And I know that you haven't spoken to them, but it's just based on your comments, it seems that the delay seems to be around the flooding, right, and all the rain that you had down there, is that correct? Is that kind of your plan?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "All we can say on that is that what they think, didn't give us any official notification and the information that they sent to us. So, when we listen to their earnings call, on the earnings call, they said that there was rain at the site and the site of their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge that caused some flooding, and that they expected some delays in construction. That's what they said on their call. You can listen to their call and get the precise language. I'm just kind of reiterating what they've said.", "But we don't have any official notification. And we will be meeting with them soon. It's something where all the partners have to sit down with them together. So, it's not something that you can do instantly because this is a joint venture. And so, it will be our self and our three partners sitting down with CB&I and Chiyoda. And I think it's scheduled within the next week or two for that meeting to occur.", "To really go through, as I said, they give us this massive package that has a detailed schedule that they produced on the construction. And someone asked me, what gives you some assurances, well, part of the whole effort is to go through that detailed schedule that they gave us and to ensure that everything has been given consideration. And that's the process they need to go through.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "Okay. The last question I have and I apologize if I'm not as familiar. I'm very familiar with CB&I. But Chiyoda, how are they \u2013 I guess what they're a separate company unrelated to CB&I or they're a subsidiary that does this type of work with them or what's the relationship?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "It is a huge multinational company that's not at all private CB&I other than through this joint venture. It's a Japanese-owned construction company. I don't know what their market cap is or but it's, yeah.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital", "I get it. Yeah. I'm not that smart. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Okay. Thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in the next few weeks.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter 2016 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website.", "With me in San Diego are Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Group President Utilities; Joe Householder, Group President of Infrastructure; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.", "I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 28, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Rick. On today's call, I will discuss several topics. Our 2016 achievements and update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend.", "This morning we reported full-year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items.", "The adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation, both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the north south pipeline.", "This net benefit largely offset the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes.", "We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance.", "At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flow gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividend and earnings growth.", "The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California utilities on slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas' authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively through 2019. In 2018, we will true-up long-term debt costs to actual debt costs at both are our California utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans.", "This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's Analyst Conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. CPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half this year.", "Moving to Aliso Canyon, SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues, we sealed the leak over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into two settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlement with South Coast AQMD and at the facility we've strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections.", "Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including resuming injections at (5:57), continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims. Turning to SONGS, the final decision in the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future.", "The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of their war between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement.", "By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement, or the CPUC will begin further proceedings. Two all-party meetings have been held. We maintain that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interests of the parties.", "Please turn to slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1-3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides weekly progress reports to Sempra and other owners. Since the owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward.", "Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and re-sequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service timeframes of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the Analyst Conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates.", "It is important to note that Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in two important ways. First, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and schedule risk to Cameron's contractor. Second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes.", "Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders, while reducing risk.", "Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico and later Jeff will discuss potential tax reform.", "The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance.", "IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming Analyst Conference.", "With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to slide 7.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. I have the good fortune of starting my new role on a positive note. We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Our new range is up from the previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20, provided at last year's Analyst Conference.", "Next, I'll briefly discuss the key drivers of our updated guidance. First, both SDG&E and IEnova had strong performance in 2016, and we expect the improved performance to continue.", "Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects. Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change.", "These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs at SDG&E and SoCalGas, that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan.", "Let's turn to slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full-year 2016 earnings were $1.370 billion or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1.349 billion or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share. This year you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into two groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix.", "Next I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first five items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our planned repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015.", "The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows; $9 million of net higher earnings at the California utilities, offset by $14 million lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American utilities.", "Next, let's please turn to slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high-level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact.", "It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986 and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo account established by our final 2016 GRC. Under that decision, you will recall, we're required to track the impacts of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending.", "When you consider the potential impact to our EPS five years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate non-deductibility of interest, and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt.", "In contrast, the high-end scenario has the same assumptions except Cameron qualifies for the border tax exemption and the non-deductibility of interest is confined to new debt only. We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in a range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we found this to be the most likely outcome.", "It's uncertain if there'll be any material change to our current tax laws, but if they are the impacts to our earnings profile to be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented.", "Next, please turn to slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Jeff. In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance, while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including finalizing the GRC at our California utilities and most recently reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension, closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the marine pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico.", "Selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Conference here in San Diego on April 4 and April 5 and talking more then about our future.", "Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life.", "With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I just wanted to be \u2013 a couple of questions. First is, I just wanted to make sure it's clear that you're going to assume Train 1 mid-2018, Train 2 end of 2018, Train 3 in mid-2019, when you give us the guidance in April, but you have not formally agreed to a change in the contract in terms of the delivery dates, is that right?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Let me hit the high level and then I'll have Joe talk a little bit about where we are on that. As we look at the schedule on the trains, the schedule that you laid out is the schedule that has been confirmed by the contractors, the schedule that they believe that they can deliver the trains on. And we've been doing a lot of due diligence work both with the Cameron JV and then some follow-up meetings that the Sempra team has had with the contractor.", "And so, when we give our guidance \u2013 assuming nothing changes between now and the time we give our future guidance, we will be using that estimate that the contractor has affirmed to us as their current estimate. In terms of contractually, we're still working through all of those issues, but we've basically been using that as the schedule for the trains.", "Joe, do you want to add?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. The concise answer to your question is no, we did not change the contract, but the contractor still has earlier dates in it. This is their working schedule that they're working with and the one they think is achievable.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So that's important for our understanding of the safeguards, right, that you're not giving \u2013 you're conceding that they won't owe you liquidated damages if they're late?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "We have not \u2013 that's correct, we've not. And as you might remember, our IRR pretty much stays intact, whether there is a change in cost or a change in schedule. The most important thing is our earnings are protected it's just a question really of what happens to the tariff with respect to the issue that (19:24).", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And then Jeff I had a question for you, you commented on a decision to not undertake tax repatriation from South America, because of the better growth prospects there. So not to jump the gun on the Analyst Day presentation, but is it safe to assume that we're going to see higher regulated capital expenditures in Chile and the Peru versus the prior plan as a result of that reassessment?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Greg, thanks a lot for your question. I mean I think one of the things I would say in response is we had our largest ever capital campaign last year of $5.3 billion, that was driven largely by our California utilities with $2.7 billion. But we are seeing a lot more deal flow outside of our regulated utilities, a lot of that showed up last year in Mexico. I think from a repatriation standpoint, we're really looking at whether we can put those earnings to work in a more efficient way there locally. And that currently is our assumption going into our planning period. So this is something we probably as you indicated, we'll give you a lot more visibility on in April.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay, great. And then can I ask you know I know \u2013 this is last question for me, the list of changes on page 9 from 2015 to 2016. As I think about what the old guidance was and how you did significantly better than old guidance on what you delivered in 2016, thank you for that. So what were the key changes that happened as you sort of got into the fourth quarter that moved you from the middle of the old guidance range to where you actually delivered?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I think...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I would assume, they were some of the tax changes in the repatriation and some of the order tax things.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes, so I mean those were the major things that occurred, there were, we tried to delineate pretty much everything that was happening for the quarter and for the year. So you could get a good picture of it. And I think that the major issues were some of the tax things and then there was a change in the accounting methodology for stock-based compensation and that also had an effect for last year's results.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning. One other clarification on Cameron, when you last talked about this, the contractors never had told you why there was a delay. So, have they clarified to you why the delay in the schedule?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes. I mean, what they've claimed is that much of the delay was due to weather conditions and as we've all known that there has been a lot of rain that's occurred. What I'd like to do though, was \u2013 Joe actually met with the principals of the CB&I yesterday with the lead director on our board for our \u2013 actually the chair of our LNG construction committee, and he is the prior CEO of Fluor. And so they both went and met with the principals of CB&I yesterday, and I thought \u2013 I think it might be helpful to add a little bit more color on what came from that meeting. Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. These are complex projects. There's thousands \u2013 there's over 20,000 line items of things that they're working on. So there's lots of things that go on in the project. Certainly weather is a factor among other things. One of the things that we spoke about yesterday when we talked about their confidence in meeting the working schedule is, they're making sure that logistically they're doing things in the best way possible. So, for example, they were talking about how they're going to move pieces of equipment directly to locations, reducing the use of cranes. There's so many different things, it's hard to characterize and pin anything on one particular item, because there are so many. But we had a good meeting with them yesterday and spoke about a number of issues. Again, remember that the Cameron joint venture is, the one in-charge of the contract with them and working with them on a daily basis and our director and I were there to basically do due diligence for Sempra to understand where they were and their confidence level in moving along and keeping to the working schedule and keeping that on track.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Want to \u2013 maybe just a little bit of a logistical question for the Analyst Day. Is your intention to still do the same kind of year-ahead outlook and then five-year outlook, as you've always done?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Our intention is to give the 2018 numbers and then to give a growth rate through 2021, consistent with...", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "...ahead of our past practice.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And just at a high level and again I'm not sure this is fully possible right now, but just you mentioned like the repatriation changes, you have the updated schedule for Cameron, but is there any kind of things that we should just be kind of noting that have changed a lot versus the long-term outlook given then?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I think those are the things you named are the most significant things and we'll give you the details of that when we get to the Analyst Conference with laying out our 2018 numbers and then what has changed from when we last forecast 2018, which was several years ago. So, one thing as an example when we last forecast 2018, we still were forecasting REX in it.", "So, I mean I think most of those things you know about and I don't think that there is anything that I'm aware of that you probably don't already know about, but how it all comes together we'll share with you when we get to the Analyst Meeting.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. And I guess last question just on Mexico, you talked very briefly on it, but just maybe a little bit more color on how you're looking at the kind of political economic implications of the new administration and the like, and just maybe a little more color on, is it impacting future bids or kind of strategy around IEnova.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No. We really haven't seen anything impacting our business in Mexico. We see amazing growth opportunities in Mexico, and what we see there happening is that the markets that are opening are creating additional opportunities for us. We see some electric transmission bids coming, renewables is a big focus, they've set a renewable portfolio standard. Those bids we see going forward and then we're really interested in some opportunities we see with liquids pipelines and receiving terminals.", "And so, we see that business continuing to move forward and in discussions that we've had with the officials in Mexico and then with some of the administration that this \u2013 when we look at energy imports, exports, the U.S. export is twice as much in the energy space to Mexico as we receive from Mexico. So it really meets what the focus is, is to correct any trade imbalances. And so we see that opportunity for us to continue to grow in the energy space in Mexico remaining under the administration. And so going forward, we'd be talking about a lot of opportunities that Carlos and his team have on the drawing board right now, when we get to our Analyst Meeting, and are very excited about it.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. Hi. One housekeeping question and then one maybe more structural question. On the housekeeping side, can you just talk about the impact of bonus depreciation over the next couple of years, and also your position under current tax law in terms of cash tax payments levels over the next couple of years?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I'm going to have Jeff and Trevor talk about that. As Jeff mentioned, when we looked at the provisions of tax reform going forward and the impact of bonus depreciation beyond the time that we had envisioned in our plan, because when we gave you our plans, we always looked at the bonus depreciation effect in the plans as far as that had been continued.", "Now if that continues beyond the timeframe, Jeff indicated to you that we thought it would be \u2013 it's about a 10% more capital or about a $100 million of each utility that would need to be spent to offset that, and we feel that that is very achievable with the kinds of long-term projects that we have like PSEP underway. So, but I'll have Jeff specifically talk on the cash tax impact.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Michael. I will just start by saying that when you get back to what the policymakers' priorities are in California, you think about safety and reliability and grid modernization. I mean, these are kind of ride in the wheelhouse. So we think it is important to our customers.", "So, if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company is spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements, and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. And I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules, which are in place today, were really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to a 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital at each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So, I think one of the things that we're kind of embolden by as we spend about \u2013 invest about $2.7 billion in 2016, which is one of our highest shares ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there is a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan.", "And then with respect to cash taxes, currently, we had an effective tax rate last year of 21%, we think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017, but currently, we are not in a cash taxpaying situation.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yes, we're not in a cash taxpaying situation throughout the period of the plan that we will be presenting.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then, Debbie, thinking a little more structural, you made the organizational shift kind of creating a Utilities Group and an Infrastructure Group. Are you rethinking the broader structure, meaning are you and the board rethinking the broader structure of Sempra at all about what pieces fit well together and have natural synergies with each other across the multiple different businesses and multiple different geographies you serve, and whether there is a greater opportunity to create value, if maybe some of the pieces aren't part of the same corporate puzzles?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I mean, Michael, we always look at that, and that we always assess the structure of our company, we look at the assets that we have and which assets we want to keep and which we want to dispose of. I mean I think you've seen us do that clearly. We \u2013 in the last year we sold REX and we sold the Mobile Gas and Willmut Gas. And so, we always look at those things, and there is nothing in the near-term offing for that, but as those businesses continue to grow; we've tried to preserve optionality. I mean that was one reason we did the IPO in Mexico, we have an ownership in Peru that is outside of our ownership and we tried to structure these things in a way that will give us flexibility. The businesses no longer fit together in a portfolio that we would have the option of changing the way the businesses are structured, but there is nothing that we have \u2013 you should not read this as a sign that anything is planned now.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, Debbie. Much appreciated.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So, on Cameron, in terms of \u2013 I mean if I heard your comments, you sound like you guys were a little bit more oriented maybe towards reducing risks, and I didn't hear as much about expansion or potential expansion, is there been a change or are there any thoughts that, just basically how you guys always have thought about it or is there any sort of reassessment or any change in how you look at the risk or opportunity at Cameron?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "When we \u2013 what Joe was going through is, when we structured Cameron, we were very clear on the risk that Sempra was willing to keep and the risk that we wanted to lay off to other parties. And for Trains 1 through 3, it was very clear to us that we did not want to take the construction risk associated with either pricing or timing of construction, because we were not doing the construction and we were not \u2013 you have a joint venture overseeing the construction, it wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So, we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the project solid, regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion and when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility and we had terms in the agreement that went through, how we would expand to a 5-train facility.", "We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner, so that we can expand to a Train 4, that we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see, if we can reach a resolution on that. And then, once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4, because we think it's going to be one of the lowest cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option.", "And so, nothing has changed in that, but as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion and we're diligently working on that now.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, I apologize for being \u2013 if I missed this. But the border tax adjustment, it just isn't intuitive to me why that would apply, what is it that \u2013 how does that work I guess, why would...", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes, I'm going to have \u2013 go ahead with your question. I am sorry.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm just wondering, I guess, just simply, why would it apply to Cameron in the first place, I guess?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Okay. I'm going to have Jeff go through that for Cameron and as we indicated, we think it's not a highly likely scenario, but there are, depending on how this is drafted in terms of the final tax provisions, and we all know that's a moving target now, so that there are some ways where it could apply and be a benefit. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Good afternoon, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to where the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly as you recall, we have two facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali Power Plant referred to as TdM, that one is held for sale, so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer.", "And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ wind farm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that and the applicable taxes, if border adjustment did go forward and we think that's a non-material issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is, if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us, but there have been scenarios in different bad countries, where the export exemption has applied upstream.", "So think about that as a towing facility, no different than a power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they are ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility, it's just something we want to track closely, because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reducing the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0%.", "So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how the legislation is written, but it's something that we'll be actively following.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. And then I guess the sundry item on the balance sheet went up about $100 million I think from Q3 to Q4. Was there any earnings impact associated with that?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Paul, it's Trevor. No, there is no earnings impact with that. Primarily what the increase there is it's the greenhouse gas allowances and then also the assets associated with the pension benefit. So, those are really the drivers on the increase, but no P&L impacts on those items. We used to combine the Rabbi Trust in there and then that, any movement in the Rabbi Trust would have a small P&L impact, but there we've broken it out a couple lines above.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much.", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Thanks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. Good afternoon. Faisel from Citi. Have you guys looked at this sort of the smaller scale LNG or modular scale LNG sort of concept that we've seen both Cheniere talk about and this new start-up, Tellurian, talk about, have you guys looked at that as sort of a competing technology to the expansions at Cameron?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "We have looked at that technology. We specifically looked at it for ECA and whether or not something like that would be better than trying to convert the facility at Costa Azul. Joe, do you want to comment on that?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Faisel, as Debbie said, we continue to look at many of these things, we look at a lot of projects. We're very mostly focused on the three projects, the Cameron expansion, the Port Arthur and ECA facility and building the larger scale trains, we think those will have the best economics and in terms of getting to the large scale customers. I think a lot of these smaller scale wins work well in the emerging markets things and some of the other ones, but that's not where our current focus is.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah. Because some of these facilities are modular design, but they're still large facilities like 50 million ton, 20 million ton facilities, but I guess with what these new companies are advertising or our technologies are advertising is that they can get the cost structure sort of down below a certain number to make them competitive, so it sounds like you guys have looked at this technology and it's not necessary \u2013 you don't think it's cost competitive with the bigger scale trains.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes. And what I would say is that we've looked at this several times and that it depends on the market that you want to serve, and when we looked at it, as we were looking at potentially serving the Hawaiian market out of Costa Azul and something like that for a smaller market may make sense. I mean most of what we're looking at is the focus on the lowest cost for the volume of the facility and we don't see that technology as being the best technology when you have the kind of facilities that we have, that have great shipping up lanes and docking potential and all of that. If you had to serve islands in the Caribbean or Hawaii, it's by application and by the market you are going after and that we tend to go after the larger markets with long-term contracts and that's kind of our business plan.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "These might eventually turnout okay, but when you are dealing with the big utilities, you're looking for something that has sustained reliability over long periods of time and they want to make sure that when they sign up for something that you are going to be able to deliver operating results over long periods of time.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the conference back to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, thanks for joining us this morning. We really appreciated the questions and we hope to see all of you at our Analyst Conference on April 4 and April 5 in San Diego. And if you have any follow-up questions our IR team will be available to respond to them later today.

Please note that today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With me in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4. Let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Rick. This morning, we reported second quarter EPS of $1.03 or $1.10 on an adjusted basis. With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future.", "Some highlights that I will detail later are since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion in new projects with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California utilities. In addition, we received two positive regulatory outcomes that improved the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year.", "Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule, but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron's schedule has changed.", "Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019, with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include an updated schedule from the contractor, Cameron's own review of the schedule, and the inherent risks in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issues. All parties are focused on bringing the three trains into service as soon as practical.", "Let me be clear. We are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range. In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions in our contract such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection.", "I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extension, or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amount. The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future day. I will reiterate: we expect the protections we put in place to keep Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site.", "Please go to the next slide. This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress against the schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised.", "Now, turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments to date, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed, nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all three heat exchangers have been laid on their foundation. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you.", "With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share.", "Next, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include: $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventories sold forward, $21 million of higher operational earnings, primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico, $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E, and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016, as well as increased production across the portfolio this year.", "The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico.", "And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie, who will go over our business updates.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.", "Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened liquids infrastructure business. I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop three liquids terminals, two of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla, and the third in the Port of Veracruz.", "The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019. Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipeline, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market.", "Moving to Chile, we were awarded transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018.", "Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all party settlement was upheld extending, the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California utilities. Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf, and have started to do so.", "While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter given, the length of time it took to receive this decision, as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for two projects, representing an incremental $500 million of rate based investments, comprised of the Master-Metered Mobilehome Park and a new customer information system at SDG&E.", "Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plans, while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference.", "Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron. This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80.", "Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California utilities on two important matters: the cost of capital extension; and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirmed 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance.", "With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go first to Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Several questions. Listen, I heard your script and I understand your reticence to get too granular on guidance in the context of the change in the Cameron service date being offset by improvements elsewhere. But can you talk to, at a high level, how much of that improvement in 2018 that's offsetting the Cameron delay is coming from new projects versus just better expected returns in either the utilities businesses or the existing infrastructure businesses.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Sure. Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand that. Because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So, let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved in our utilities that was outside of a rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of AFUDC and then putting into service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points.", "So, the utility performance has been very strong and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building on another 200-megawatt solar project in California. And that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that on an ongoing basis producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with the Pima Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into 2019. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Fantastic. Thank you. My second question goes to what's happening at Cameron. And you gave a very detailed explanation, so thank you. But given the track record CB&I has had with other projects with delays, how can you be confident that this is the sort of final straw and there aren't going to be further delays? And have you sort of built in some thinking around that in the new schedule you've given us, or is the new schedule you've given us sort of completely in sync with like specifically what they have told you is their current expectation?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "What they told us is only one piece of the thinking. And trust me, we've done a lot of thinking on this. And then we brought in consultants from the outside who have been working with us to look at all of the scheduled documents, look at the onsite work that have been done, and then give us their independent assessment of the schedule and when we think that the trains can come into service. So what we're giving you today is our best estimate based upon all of the work that's been done by the 70-plus people we have on site as part of the JV, the outside firms that we've been using to validate the information, and then looking at what we've gotten from our contractor, and then just looking at how things can affect projects. And so it's our best estimate based upon all of those factors, not just what the contractor has given us.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And you commented on the fact that CB&I or this joint venture with \u2013 CB&I has with Chiyoda, has indicated that they'd like to be paid more money. It's not clear to you at this point that their claims are valid. Is there any way for you at this point to sort of quantify the types of dollars we're talking about? And if you can or you can't, that being said, how is the contract structured so that you are protected if you have to deploy more capital?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I'm going to have Joe go through this because he has been on the ground working on these issues. So, Joe?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. So let me talk about that. I've spoken about this before. The thing that we looked at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did, with our partners at Cameron JV, sign a lump sum turnkey agreement, and we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people will come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's the normal course.", "I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it, or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. And one of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump-sum turnkey agreement, and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kinds of cost issues. Does that help?", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "That's the best you're going to tell me, then that helps. Thanks, guys. Take care.", "Operator", "All right. And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan from Citibank. Please go ahead.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Faisel.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, Debbie. Did you guys issue any change orders to the contractor at all?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No, we didn't issue change orders to the contractor.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Let me just \u2013 let me just \u2013 throughout the course of the contract, there's been one change order for $12 million. That's it.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "That's it.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Okay, understood. That's the only question on Cameron. And then just on the sort of CCA issue that sort of seems to be ongoing in the news, do you guys have any update on what's going on in your territory with some of these aggregation sort of topics?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, that's a great question because from the Sempra standpoint, we really support the customers having choice and we like the ability of customers having the choice to go to a CCA because we basically earn our money based upon them using our transmission and distribution systems. And so if they want go to another party for procurement, that's great. The problem that we have in California is ensuring that when those customers exit, they take all of the costs with them.", "So, I'm going to have Steve talk about the work that we're doing at the Commission now to have them meet the state law in California, which requires customers exiting to take all of their costs.", "Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Faisel. As Debbie mentioned, our focus really is on ensuring that the Commission complies with current law, which requires departing load to take their fair share of costs. And the three IOUs have put forward a solution to that at the Commission that we're hopeful will be voted on by the end of this year. So to the extent that when there is departing load and they take their costs, that's fine and we just need to make sure that going forward, the Commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say, though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10%. So, we're not long on generation obviously.", "In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues in variables as they look at this issue is what the Commission is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges. So that's a key issue in variable which is causing the cities to take a second look at things.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, got it. And actually I misspoke. There's one more question on Cameron just on \u2013 follow up to Greg's question on the schedule. Does that include any sort of disruptions from weather at all in the hurricane season?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I'll let Joe come in, too.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Faisel. So let me tell you why I have confidence in what we're projecting for you. We have \u2013 and Debbie said, 70 people. We actually now \u2013 we keep increasing. We have about 120 people on the site, and the engineering capacity is looking at what's going on in the site. So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process. In reviewing the forecast forward, what do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's lots of work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it, yet we do have to take into account things like weather, so as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected events. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change, but it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away. You know that recent storm, Cindy, that they had, they were away from the site like a day-and-a-half. So it kind of depends on the severity of it, but we do, in our own analysis, build in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.", "Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Faisel.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Good morning, or afternoon. I guess, first, a couple of questions on Cameron. So the third point you made in terms of the delay that kind of you included the inherent risk in constructing and testing. So that is it fair to say, there's some cushion that you've kind of put into this update? I mean, we'll hear from CB&I I guess on Monday when they report. So, there could be some maybe difference potentially in the timelines there?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "We just used all the data that we had available and really looked at the work being done by our outside consultants against what the contractor had given us and gave our best estimate of when we think the trains will come on in 2019. So I mean, we looked at all the factors we had before us and it's our best estimate for that.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then also, any color that you could give on how the relationships are with the partners going through this process and the like? Any color there?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, since Joe meets with them about every week, I'll have Joe talk about that.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. We have a good relationship with our partners. I mean, remember, our partners are also our customers. And we had a pretty lengthy call with them yesterday. I met with them a couple of weeks ago in Houston. I'm in Houston quite a bit. As we got these schedules, I was poring through the schedules with them and with our engineering teams. I think it's a very constructive relationship, and they have two roles to play there. They're both our partners on the equity side and they are our customers. And so we are working closely together. We're all aligned even with the contractor consortium to try to get this done as soon as possible. But obviously, people have different views on things, but I think we have a good relationship with them.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then last question just on the offsets, specifically on the utility side, I guess, Debbie, you mentioned like $1.4 billion of capital approved outside the rate case. Could you just give a little better sense of are these other projects getting recovered through other mechanisms outside GRC, or it's kind of AFUDC type benefits they are \u2013 yeah.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Most of the projects that are in the $1.4 billion are FERC projects. So you get AFUDC on the projects during construction and then as they are completed, they immediately go into rate base because we use like actual rate base for FERC. So you don't have to go back to the CPUC and try to recover the rate base amount after, it just trues up on the actual rate base based upon what actual rate bases that you are in and so the majority of these are at SDG&E and the majority of them are FERC related. And then on some of the other areas, there are regulatory mechanisms that are put in place outside of the rate case to recover costs that are CPUC related. So we don't have to wait for a rate case.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning, guys. I wanted to talk about new LNG in Port Arthur in particular or you had an announcement during the quarter there that you had I think signed a preliminary agreement with Korea. Could you just maybe put that in context and specifically talk about the MOU that you had at Port Arthur already, how this would work and maybe how if at all this is differentiated from some of the other companies that made announcements at the same time in regards to agreements with Korea?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. We had an agreement with KOGAS and we made an announcement about having a memorandum of understanding with them to hopefully come to some conclusion for them to become a buyer and potentially a foundation buyer which would allow them to take some equity in the Port Arthur facility. And I think part of the differentiators that we found in the market is that there are some buyers who like to take some equity in the projects as well and as KOGAS has expressed an interest in that, we're hoping to get one to three foundation buyers that would take equity positions, and then sell the rest of the gas that's produced to other.", "So, it was really great to have the biggest \u2013 I guess, the second largest LNG buyer in the world want to be in our project and want to have equity in our project. And so, we're in the process of marketing now. We'll also be continuing our discussions with KOGAS to finalize agreements. But we thought it was really positive news.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, shifting gears back to Cameron. I know we've had a couple of questions on the topic already, of course, but you used the language that kind of indicated the project could spill into \u2013 start in 2019. So I think one of the earlier questions spoke to a range of potential outcomes. What's the base case start-up for each train right now? And is your assessment here something that was kind of pushed to you by CB&I, and then you felt like you had to kind of give us this information, or conversely do you feel like you were kind of getting out ahead of what they're saying and this is a relatively I guess conservative view on what could happen?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Let me just kind of talk about what's happened and how we got to this point because I think it's important for you to understand the level of monitoring and meetings and questions and everything that we have with a contractor.", "Once they gave us a detailed schedule back in October, then we've hired outside firms to work with us, and then we have all these people on site to monitor performance against the schedule. And what we started to see is certain things on that schedule being done sooner than the schedule indicated, and other things being done on a schedule later than was indicated.", "And what we wanted to understand is really kind of what the critical path was on the project and what does that mean to the end day on the project, because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact was.", "So we brought in outside consultants. We spent time with the contractor that \u2013 they gave us some dates that they felt that they could meet. We had our consultants, and I'll review all of that type of information, and we came to some of our own conclusions.", "And our conclusions are that, from our standpoint, we feel that we don't want to have any earnings in our financial plans for 2018 for Cameron. We don't want to assume that risk, and we want to give you guidance without any earnings from Cameron.", "If something wonderful happens and it comes in early, that's great. But from our standpoint, from the information that we have, we just felt it was best to take all of the earnings out for Cameron in 2018, and then focus on what we could do as a management team to get to our guidance without having any of Cameron. And we have some great opportunities to offset Cameron. And we just thought it was the right thing to do and that's the way we approached it.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's very helpful context and color there. You mentioned that CB&I came to you with an updated version of the schedule when that was one piece of the equation in your overall analysis here. If they had not done that, I guess I would ask, would you have kind of come to the same conclusion? Would you have given us this updated schedule as it exists right now?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "We would have...", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And the work that you had done preceding that.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I mean, we would have used all the information available to do our assessment of what's the right thing for our company and our guidance that we gave you. And that's exactly what we did in this case.", "And then the schedule that we have from CB&I doesn't have a lot of details and everything on it. So we still have to work through that. But we have to tell you what we believe based upon all the data that we have, and we would have done that whether or not we had a schedule.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Got you. Thanks, Debbie.", "Operator", "All right. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey guys. A couple of different ones. First of all, SoCalGas in the second half of 2017, is there anything unusual when we should think about the earnings bridge from the second half of 2016 and the second half of 2017 at either SoCalGas or SDG&E?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No, not really from year-to-year at the two utilities. I mean, I think the big thing that happened at both utilities is we got our attrition allowance year-over-year. And then to the degree we manage costs within that attrition allowance, that gives us some upside.", "But year-over-year, the companies have done pretty well, when you look at quarter-to-quarter. If you look at on an annualized basis, as you know, there's seasonality at SoCalGas, but there was seasonality at SoCalGas last year as well.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. And one thing, can you talk a little bit about you've got the new renewables -", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "One thing, Michael. I just want to remind you, and we had this and all the data last year and I was assuming you weren't talking about things like this, but we did have an impairment last year at SoCalGas within our South pipeline that we reported in the quarter last year. But that was in the information that we had disclosed (37:47). But there was nothing else between the two companies that was really different year-to-year.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And on Sempra Renewables, how are you looking at over the next couple of years, the potential to add to that backlog or add to that pipeline of potential solar plants? And can you remind us, what's the amount of \u2013 I don't know the right term for it, but literally the land or the sites that you currently control, what's kind of the amount of megawatts you could add over a very long period of time, if you were able to get the contracts?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I mean, there's several hundred megawatts capability at each of those locations. I think you're talking about our two solar locations. And there are several hundred megawatts of capability there. We're focused on developing those and we have been bidding those into RFPs, and then looking at other ways that we might be able to add value on those sites with maybe adding some batteries and being able to do peak-shaving.", "So we have our existing sites that are expandable and then we're also developing new sites. And a lot of our new sites are really developed in the Midwest area with customers we've already done business with and adding wind, which is very economical in a lot of those locations. And we have a lot of customers that we've already done business with that are interested in either expanding an existing site or adding a new site. So we're doing a lot of work in that area. And then as I mentioned, we have contracts now to build a 200-megawatt solar project in California as well that we just talked about.", "So I mean it's a business that we think has growth potential. There's a lot of states that are very interested with renewable portfolio standards and with the economics being there for wind and solar now. But it's one of our growth areas but I wouldn't say that we have changed significantly our capital plans in that area from what we showed you at the Analyst conference.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks Debbie. Much appreciated.", "Operator", "All right. And we will take our last question from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Hi. Just following up on that question. The 200-megawatt solar contract that you just announced, that was not at your existing facilities. This is a new project altogether to do \u2013 because it's coming online so soon, is it something that was already in development when you bought it?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes. It was a project that was in early-stage development. We bought the project and are building it out.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "And do you have a contract with I guess one of the IOUs in California?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "We have average 18 year contracts with a number of parties, some municipalities, a variety of parties where they offtake.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "And in terms of the cost, you talked about having over $1 billion of new capital since the Analyst Day. But adding it all up, unless you got this solar project virtually for free, it must be more than $1 billion. So just wondering if you could give any indication of the CapEx associated with that?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No. We don't give the CapEx associated with individuals but it is over $1 billion. If you add everything up, it's over $1 billion, so.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Okay. And then, just on Cameron. I'm a little confused about the contract terms. You said today that it was a fixed price turnkey contract. And in the past, I thought you had said that to the extent that there were incremental costs associated with building Cameron, that the cost to build would go up, but that your ROE would stay the same. And the way that would happen would be that the higher cost to build would be essentially passed through to customers. So, where am I wrong?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "You're not wrong. That's the way that contract is written.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "That is what I tried to say.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "So...", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "I said it's not a Sempra issue, Leslie, we're protected. We have the contract protections with the contractor, that's the primary. But we also have other protections in our other contracts that keep us whole on a return basis and you have exactly right.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "And so, how are you thinking about Train 4 at this point? Has your thinking shifted on that?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I would say our focus is on Train 1 through 3 right now and getting those done. So we have been having meetings with the partners to look at development of further trains on the site. And Joe just was at a meeting a few weeks ago. I think we're making some progress but I don't expect anything to be resolved before the end of the year.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn it back over to Debbie Reed for closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. Have a great day. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you so much for your participation.

Householder - Sempra Energy", "Analysts", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With me in San Diego are Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.", "Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, October 30, 2017; and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4; and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Rick. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.22 or $1.04 on an adjusted basis. We reported year-to-date earnings per share of $2.99 or $3.87 on an adjusted basis. Based on these strong year-to-date results, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range of $5 to $5.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, our updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $4.13 to $4.43 per share. Excluded from adjusted earnings this quarter was the impairment of SDG&E's wildfire regulatory asset, which I will discuss later.", "On this call, I want to update you on actions we have taken to implement our growth strategy, including plans to create value from the Oncor transaction. I will also review our General Rate Case filings at our California Utilities and the requested rate base to continue to run safe and reliable systems.", "Before I review each of these, please turn to the next slide, where Jeff will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $57 million, or $0.22 per share. This compares to third quarter 2016 earnings of $622 million, or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $265 million, or $1.04 per share. This is in line with third quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $259 million, or $1.02 per share.", "Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, our year-to-date adjusted earnings have been strong and are 11% higher than last year. The quarterly variances are explained in the business unit summary section. The key takeaway from our results is that we're on track to deliver strong full-year earnings.", "And with that, let's move to slide 7; and I'll turn it back over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Jeff. From time to time, it's important for us to take a step back and talk about how our projects and acquisitions fit within our strategy. At our Analyst Conference, we discussed two important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021. First, we expect to deliver roughly double the long-term earnings growth rate of our utility peers. And second, we plan superior dividend growth of 8% to 9%. These were set before consideration of the significant opportunities we've been executing on this year.", "I'd like to highlight our success in growing our business in the six months since our Analyst Conference. We have captured or filed for approximately $1.9 billion in incremental opportunities that were not part of our plan. We also announced the Oncor transaction, which we expect to be accretive to EPS during our plan period. It also adds a new strategic growth platform in the U.S., while helping us maintain the approximately 75/25 U.S./international earnings mix in our portfolio. And our California Utilities submitted their General Rate Case filings, which seeks significant increases in revenue requirements for 2019 needed to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers.", "Please turn to the next slide. Collectively, the new projects add approximately $1.9 billion of additional investments. I would like to highlight our most recent project addition. We announced the pending acquisition of Pemex's 25% equity interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline for approximately $520 million, bringing IEnova's total ownership to 50%. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year. Most of these projects come online later in 2018 and beyond, and we expect that they will improve our growth in the latter years of our plan.", "We have also seen improved operating performance in cash flows from our core businesses. This improved performance coupled with the additional projects should allow us to offset some of the 2019 impact of the previously announced Cameron delay. And just to confirm, there's no change at Cameron as we continue to expect Trains 1 through 3 to producing LNG in 2019. As you can see, since the Analyst Conference, we have developed growth projects across our businesses, and we believe our portfolio mix will allow us to continue to grow earnings at rates roughly double that of traditional utilities, while maintaining a utility-like risk profile.", "Please turn to the next slide. When you look at our existing platform, it's easy to see how Oncor is a great strategic fit. This business has a strong management team and is focused on achieving above-average growth through transmission and distribution investment that create value for customers and shareholders. Oncor manages a large rate base similar to our California Utilities, and adding it to our portfolio increases Sempra's U.S.-based utility earnings mix.", "Further, Texas is a constructive business environment with above-average customer and energy's growth. This acquisition provides meaningful expected accretion and also strengthens our expected credit profile in future years, giving us further balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest in growth.", "I would like to highlight the last point. From the strengthening credit profile provided by Oncor and the ongoing earnings accretion from the transaction, we expect to have $1 billion to $1.5 billion of credit capacity in the outer years of our plan, which should provide us with approximately the same credit profile as we communicated at our April Analyst Conference. The credit capacity could be used to return value to our shareholders through funding of additional growth opportunities, increases and planned annual dividend growth, share repurchases or a combination.", "Before moving on, I'd like to give an update on where we're at in the regulatory process. We filed our Change-in-Control request with the PUC of Texas on October 5; and on October 12, the ALJ and the staff deemed the application sufficient. On October 16, the Commission approved the schedule of 180 days to resolve the case by early April. Now, we are responding to data requests. And we're optimistic that once we address questions and issues identified in the data request, we could work towards constructive settlements with the key intervening parties.", "Many of you have asked about our financing. And while we can't answer specific questions, I will say that as we execute our financing plan, we will consider our progress on the regulatory front. We will also consider a wide range of financing alternatives, so we can make the best decisions based on market conditions at the time of our capital raises.", "Please turn to the next slide. Sempra has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast, with our LNG projects, natural gas storage and IEnova. The addition of Oncor would further strengthen our footprint and serve as a new growth platform to expand our opportunity set. We have a great history of leveraging our platforms and understanding of energy markets to find new opportunities.", "Examples include development of our current renewables business to meet state RPS standards; and planting the roots for IEnova, which started out with a cross-border pipeline in northern Baja and three small LDCs. Our strategic vision for the Texas/Gulf Coast region is to be a major player in these growing energy markets. We expect the addition of Oncor, coupled with our existing presence in the natural gas market, to position us well to be a leading player in the Gulf Coast and cross-border energy markets.", "Please turn to the next slide, where I'll review Oncor's opportunities in more detail. Oncor recently had its rate case approved, which authorized a new ROE and capital structure. And Oncor made the commitment to spend a minimum of $7.5 billion over five years. Their current capital plan forecast is for $8.4 billion and is designed to improve service and reduce cost to customers.", "Some of the things we like about this business are: Oncor is investing in only transmission and distribution projects, so there's no exposure to generation assets which we believe is the right profile for electric utilities going forward; they are making large investments while maintaining the lowest rates in Texas; and they are authorized to recover cost associated with additional projects that are in the customers' best interests through a tracker mechanism without additional approval between rate cases. We believe this is a prudent regulatory mechanism which allow for timely investments to enhance customer safety, operational efficiency, and grid integrity.", "Not many companies have visibility to both a minimum 5-year capital plan and an approved authorized return on that capital. Therefore, the addition of Oncor will provide Sempra even greater visibility to utility earnings growth over the next five years. In addition to the existing 5-year capital plan, Oncor management has identified additional areas of potential investment which would benefit customers, including: expansion of the transmission grid and increasing the capacity of existing transmission facilities to accommodate low growth and reduce congestion; expansion into new growth regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; expedited deployment at smart grid and other technologies; and hardening of critical infrastructure to mitigate storm and other damage and the cost of restoration.", "Please turn to the next slide. As we were contemplating this transaction, the market opportunities we saw led us to believe we can make both companies better in the future. As you can see on the slide, Texas is a leader in energy and holds the number one spot in many areas. By expanding our business portfolio in the region with the Oncor transaction, we believe we are well-positioned to source additional opportunities in the Gulf Coast and Mexican energy market through the strong relationships, market intelligence and experience we have in one of the fastest-growing markets in North America.", "Please turn to the next slide where I will discuss our California Utilities' recent rate case filings. I briefly mentioned some developments at our California Utilities earlier, and would like to take a minute to provide some additional details. With regard to the 2019 General Rate Case filings, we requested a 19% and 11% revenue requirement increase over estimated authorized 2018 levels for SoCalGas and SDG&E, respectively; 6% to 7% average annual attrition mechanisms through 2022, which would result in a four-year rate case cycle; and projected investments related to our risk assessment and mitigation filings, which should help ensure continued safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and increase our rate base over time. We will work constructively to achieve a fair and timely decision to be implemented in 2019.", "Please turn to the next slide. I would like to discuss the impairment that we recorded this quarter related to the cost from the 2007 wildfires. In August, two ALJs issued a proposed decision denying SDG&E's request to recover cost previously incurred related to these wildfires. We vehemently disagree with the PD. While this is not a final decision, under applicable accounting guidance, we concluded that the wildfire regulatory asset should be impaired. However, based upon the evidence and law, we believe the Commission should rule in our favor.", "Since this proposed decision, we have had properly noticed ex parte in all party meetings with the CPUC to reiterate our position that the wildfires fall under the construct of inverse condemnation; and that as such, this cost should be fully recovered through insurance and rate. California courts have allowed plaintiffs to claim inverse condemnation against SDG&E for the 2007 wildfires. To date, courts have applied inverse condemnation to utilities, in part, on the notion that utilities can pass through the cost to ratepayers.", "To further support our position, FERC previously approved, in full, SDG&E's wildfire recovery, considering the inverse condemnation precedent. We will vigorously pursue available avenues to favorably resolve the issue with the CPUC. And if needed, we'll exhaust all available administrative and court appeals.", "Also, in light of the recent wildfires in Northern California, I want to highlight the proactive steps we've taken over the years to implement a comprehensive fire risk mitigation program to help protect our customers and stakeholders. I'll go through the few of many examples. We installed 13,000 new steel distribution and transmission poles with higher-strength conductors and increased line spacing beyond the CPUC's requirement. We developed the largest utility weather network in the nation, with 170 weather stations, each of which provides real-time weather data, delivering enhanced situational awareness to our utility operations and field personnel.", "We also provide this data to firefighting agencies. We contracted for supplemental firefighting resources, including one of the largest helitankers in the world; and like our weather data, we make this resource available to our region. And we developed and implemented an aggressive vegetation management program, where we have a database of 460,000 trees that are in close proximity of our line. We systematically assess, remove, and trim vegetation away from our lines and facilities to reduce fire risk.", "Now, please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've been working diligently to deliver on our value proposition. First, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range; second, we're leveraging our growth drivers to execute additional projects at both our utility and infrastructure businesses to add to future earnings growth; and third, we're advancing the Oncor transaction by making substantial regulatory progress, and we're looking forward to adding this strategic growth platform to our business.", "With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and start to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go first to Greg Gordon with Evercore.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "A couple of questions. I apologize if I'm a little fuzzy on it. Can you take us through the initial Los Ramones Norte investment, and what the economics were that you articulated on that project? And what should we expect the incremental economics to be on this additional $520 million investment?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Sure. We have been a part owner of this project. As you know, we own 25% of it. And what we did is we acquired Pemex's 25% share, bringing our total investment up to 50% of the project. I'll have Joe talk a little bit more about Ramones Norte. And we're hoping to close this in the end of this year 2017.", "Joe, you want to...", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. Hey, you might recall that when we \u2013 IEnova actually acquired our 50/50 Pemex's interest in our joint venture, we excluded this particular pipeline, because this pipeline was the one that was actually in construction at that time. And as the parties negotiated for the acquisition of Pemex's interest in the joint venture, they were hopeful of getting a price that recognized that the pipe was fully operational, and all the construction risk, and everything was behind them, but that wasn't the case.", "So, we actually pulled this piece of the operation out of that and continued the joint venture, while the pipeline was being built. And now that's fully operational, it's already in service and have much lower risk, we went back to them, and they were still interested in selling that interest. And so, we struck a deal with them, which is a really good value, but probably closer to the lower end of our normal expectations of high single digit, low double-digit unlevered returns, and that's simply because it has lower risk. It's completed, it's in service and operating, and it's a great pipeline and is one of the biggest pipelines taking gas to Mexico from the U.S.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Fantastic. Joe, while I have you, can you give us an update on what the \u2013 now that we've hopefully gotten through hurricane season, whether you are still comfortable with the productivity level you're seeing at the Cameron site? And when it is that we'll get another big sort of update from you on how you're doing on milestones?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Look, before Joe says anything, I just want to remind everyone that we believe, and we firmly believe, from everything that we see now that Cameron will be liquefying natural gas in all three trains come 2019. And they've made a lot of progress on construction, and things seem to be going well, and not too much impact, it appears, from the hurricane.", "Joe, why don't you add a little color?", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Greg, you pointed it out, and we're not completely through the labeled hurricane season, but I think we've made it through. And unfortunately, for all of you in the Northeast, it seems like the weather is moving that way.", "But the good news is, and although we recognize that certainly a lot of people in the Gulf Coast and across Texas suffered as a result of the storm and we contributed money to the efforts there, the storm had relatively little impact on the actual Cameron LNG site. And as far as the schedule goes, Debbie just mentioned, that we have no change in the schedule. We did get a claim from the contractor around Hurricane Harvey. It was a named storm, so they're allowed to make a claim, but it was rather immaterial, less than a couple of weeks delay. So, that didn't really change the schedule and an immaterial amount of money related to it.", "They have told us they might have some additional claims, but we don't have information on that. But I think it's pretty well-recognized that there wasn't much damage. We're still on track. Things are going well. They were back on the site working hard within a couple of weeks of the storm. And so, that's where we stand.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Right. My last question may seem a little bit esoteric, but on the inverse condemnation case, first, is it on the docket? Is it on the calendar due for a vote at any point soon? And two, if this were to go against you, don't you think it would have tangible enough consequences to people's expectations of risk in California that you would want to reassess what you believe to be your true cost of capital in the next review? Because if they're not going to honor the law here, then the true cost of capital for a California utility in the normal course of business is, in my perspective, materially higher than what you settled on earlier this year.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, it's on the calendar for November 9, and it's been on the calendar three times, and then postponed. So, we don't know what's going to happen on November 9. Obviously, with the situation in Northern California and the Napa fires that this has to be a focus area of the Commission. And the laws in California have been pretty clearly determined by the courts to apply to the investor-owned utilities. And these laws rely on the fact that these utilities that provide services for the public interest and have facilities in the public domain would have the ability to recover cost, and that therefore, they have strict liability. And that it is something that we will put through the court system if the Commission does not rule in our favor.", "In terms of the cost of capital, I think that's speculative at this time as to how all of this comes out. We look at the risks that we can mitigate. And as I've said earlier in my remarks, we have really focused on a lot of mitigation efforts to reduce our fire risk in Southern California and our service territory. Our insurers have told us that we have the absolute best fire mitigation plan that they've seen in the industry. So, our focus is on doing what we can control, and that we're hopeful that the Commission decides like they did earlier when they granted us the funds for FEMA recovery, which was our cost of restoration from the fire, and that FERC granted us full recovery in this. And that it would seem a little odd not to have the same type of recovery with the law in California. But at this point, we'll wait and see what happens when the Commission decides.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Much appreciated. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Julien", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. So, I wanted to follow up first on the Oncor side. Obviously, you've talked about some of the process here. Can you give us a little bit of an update on settlement negotiations, I know, just to the extent which they continue to happen, and expectations on even getting to a timeline there, first and foremost?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Sure. I would first say that we've been in settlement discussions for a few weeks, and that our modification through our financing actually came from hearing from the parties as to what their principal concerns were. And when we heard those principal concerns, we decided to simplify the financing and make our regulatory filing consistent with the 65/35 equity to debt that we talked about. And that really came from a lot of our discussions with the parties.", "Since that time that there have been some discussions with parties, but they're in the discovery process right now. And they, of course, have to do their diligence. And then, we would expect as soon as that discovery is complete, which should be very shortly, that we would enter into full settlement negotiations with the key parties in the case. Speculating timing on when a settlement could be reached is difficult, of course. But I think, really, by addressing the financing concern, that addressed a lot of the issues that we had heard from the parties.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. All right. Excellent. I'll leave that one be. And then moving back to Cameron real quickly, can you elaborate a little bit just in terms of you reaffirming the timeline. Is it that the hurricanes this summer, did they ultimately just shift within the expected delivery time window, or is it sort of offset by productivity improvements at other points? And I just want to make sure we're sort of crystal clear about how \u2013 the reaffirmation for folks out there?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I mean, we told you when we gave you the schedule the last time, it was not just a schedule that we have looked at and had hired consultants to do assessment of the schedule. And we've gotten third-party input when we looked at what we told you on the last call relative to the schedule, that what we saw was no change from those expectations coming through the hurricane season. There were some small delays, but we would not have any major impact of the hurricane. Joe sits on the Management Committee and is very close to this, so I'm going to ask him to add anything he wants to that comment.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Julien. I think it's more like within the window. Yeah, they're making good progress at the site and they were there right after. And so, we just didn't lose that many days, and then the hurricane season kind of came to a bit of a halt at that point. So the weather has been good, and they've been working hard at the site and making a lot of progress. So I think it's a combination of those things, but I'd say we're probably kind of within the window. But still the good thing is, we're still going to report earnings of $300 million to $350 million in 2020.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. All right. Excellent. And then, lastly, just real quickly on...", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "From Cam.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "From Cam. As Debbie said, from Cameron.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "From Cameron, yeah.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Yes, of course.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "I just want to clarify.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Of course.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Exactly. Absolutely, absolutely. It wasn't lost on me. Just very quickly on the CapEx side, wanted to make sure I'm hearing you guys right about obviously a lot of success year-to-date on adding things to the bucket. Where do you stand about reevaluating the open season in Texas, and then just in general about accelerating CapEx focused on Texas, be it Oncor or elsewhere?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, at this point, the open season, we just got the results in and we're contacting the parties who have expressed interest. And we don't have anything to announce at this time, but that we have a lot going on in the Gulf Coast region. People forget sometimes that we have the joint venture with TransCanada to build the Marine Pipeline across the Gulf region to Mexico. That's under construction right now. We have some storage development opportunities tied to the LNG facility. We have the pipelines tied to the LNG facility. And then, we have the three trains at Cameron under construction in Louisiana, and then are looking at moving forward with Port Arthur.", "So we see a lot of opportunity, most of which has been on the gas side. And we think that Oncor also has, in talking to their leadership, opportunities. They've been a little capital-constrained, as you might imagine, and have opportunity to invest for the benefit of their customers in areas like technology and in release of congestion that will actually reduce cost to customers, improve service. And we've asked them to start looking at, if they were not in such a capital-constrained situation, what more would they be able to do in terms of investments over time. And I think that they're really excited about the opportunities to look at spending time focused on how they grow their business versus dealing with five years in a bankruptcy court. So I think there's some great opportunities, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning. Going back to the wildfires, I had two questions on that front. One was just kind of how you're perceiving, I guess, the exact legal definition of negligence there, and how that was interpreted in the proposed decision? And then, secondly, on that front, kind of knowing what you know today and, let's say, hypothetically the CPUC does come out and reject your request, would you have had the opportunity to act differently in the court process at all?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, I'm not sure if I fully understand your question, but I'll try to answer as I interpret it. That negligence is not the standard for inverse condemnation. I mean the court, in looking at the fire claims never considered whether there was negligence or gross negligence; they only considered whether our facilities were involved in the fires. And if that is shown to be the case that your facilities are involved in the fires, the standard in California is strict liability.", "And that standard of strict liability comes from the view that you can spread those costs across the ratepayers. And it was a law that was really started from municipalities, largely, so they have facilities in the public good. And then if something flooded, or there was an issue that they could recover those costs across all of the customers in the municipality. The courts in California did interpret it to apply to the investor-owned utilities as well. So you don't ever get into a negligence standard through the court system on this.", "And that's the concern that we have with what's the proposed decision. It doesn't rely on how the courts determine how inverse condemnation is applied. It sets a different standard that is not the standard that's used by the court to assess whether you have a liability. So, that's where we will be fighting that. And we do not believe that \u2013 clearly, FERC saw that, and FERC looked at the same set of facts and believed that we were a reasonable utility operator; the very same set of facts, and that we were a reasonable utility operator. And so, these ALJ proposed decision, and I will stress, these are not Commission decisions at this point. They are ALJ proposed decision, we just see as inconsistent with the law and inconsistent with how the other regulatory agencies looked at the same set of facts.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Got you. But then, let's say, hypothetically, you could rewind the clock almost 10 years now and going into the original court processes, know that you would not ultimately get recovery from ratepayers, would that have changed your legal options at all, I guess, negligence or no negligence?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No, because that's not the standard. We would have had no option on that. The courts determined that the 2007 fires fell under inverse condemnation, that our facilities were involved, and the fact that our facilities \u2013 there's no negligence whatsoever that's a consideration on those cases. And if we had tried to fight that, that's not the standard that's applied with inverse condemnation. So, it wouldn't have changed anything. And that's the thing that why we will go back to the court system if it's not ruled in our favor.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay...", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "The other thing I'll mention to your point, this is Jeff Martin, is the most important thing is we were prudent operators back in 2007, just like we are today. So, it doesn't really change, as Debbie's really going to the fact that the law at that time relied on inverse condemnation, and that's the basis of why we think we should have recovery.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "And I would say FERC determined we were prudent operators in their decision. So, it's just \u2013 yeah.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. I know you guys have been pretty clear, I think, on your position here and what your options were, so thank you for that clarification. My follow-up is just on Oncor. Maybe not necessarily your financings, but in regards to the memo that came from one Commissioner last week on the process. Does that kind of fall outside your expectations as it relates to the ultimate outcome of the case or your options here? Does it surprise you maybe given your discussions with interveners up into this point at all?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No, not at all. I mean, this is the discovery process that occurs. And if you look at the other cases that have been before the Commission, that this Commissioner has asked similar kinds of question, it's part of their diligence. And I would expect the Commission and interveners to due diligence.", "In the next 10 days, we will be submitting supplemental testimony to address all these issues. We look forward to addressing those issues. We have nothing of concern and nothing to hide that we have great financial strength as a business, and we look forward of explaining all of that, explaining the kinds of contracts we have on LNG, where we have really mitigated the risk in our types of contracts. So, that we will submit our responses to the PUC of Texas, and we would expect them to consider all of that as part of the fact base in the case.", "Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, understood. Thank you, Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator. And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Couple of easy questions for you. One on Southern California Gas. And there's something I'm not entirely sure I understand. Maybe I'm misstating how much growth is there. At the Analyst Day back in the spring, you all highlighted that you thought \u2013 I think it was in Steve Davis' slides that Southern California Gas' rate base could get to about, I don't know, around $7.6 billion in 2021. And yet in today's slide deck, you're showing it at $9.7 billion in 2022. That's a pretty big change, right? I'm looking at slide 13 from today. And I want to make sure I'm following that just because I know you've announced a bunch of projects, but I didn't realize looking at that chart on page 13, you announced something that could take SoCalGas' rate base all the way up close to $10 billion.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Let me take you back to the Analyst Conference and explain or remind you how we did the forecasting for the utilities at the Analyst Conference. And what we told you at that time, when we looked at the out-years of the plan, and 2021 is the one that you're providing, all we did is we took the approved rate base that we had, and then we applied the attrition factor that had been approved for the utility over the life of the plan, so that's all we did. And that it did not reflect our regulatory filings; it did not reflect this new process, this risk adjustment mechanism, the ramps that we had to look at risk, and then how do we mitigate those over time with a systematic replacement of key components of the system.", "And so, what you're seeing now is what we filed for in the rate case, that would be our 2022 with the amount of rate base we requested and the attrition mechanisms we requested in the rate case. That is not to say that we're going to get all of that, but that is what we've requested. And in that rate case now, we have specific projects and specific activities to consume that capital. When we did it before, all we used is what had been approved with an attrition factor on it.", "So, this gives you greater visibility to what we're looking at in terms of CapEx requirement for the utility. Again, it's our filing, we may not recover all of that, but we think we have great justification for it, because that all came out of the process that the Commission has asked us to use which is this risk-adjustment process.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. So, in other words, what you're saying today is that your expectation, both for capital spends and rate base growth at Southern California Gas is significantly higher than what you outlined back at the Analyst Day in the spring?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. It's higher for both utilities; it's about $1 billion higher. The 2022 number is about $1 billion higher than the 2021 number we gave you. And for SDG&E at about $2 billion higher for SoCalGas, which came out of our rate case filing, and going through detailing from this risk process that we were required to use, what are the expenditures that we need for our business, and then what is the normal replacement cycle for replacement capital. So, that's what we have in our regulatory filings.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. And then one Texas question or an Oncor question. The Oncor rate case, already been resolved, the new rates go into effect soon, are there any post-deal infusions you have to make into Oncor? I know they're getting a higher equity layer, or is that all just kind of factored in as part of the transaction?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, the Oncor Board of Directors will determine how the \u2013 they changed their equity and the rate case; they thickened their equity. And the Oncor Board of Directors will determine how that equity gets put into the business. So, it was approved in the rate case.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "But it's not incremental equity above the purchase price that Sempra has to put in.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Jeff, why don't you describe how that...", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Michael. The purchase price we've agreed to is $9.45 billion. As you've talked about, subsequent to our original purchase request, they have finalized the rate case and that they need to move the equity layer up from roughly 40% equity to 42.5% equity. As you know, along the way, it depends on when our closing occurs and what time post-closing we actually have to fill up the rest of that equity infusion. But if there are additional equity requirements for Sempra, it's been fully factored into all of our financial analysis.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. So it's factored into all of the $0.10 to $0.20 accretion dilution, all that...", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "...kind of stuff that you put out in the public domain.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Yes, it is.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes, it is.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.", "Operator", "And next, we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good morning. Can you hear me?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning. Yes, we can hear you. Hi, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. Okay. So just with the wildfire, just sort of a follow-up, I think, on the earlier question. Just to make this crystal clear, this has nothing to do with negligence, nothing associated with the ALJ's ruling, et cetera, correct?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "The inverse condemnation law in the state has no negligence requirement, and that's the law that governs who has accountability for the claims under inverse condemnation. The ALJ had indicated that there are things that they thought that we should have done differently in hindsight review, looking at things, but that there's no court that has come out with any finding of negligence in this case.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And I guess the question that comes up, of course, is that since we've had wildfires in other parts of the state, if there was to be found, hypothetically speaking, negligence associated with the utility, would a finding in your favor have any ramifications with respect to a situation in which negligence was the reason associated with liability, if you follow me?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I don't know how I can explain. Negligence is irrelevant. That if you have a fire that your facilities were involved in, the law of the State of California, if it shows that your facilities were involved in that fire, you have strict liability. You don't go to court. No one claims negligence in court. They claim inverse condemnation. And if it's shown that your facilities were involved, there's a strict liability standard.", "All the claims that we paid out on our fire had to do with strict liability and inverse condemnation. And that law is created because you were supposed to be able to collect from your customers, or if you're a municipality, those in the municipality. So negligence is not an issue. No one claims in these cases negligence. They come in and they claim its inverse condemnation, and that you have strict liability for it. So all the claim \u2013 I'm sorry?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So I appreciate that, and I thank you for the clarification. I'm just wondering though, in terms of the issue of recovery from ratepayers \u2013 I guess, I should have articulated this more clearly \u2013 in terms of recovery from ratepayers, would the issue of negligence be an issue that might come up? Do you follow what I'm saying? Because it sounds like you guys are saying that there were some things in the ALJ where they said that you might have done some things better, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.", "But I guess what I'm wondering is, and I guess the reason why the question is being asked I think to a certain degree because of the recent wildfires is, if it was found that a utility had been negligent in terms of how it was \u2013 I'm not suggesting you guys were involved in that, I'm just suggesting \u2013 I'm just questioning, if that was the case, would that have any impact, in your opinion, on the ability to recover from ratepayers?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "It should not. It should have no basis. If you just look at why you buy insurance, and we get rates funded to buy insurance. Insurance, it doesn't matter, you pay out a claim, an insurance claim, and it doesn't matter whether there's negligence or not in an insurance claim. Insurance is to protect you. And this law basically is like a replacement of insurance. And so, it should have no basis. It should have no basis.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. I appreciate that. The second question I'd like to ask you is with respect to Oncor. And just, in general, I mean are you guys willing to keep the ring-fencing in other provisions long-term? Should we think about that as sort of long-term setup, or how should we think of those?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, when we look at Oncor and the ring-fencing and we look at the independent Board of Directors, at some point it would be nice for us to have built the confidence of the regulators in the State of Texas by how we act as an owner, that they would see that we should be treated like any other utility in the State of Texas. And other utilities don't have that kind of structure. But I think it's something that we have to earn over time, with the way that we capitalize that business and ensure that we honor the provisions and that they see that Oncor management really makes the decisions for the best interest of Texas and its customers. And I hope we are able to earn that confidence from the regulators over time.", "When we look at the ring-fence and those provisions, we felt it was not significantly different than what we have or how we've operated with our California Utilities under a first priority condition, where we have to put capital into those utilities to meet their needs. And so, is it livable? Yes. Would we want to change it over time with us proving that we were strong owners and the Commission feeling that we should have the same kind of regulatory structure that the other Texas utilities do. When we get to that point, we would look at maybe a way to transition.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, sorry, just back to the wildfire and the write-off charge. What I'm a little bit unclear about is, you just got an ALJ recommendation, and just based on that, it seems that you guys are taking the write-off, even though we don't have a final decision. And I'm just wondering, I guess, there must have been some sort of threshold question about whether or not you thought it was likely or not. And I just wonder if you could address specifically what led to the write-off and hypothetically, if you did get a ruling in your favor, we just see that reverse, is that correct or is there anything else we should think about?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. Let me just comment that the standard is very high; it's an 80% probability standard. And what we looked at is all of the facts. We looked at \u2013 that we had an ALJ proposed decision; we don't have an alternate decision at this point; and that we have to meet this 80% probability standard. And under the accounting rules, we felt that the interpretation of the accounting rules would cause us to feel, at this point, that we would have to take this impairment.", "If the Commission rules in our favor, then obviously, that whatever the ruling would grant us, then that would come back. And I would stress that is a non-cash impairment, but it was our interpretation of the accounting rules is applied to all of the information that we had.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Awesome. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Faisel. Faisel?", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yeah. I'm here. Sorry, guys. Can you hear me?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Debbie. I just had one follow-up question. Actually not a follow-up question, a separate question. Just in terms of the Aliso Canyon investigation, is there any update on the timing of the study that's being done by Blade?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No. They're in the process right now of removing the casing on site, but there's been no indication of when they're going to complete their work. So, as soon as we hear anything, of course, we would report that. But at this point, they're just in the process of removing the casing from the well.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. So, they're still on site, I guess...", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "...doing more of the physical work. They're not even ready to put a report together, it sounds like.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "No. They're not at all ready to put a report together. They haven't even completed the casing removal, so.", "Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn things back over to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, thanks again for all of you joining us today. And we hope to see many of you next week at EEI. If you have any follow-up questions, our IR team will be available, and have a great week.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.", "With me in San Diego are several members of our management team. Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.", "Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K.", "It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 27, 2018, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.", "With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we will review our 2017 results and key accomplishments, both of which highlight an exceptional operational and financial year, and provide a strong foundation for future growth. We believe 2018 will be a transformational year for Sempra with the expected closing of the Oncor transaction, further progression of Cameron and execution of a robust capital plan.", "2018 also marks our 20th anniversary. Since our formation, we've continued to strengthen our business with strategic investments that have provided for more than a 600% increase in shareholder value. Later, I'll share some of our key goals for 2018 that should help us continue our strong performance well into the future.", "In 2017, we exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full year 2017 earnings of $1.01 per share or $5.42 per share on an adjusted basis, well above the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range, which was $5.30. Also last week, our board approved another 9% increase to our annual common dividend, bringing it to $3.58 per share. This marks the eighth consecutive year we have raised our common dividend and represents over 40% growth since 2013. It also exemplifies our strong commitment to our common dividend, an integral component of our value proposition.", "I'm also pleased to say that we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share, which now includes both the anticipated near-term effects of tax reform and the expected positive impact of Oncor. Jeff will review the key drivers of our 2018 guidance a little later on.", "Please turn to the next slide. 2017 was an exceptional year for Sempra. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the key accomplishments and how we've carried this momentum forward into 2018. First, our full year adjusted earnings increased approximately 8%. The main driver of this outperformance was higher operational earnings across our businesses. Our success stems from our focus on execution, managing our business efficiently, and our ability to find new growth opportunities across our businesses as demonstrated by the approximately $1.9 billion we've added to our already robust capital plan since last year's analyst conference.", "Second, we announced the Oncor transaction in August and constructed a plan to achieve approximately 80% ownership of this exceptional company. Once closed, this transaction will enhance our business mix and provide increased and more geographically diversified utility earnings. On that note, we're working to close this transaction expeditiously, and have reached a settlement agreement with all 10 stakeholders. The Public Utility Commission of Texas has requested that a proposed order to approve the transaction be drafted and put before them for a vote as soon as March 8. We have also completed the necessary financing and expect the transaction to close soon after Commission approval.", "Please turn to the next slide. Third, our confidence at Cameron is bolstered by another year's worth of construction progress and a constructive settlement agreement that we entered into with Cameron's EPC contractor in December of last year. The agreement resolved all known and unknown claims through the agreement date, falls within the project budget, estimated contingencies with financing commitment, and aligns the interests of all parties to focus on the goal of having all three trains producing LNG in 2019.", "Fourth, at our California Utilities, we recently reached a revised settlement agreement regarding SONGS that maintains the outcomes of the original agreement for Sempra's shareholders. If approved by the CPUC, our customers will have added benefits compared to the originally settled case. We also continue to make progress regarding Aliso. As I said on our call this time last year, we've been focused on resolving the remaining Aliso-related issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including resolving legal claims.", "This year, we've made a substantial progress, including resuming reinjection to support reliability and collecting substantial insurance proceeds. In addition, we recorded a $20 million expense based upon progress related to a potential litigation settlement with certain parties. As you can see, we performed well financially and operationally, and resolved many key business issues, thereby, mitigating certain risks. We also identified new growth opportunities and made significant progress on the Oncor transaction.", "Please turn to the next slide. I'll now discuss a few of the important items we'll be focused on in 2018. Regarding Oncor, we expect the final decision as soon as March 8. With respect to Cameron, all parties remain focused on Cameron producing LNG from all three trains in 2019. We've included a photo illustrating Cameron's progress in the appendix for your reference. At our California Utilities, we're moving ahead with the 2019 General Rate Case filings in a timely manner and a substantial amount of the investing we requested, in this case, would be used to further enhance the safety and reliability of our systems.", "Moving on to California's wildfire situation. We have developed and are executing on a three-pronged strategy, which includes filings on the regulatory front, requesting legislative actions to improve fire safety and provide greater clarity at the California Legislature and continuing operational fire risk mitigation. So far, we have filed a request for rehearing of the CPUC decision and SDG&E's 2007 wildfire preceding. A terribly flawed decision that has created much of the confusion and uncertainty that exists today.", "If the CPUC decides not to rehear the decision, we will proceed expeditiously in the courts. I think it's important to know that FERC approved full recovery for the same fires and same facts over four years ago. Legislatively, we are joining a broad coalition of interests focused on helping the state fix the multi-faceted problems associated with the devastating fires that are impacting the state's environment and economy.", "More specifically, the situation demand solution. Specifically, three areas that needs to be fix are, the inconsistency between inverse condemnation and the CPUC disallowing cost recovery; the availability and affordability of fire insurance for utilities, businesses and homeowners; and the establishment of objective and measurable criteria on prudency.", "Operationally, we continue our decade-long efforts to reduce fire risk within our SDG&E service territory. We believe our efforts to fire-harden our electrical system, to improve situational awareness by utilizing new advanced technologies such as the deployment of 170 weather monitoring stations, and a high tech camera network in fire-prone areas, and to develop strong partnerships and operating protocols with fire agencies, have and will continue to improve the safety of our communities.", "Lastly, as we do on a regular basis, we are reviewing opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, to support growth and maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings. Specifically, we're looking at asset sales, having ongoing discussions with the credit rating agencies, initiating our repatriation plan, utilizing the strong and growing cash flows across our businesses, and finally considering aftermarket (11:12) offerings.", "We will provide additional details regarding asset monetization repatriation and other plans to continue to build our balance sheet at our analyst conference on June 28. Please turn to the next slide, where Jeff will review our 2018 guidance. Jeff?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. What we're excited about is having the opportunity to build on our success in 2017 and early 2018. Today, we're affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. Two key updates have impacted our business since we last discussed guidance. First, on our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call, we projected the overall impact from tax reform in the 2021 timeframe to be generally neutral.", "Now that tax reform legislation is passed, we're pleased to confirm that our long-term assessment remains neutral to slightly positive. We will, however, encounter near-term pressure in 2018, but expect that to be offset as Cameron comes online. Second, with the progress we made on the Oncor transaction, we're now including it in our guidance. Oncor accretion is expected to be roughly $0.20 per share for 2018.", "Please turn to the next slide. Next, let me provide an overview of how we think about tax reform. I believe we can all agree that a strong economy benefits all businesses. And since we're strong believers in the need to invest in U.S. infrastructure, tax reform is a clear benefit from that perspective. So over the next few years, you should expect to see us adapt our strategy to take advantage of this new environment.", "Next, in terms of our domestic utilities, lower federal corporate income tax rates will benefit customers. This should provide headroom for CapEx spending and allow for an easier path to improve safety, reliability and technology, all of which are priorities for us.", "Second, the new territorial tax system increases the value of our international businesses by allowing greater flexibility to optimize our global capital structure and through repatriation of excess offshore cash back to the United States. Also when it comes online, Cameron should realize $65 million to $75 million of increased annual earnings due to the lower tax rate.", "Next, let's look back at the impacts of tax reform in 2017. We recorded a non-cash earnings charge of $870 million. About $182 million resulted from the re-measurement of deferred taxes. Approximately $328 million related to the deemed repatriation tax. And roughly $360 million related to the accrual of U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes associated with our planned repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings.", "To be clear, the last two items are very important. This now allows us to repatriate approximately $4 billion with minimal, if any, expected foreign, federal, or state tax expense. To take advantage of this benefit, we plan to immediately begin repatriating in 2018 and expect to bring back approximately $1.6 billion over the next five years, with the remaining $2.4 billion returning thereafter as the businesses generate additional cash at the local level.", "Please turn to the next slide. Going forward, we expect that tax reform will have a neutral earnings impact in 2020 and become slightly positive longer term. Next, let me address our domestic utilities. We expect the overall impact to our utilities to be generally neutral, and our customers will benefit from the lower tax rate. As previously mentioned, there is an opportunity for increased infrastructure spending while maintaining customer bills. This opportunity to increase CapEx is not included in our current assumptions.", "Second, the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate has the most significant near-term impact. This is a result of the lower tax shield on our corporate cost, which is primarily interest. However, this negative impact is offset as Cameron comes online and as we reduce parent debt levels.", "Next, in terms of undistributed foreign earnings, we expect no material incremental tax expense related to the $4 billion we plan to repatriate. We continue to view our international businesses having strong growth opportunities, and we're also pleased that tax reform provides improved flexibility to bring cash back to the United States.", "Regarding interest expense deductibility, we currently assume no limitation. This is based upon our current understanding the application of the law, but could change in the future as additional guidance and regulations are made available. Like many other utility holding companies that are currently not paying cash taxes, we expect to receive lower tax-sharing payments from our utilities. Although the credit rating agencies have viewed this as a negative for the entire industry, we're actually in a unique position to be able to mitigate much of this impact through our new repatriation program.", "In summary, here's what's most important about tax reform. First, our businesses that operate at a loss are negatively impacted with the largest impact being felt in 2018. By 2020, we expect tax reform to be neutral as our Cameron LNG facility comes online and increasingly positive over time.", "In terms of repatriation, this is a real positive because we now have improved flexibility to bring back $4 billion with minimal or no expected tax expense, and we'll be updating our work with the credit rating agencies this spring with the intent of providing a clear view of how we plan to strengthen our balance sheet over time at our June analyst conference.", "Please turn to the next slide where I'll discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter losses of $501 million or $1.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $389 million or a $1.54 per share. Full year 2017 earnings were $256 million or $1.01 per share. This compares to 2016 earnings of $1.370 billion or $5.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2017 earnings were $5.42 per share. This compares favorably to our 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.05 per share.", "Next, please turn to the next slide. The 8% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings was driven primarily by higher operational earnings in 2017, including $44 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, and AFUDC equity at SDG&E; $24 million of lower losses at Sempra LNG & Midstream; $16 million of higher earnings from PSEP and AMI at SoCalGas; and $8 million of higher operational earnings in South America.", "Please turn to the last slide where I'll hand it back to Debbie.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Jeff. 2017 was another successful year for Sempra. We were able to exceed our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance, while positioning ourselves to make 2018 a transformational year. We also affirmed 2018 EPS guidance and increased our annual common dividend by 9%. All of this can be attributed to execution of our operational plan and leveraging our growth drivers to add significant incremental investments. We look forward to carrying this momentum through 2018 and beyond.", "Before closing, I'd like to recognize Steve Davis, whose retirement we announced back in September; and Rick Vaccari, who will also be retiring in March. Together, they have contributed over 50 years of experience at the company. On behalf of the team at Sempra, we wish them both great happiness in retirement.", "And with that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop, to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good morning.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi, Julien. How are you?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Rick and Steve. I just wanted to step in real quickly and ask you, first, on the California backdrop. Can you elaborate a little bit more on your thoughts in terms of where this would go from a legislative perspective, first, with respect to any specific governance (20:40) efforts, and then also with respect to any kind of omnibus legislative efforts?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I think the timing of your question is great, Julien, because yesterday, Assemblyman Holden had the Utilities Committee come together, and President Picker from the PUC testified before, as did the Head of the PUC staff. And the two things that really came out of that meeting yesterday that I think are significant that we're starting to see as real changes are an urgency to resolve the issues of inverse condemnation and a recognition that there are several factors that impact the cause, the scope, and the spread of fires, and it is irrational to place all of that burden strictly on the utilities. And that was kind of the tone of the meeting yesterday, which I think is a real positive in terms of the focus on what needs to be done to correct that.", "One of the things they did yesterday is that the Commission's staff presented some of the best practices, and they relied heavily on the practices that SDG&E has put in place since the 2007 fires, with the use of technology and the actions to look at proactive deenergization when there are risk issues and all. So, I think two things are happening. I think that there is a focus now on having to resolve this inverse condemnation issue legislatively. At the conclusion of the hearing, they asked that the PUC attorneys work with the attorneys for the Assembly, and look at if they're interpreting the legal issues the same. So, I think there's going to be some movement in that area.", "And then further, I think this focus on what the utilities can control is the best practices and having the focus be on do the things that you can control, and then the state needs to have a more \u2013 a broader look at what can be done to reduce the fire risk, to improve our firefighting efforts, and a whole variety of issues that needs to have a comprehensive solution. But I thought the hearing yesterday was a real positive sign of more attention and urgency.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Excellent. And then just following up on the guidance for 2018, I think I heard you right at $0.20 of accretion for Oncor. Can you elaborate a little bit more? I know this may be a little early days on how you're thinking about that. And then separately and probably related, what's the pace of capital spending you all are thinking about of late? I know this may be a bit preemptive, but obviously there's a few different moving things happening in Texas of late.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. If you look at Oncor, the $0.20 that we used for this year was to kind of give you a sense of how we offset some of the tax reform implications, and we detailed that in our slides. And Oncor helps us meet a portion of those impacts for this year from tax reform. But the great operations that we've had from our businesses, and you saw the results in 2017, and that was really all of our businesses just performed exceptionally well. So, we see that continuing on until 2018.", "And I'm going to turn it to Jeff to talk about any more of the details around the Oncor and how we're looking at CapEx going forward. But we basically share with you, for Oncor, about $8.4 billion is part of their plan over five years. But they're looking at things that they can do in their business that may lead to, over time, some increases in that, especially in terms of some technology.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Hey, Julien. Good morning. As you think back to our analyst conference last spring, you recall that we rolled out a $14.2 billion on balance sheet capital program. We had probably (24:43) another $1.8 billion off balance sheet. As Debbie indicated, that excluded the new $8.4 billion of capital spending, of which obviously 80% of that would be accounted for us related to Oncor. So I think that gives you some sense of going forward. You're probably looking at something close to $3 billion per year with about $2.4 billion of that is a run rate for our utilities. But obviously, we will update that with a little bit more clarity in June.", "In terms of the accretion around Oncor, we're obviously moving away from the metric we've used in the past, which was kind of provide a four-year average. But as part of our 2018 guidance, we thought it was appropriate that we could give you our expectation, obviously the closing date is uncertain. There's a few things moving around, but we've approximated the accretion at $0.20 this year. It could be a little bit more or a little bit less, but keep in mind that that also is for a partial year.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. The other thing, Julien, I would add to what Jeff said is that after our analyst conference last year, we already identified $1.9 billion of incremental CapEx spend. And that's detailed on slide 17 in your packet. And as you know, when we do our plans, we do it a little bit differently than others. We only put projects in those plans that we already have under contract or that are consistent with our regulated business approvals. So, since the analyst conference, we've identified more upside opportunity in terms of the $1.9 billion.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "But let me just specify this, if I may, the $0.20 of accretion you're talking about for this year and, obviously, it's a partial year, does that reflect the change implicitly higher versus the four-year average you previously articulated of $0.10 to $0.20, like on a go-forward basis, obviously lots of moving pieces?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Yeah, I appreciate your question. I think the four-year average was what we felt comfortable doing in the fall, because we have lots of moving pieces, Julien, right? You've got issues about when you sell your forwards at what price that the preferred actually transacts at in 2021, the date of closing, so there's a series of things involved here. On a going forward basis, now that we're putting Oncor in our guidance for 2018, that $0.20 number could be slightly larger or less than that. But there really isn't any fundamental change in terms of how Sempra is thinking about it, to the heart of your question.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Excellent. Thank you.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, first off, I also wanted to...", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Good morning, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Good morning. I definitely wanted to give a hearty congratulations to Rick and Steve, both. I've been doing this an awful long time and they make me look like I'm a newcomer and they've certainly always been kind of happy (27:33) professionals. So congratulations, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "That is quite a compliment. Yeah. That's quite a compliment.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I know that, Jeff, that you tried to wave us off a little bit here on page 10 when you say that you might need additional equity, but you want to cover that at the Analyst Day.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Right.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "So let me ask the question a little differently. How much does your FFO to debt metric come down, all things equal, given the $240 million per year less of tax sharing? And what are other things that may be impacting your FFO to debt metric? And what is the target that you're seeking to achieve in 2019 or 2020? And then what are the levers you can pull that would cause you to not need equity to make that number?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Okay. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Jeff, because I think the thing that you have to realize with us is different than other utilities is we have Cameron coming online in 2019 and a full year of operation in 2020. And the earnings from Cameron now with tax reform go up by $65 million to $75 million above the $300 million to $350 million we told you. So, one of the things that we're trying to do is work with the rating agencies to look at the significant event that occurs. And tax reform created one event, but that event is really reversed a lot when Cameron comes online in terms of our FFO to debt. And we started working with the credit rating agencies very extensively as we were dealing with the Oncor (29:29) transaction and kind of looking at how our portfolio changes over time, how the cash flows change over time and how our FFO to debt changes over time. And when Cameron comes on, there's significant improvement in our FFO to debt.", "Further, last year, when we did our plan for FFO to debt, we far exceeded the plan that we had and the cash flows from our ongoing operations were exceptional. So, one of the things that we're trying to do, and the credit rating agencies have been willing to work with us, is trying to look at this whole pattern over time that we have for our business and look at the way to maintain our credit ratings over that period of time. And part of that is looking at capital rotation. It's been the repatriation. It's looking at better cash flows from our existing businesses, which we achieved last year and all of those things coming together.", "And until we put all of those things together in a comprehensive way, I will tell you that's the sequence. And then to us, that's the sequence, and then you look at equity at the end of that. And so, that's the process we're going through right now. And I just want you to understand that that is the process and we'll be ready to go through that with you at the analyst meeting, because we're going through that right now with our board.", "So Jeff, do you want to add?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I think that, Greg, there were multiple parts to your question and between Debbie's response and mine, please let us know if this kind of satisfies most of what you're asking about. But to Debbie's point, we did extensive work with the rating agencies last fall. We have some more work to do this spring. But I think you recall that as we looked at the Oncor transaction, we had really forecasted to being able to hold investment-grade-plus ratings at both S&P and Fitch, with the likelihood that we would probably be investment grade flat at Moody's. I don't think our assessment has changed since then. Also as part of that work, we really were targeting to maintain those ratings and they were going to allow us some time to get to the optimal debt to equity ratio for the transaction. And you'll recall, we talked about that being completed by December of 2019.", "So to Debbie's point, relative to Oncor, not tax reform, we really had kind of a runway to work through the debt to equity ratio and how we balance that for Oncor through December of 2019. Now, as we finished 2017, Debbie's spot on, we really had very, very strong years on FFO to debt last year, one of our best years ever. We were well within the investment-grade-plus thresholds for all three agencies. But the point that you're on is that by reducing the tax-sharing payments, it is a negative for us. But to Debbie's point, that really doesn't start showing up until 2019, Greg, based upon how we're balanced in California and what our expectations are. And when you get to 2019, that's when you're starting to see the three trains of LNG go into production. So, I think there's a little bit of a timing mismatch in 2019. But we've got a plan that we're going to execute on with the agencies this spring. Debbie laid it out, the process we're going to go through. I'm quite comfortable that by the time we get to the analyst conference, we can provide a lot more detail about our expectations.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. That's directionally clear. I appreciate it and look forward to more details later. Thank you.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thank you, Greg.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Great. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Hey. First, congrats, Rick and Steve. Best of luck. And so, on the one technicality on the Oncor data and tax reform. How are you treating the debt issued for Oncor? Is that in your tax reform impact or that's just in the Oncor benefit?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Jeff.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "We think about that \u2013 I would just go through this with you really quickly, Steve. But as the starting point, you recall that interest in our utilities is largely excluded. The rest is subject to the 30% EBITDA limit. We certainly expect \u2013 I think this is part of what you're hearing in the call \u2013 to lower our parent debt over time. And as part of that process, we'll be allocating parent interest to our subsidiaries with a view that anything that's left over can be carried forward kind of given the strength of future cash flows from Cameron. But to your specific point, our view of the guidance thus far on acquisition debt is like Oncor, like we're talking about for Oncor, is expected to be excluded similar to the utilities.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Then on the repatriation of $4 billion, can that be done without asset sales or is that \u2013 embed some amount of asset sales in there?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "What we've looked at, as we said, for this year, about $500 million to come back of cash that we have offshore, know our (34:21) asset sales are part of that $500 million and then about $1.6 billion over the five-year plan period, which includes that $500 million and that doesn't include any asset sales. But the headroom up to $4 billion that we have prepared for would allow us down the line to sell assets or businesses. And to the extent that we had already covered the tax on that $4 billion, then they would not be taxed again. But in terms of our plan that we laid out, we don't have any asset sales currently in that, and that's the work that we're going to be looking at.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then just lastly, any updated color on the LNG market in terms of potential growth?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, as you can see in the media, it's turned quite positive and there's a lot of interest in the 2022-2023 period. I'll have Joe talk about each of our projects and kind of the interest in the buyers.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. Yeah, as you see as Debbie noted in the market and there was a nice comment from Shell yesterday, the market is getting tighter as the excess volumes are being taken up with improving demand. And also, we're seeing quite an uptick in oil prices, again making U.S. LNG very attractive, and the continuation of a current and future Henry Hub gas price continuing to fall. So, I think the bottom line here for us is, we have three projects that are in good shape, they're in permitting, and they're in marketing, and we feel really good about those.", "And let me just kind of remind you of what we have and what we're doing, because I think we're a company that actually has multiple projects and all of them we're excited about. So, I'm going to go in alphabetical order. So, read into it that we're staging them in some way. This is alphabetical. So at Cameron, I think that the expansion of Trains 4 and 5 are fully permitted at FERC and DOE. And so, it's a very valuable option for us and our partners, because it's a low-cost build. And our focus today is getting Trains 1 through 3 in service and completed.", "And now, the probable entry of Total is very positive for expansion, and you've heard their CEO come out and make it public that they are supportive of expanding the facility. And I've had a number of conversations with them on this topic. And so, we're anxious to keep that process moving. I think they hope to get it done by the middle of the year and they just have to work through all the consents.", "At ECA, the one that's just 40, 50 miles south of here, we have a proposed large-scale facility for 12 million tons. It received all of the major permits in Mexico in December. We today \u2013 because of market demand and a number of very interested parties who we received letters from expressing their interests and continuing conversations happening even yesterday and today in Asia, there's a lot of interest in us building a mid-scale facility sooner. And so we're looking at a 2.5 million ton facility that would fit on to the ECA site and would not preclude the larger facility from a footprint point of view.", "What we're doing now is evaluating a couple of things. One is, are we confident that we have the pipeline access without building any new pipelines to feed that mid-scale facility and are we absolutely confident that if we build the mid-scale facility we won't have problems making sure we have sufficient permitting to do the large scale and that would require of course a large pipeline back to the Permian. So that's ECA, we're very excited about ECA.", "And as well at Port Arthur, we have a very excellent location there. We've been working with Woodside now for a couple of years and we've created a really excellent project facility from a technical and gas supply perspective. It's going to be highly reliable and safe and economical, which is what the customers want. We think the LNG unit costs are going to be lower than at Cameron due to the optimization work we've done with Woodside. And again, we think that the market is good. We have the Heads of Agreement we signed with KOGAS last year and we're continuing to work with them and many other participants. And the marketing teams, as I said, are out in Asia and Europe all the time.", "So, I think it would be great if we're able to launch at least one of these projects, at least one of them, with HOA this year, followed probably by FID next year. And that puts the production into that window, that ideal window 2023-2024 as the supply/demand curve opens up. So, we're looking good and feeling good about it.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Couple of just nuts and bolty type questions. Just curious, California rate base, you all talked briefly on today's call about how tax reform could lead to incremental investment opportunities without it negatively impacting customer rates. Can you give a little bit more disclosure on what are the opportunity set areas you're thinking about?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Well, as you know, we just filed our rate case, Michael, and it was the first rate case that we've had at our utilities that uses the Risk Assessment mechanism, RAMP, as it's called, to identify and prioritize spending in our utilities. None of that is in our plan. As you know, when we do our financial plan, we take what our last rate case is. We look at the attrition levels that have been authorized, and that's how we plan going forward.", "So I think as we look at it, we had a pretty robust rate case request that was driven by this Risk Assessment mechanism. We think with the tax benefits that flow through customers, that will create a reduction in rates that hopefully will allow (40:30) the Commission to approve the kind of request that we have in our rate case.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. And when I look at the rate case docs, one of the things that hasn't happened yet is when you filed the case, bonus depreciation was still expected for the next couple of years. Obviously, with tax reform, that's gotten pulled out. Just curious, like if I just took your rate case request, how material is that to like your multiyear rate base views?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. What I have is just the impact in 2018 and 2019, because we had assumed bonus depreciation was going to be going away over the timeframe phasing out (41:05). So in 2018, it gives us about an extra $100 million of rate base, and then in 2019 about $200 million of rate base. But as I said, when we do our planning, we don't put any of the future years in the planning. We just use what we have authorized with the attrition. And when we do our five-year plans, we carry that out on that basis, and we do not put in the incremental request that we made.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. And I have one \u2013 and this maybe a Jeff question, one around Oncor, because you made the comments about no longer kind of anchoring to the $0.10 to $0.20 four-year average accretion. In your year-one accretion, you've kind of pegged at $0.20 or so, plus or minus a little bit. Just curious, are you seeing the potential to where Oncor \u2013 either due to synergies, due to growth projects, due to kind of the limited lag, due to the DCRF and TCOS, are you seeing where Oncor could even be more \u2013 significantly more accretive than when you first entered the transaction?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Michael, I appreciate the question. I mean, obviously, we've entered into our merger agreement back on August 21 and there were probably \u2013 I'm making the number up \u2013 30 different variables that impacted how we thought about the business economically. And as you went through the last six months, obviously, our stock price changed. But at the same time, they finished their rate case, right. So, you added a lot more certainty for them to finish their rate case in November. Their overall capital program has gone up. Our assessment of their NOL position had increased. We had forecasted last summer some contingent liabilities. That amount has declined over time.", "So there has been some puts and takes over the last six months, but I don't think we think about the business fundamentally any different. We think, from a strategic standpoint, it gives us reach and scale into what we think is probably the most important energy market in the country. I think that the accretion numbers we've given you for 2018 is really reflective of how we felt about the transaction previously. So, it's not like we're looking at it fundamentally different. We're just kind of zeroing in now with less variables.", "You still have things out there, Michael, about what price does you preferred convert at, when do you unwind some of your equity forwards and at time it is, and what the timing of closing is. But we feel pretty comfortable about the transaction generally from an accretion standpoint. But probably more than anything else, we're excited about it means in terms of giving us a really nice growth platform in the Gulf.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. And if you don't mind, one more. What's your target, either FFO to debt or debt to EBITDA? Like, where do you want to be, even if it's a couple of years post-Cameron or like what's your long-term aspiration?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I think the way that I would speak to that is I think we're very comfortable that we want to be an investment-grade-plus company. We indicated earlier on the call that we were well within those thresholds for all three agencies earlier in the year. I think if you look back at our Q4 results, we've got a debt ratio of roughly 56%. We've got about $19 million (44:23) of total consolidated debt. And across our five-year planning period, we feel more comfortable at or below 50% from a debt ratio standpoint. And I think that we'll continue to work on our FFO to debt.", "The challenge you have with that question, Michael, is the overall business risk profile is also changing. So, that comes lower as you add a quality asset, like Oncor. And similarly, the quality of the cash flows from Cameron impacts that. So, conceptually, the overall business risk profile should be declining at the same time that you're working through these competing items of lower cash tax-sharing payments with the addition of Cameron coming online here in the next 18 months.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Debbie. And Rick, Steve, congratulations, guys.", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thank you, Michael.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Shar Pourreza, please go ahead, with Guggenheim Partners.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners", "Hey, guys.", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Hi.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners", "So just sort of thinking about, again, just incremental accretion opportunities for Oncor and, again, not to preempt things. But with deal closure sort of around the corner, what are your thoughts on looking at acquiring the TTI piece? And also, a little bit more curious, as you manage this business over the next few months or years, do you see sort of an opportunity to request a removal of the ring-fencing provisions in time, and maybe look at recapitalizing, especially in light of the structures your peers are afforded in and out of the space (45:51)?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yes. Let me just address the TTI portion first. And, as we have expressed multiple times, we think TTI's interests are very much aligned with our interests. So, we are happy to have them as a 20% owner. But should they decide that they wanted to exit, we definitely would want to have an opportunity to consider the purchase of their share. And so that we think we are fine with the 80% ownership and TTI as a partner. We've met with them on a couple of occasions. They have the same kinds of interests about growing that business. There's no disconnect between ourselves and them in terms of how they look at that business. Of course, over time, it would be great if they decided that they wanted to exit, that we would have an opportunity to step in and own 100% of what we think is a preeminent company.", "In terms of the growth opportunities on Oncor and the ring-fence, we have accepted those terms with the parties. And what we think we need to do is we need to show those parties over time, through our exceptional management of this company in conjunction with the Oncor management, that those kinds of protections are not going to be needed over time and that we can live with all of them. We spent a lot of time looking at them. We don't think that they're going to impact materially how we do our business with Oncor. However, none of the other utilities in Texas have them. And we don't like the idea of having something that other parties in the state wouldn't have on the long term.", "But I don't think that as we look at those elements, I don't think it will change at all how these businesses perform. And the management of Oncor, the board of Oncor, we all have great alignment in terms of how this business needs to grow. And we see great growth potential in the Texas market and in Oncor itself. So, we are very happy that we're getting close to closing this transaction. We think it will be a tremendous investment for Sempra shareholders over time. And if nothing changes, we can live with it. But over time, if we can make some changes to the structure, we're more than willing to do that.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners", "That's helpful. And then just as you guys think of projects like ECA, can you sort of give us any thoughts on what you're seeing in Mexico and sort of these potential reforms and the impact to IEnova assuming like AMLO wins. It's clearly kind of been a bare argument around the story. So, what are you sort of seeing with boots on the ground there?", "Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. In fact, I'm going to have Joe talk about that, because he was in Mexico just a few days ago and there was a lot of discussion about Mexican elections, about NAFTA and about our investments there. And I will just say we feel pretty darn comfortable with where we are and what Mexico needs going forward, and not thinking that there's going to be a lot of change. But Joe can add some more color from being there.", "Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy", "Sure. Yeah. I think the overall theme is, our business strategy there, in Mexico, at IEnova, are with Mexico's efforts to reduce the cost of electricity and fuel to all of its consumers. And we believe that those efforts will continue and not change, regardless of which candidate is elected to be the next President of Mexico. And I think it's too early to tell who will win that. But we feel really good about the business. I'll come back to ECA in a second. And we're doing what we can to help the consumers in Mexico.", "And the one thing to remind yourself is that it requires two-thirds vote in the Houses and 51% of the states to overturn the energy reform. That's a high hurdle. But remember, the most important thing for you to take away from this is almost everything we've done in Mexico didn't require energy reform. We were doing the pipelines. We had the regas terminal. We had our utility businesses. Almost everything we've done down there didn't require energy reform and wouldn't be upset by that.", "So, it's something we don't want to see happen, we don't think will happen, and we're very involved. I've been quite involved with Dennis Arriola in our Washington office and people in Mexico on NAFTA and reminding all of the secretaries in each of the three countries how important it is. We'll see where it goes.", "But go back to ECA for a minute. Look, you might remember that PEMEX has been, for the last couple of years, our partner in trying to help develop the ECA site, and now we have a new agreement with them where they're not going to participate anymore. But going forward, IEnova and my LNG team, we're working together on trying to turn that into a liquefaction facility.", "However, remember, until 2028, we have great contracts for the regas terminal, and we want to keep those in place. They provide substantial EBITDA and earnings for us. We think there's a good opportunity here. And as I said, we just got the permits in December for the large-scale facility, and we do not see any problem with those despite whatever the election results are.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners", "Got it. And then just maybe one question for Jeff. On the asset sales, the $1.6 billion, can you just maybe help narrow down what the asset and maybe the geographic footprint, or is it sort of \u2013 with sort of the tax reform advantage of repatriating, should we think about more of those asset sales will come from foreign investments?", "Jeffrey W. Martin - Sempra Energy", "Thank you. I think the key part of your question is that both \u2013 how we think about repatriation and capital rotation. These things will go together this spring in terms of the analysis we're going to do. But I think this is a process on capital rotation, you'll recall that we do periodically. If you think back to 2016, we decided to divest Rockies Express and Mobile Gas. We went through a very similar process then, and our strategy really, as Debbie has articulated in the past, is we look at asset by asset whether it's meeting our return expectations, number one. And number two, does it fit into our portfolio as we continue to try to high-grade our investments around things where we have a lot of transparency to really visible growth. So, I think that's the process we'll follow. It's something we've done before. And I think between now and the analyst conference, we'll be able to optimize both, both the repatriation piece as well as capital rotation. Trevor, you want to anything?", "Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy", "Yeah. I just want to say that the $1.6 billion that we have that we talked about really is not part of an asset sale. That's just the repatriation of cash that's offshore right now, and the ongoing earnings coming from those businesses.
