All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, May. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.'s fiscal first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website as well.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the IR section of Visa's website. For historical non-GAAP pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Jack, thank you, and good afternoon or good evening to everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be with all of you. I just completed my first quarter at Visa, and past my two-month mark as the Chief Executive Officer. I think, as many of you know, I've been a board member since early 2014, so I've been involved in the business and was a party in approving the company's strategy and priorities. I also understand the majority of the opportunities and challenges around the world. My objective from day one has been to make this CEO transition at Visa seamless for our clients, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders.", "I have no big plans to change our strategy in the short-term, but as a key player in a dynamic payments ecosystem, we certainly have to be prepared as necessary to adapt to our thinking as facts and circumstances change. Over the last couple of months, I've spent the majority of my time traveling to meet our valued clients, regulatory personnel and talented employees. During this time, I met with or talked to over 50 clients. I've also visited with regulators or government officials in nine countries and visited 12 of our global offices. I have to say it's been exhilarating and enjoyable. It has also reinforced my belief in our great global brand and the first-class group of clients that we have globally.", "Let me begin by sharing a few early observations since I joined the Visa team. Then I'll highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter and close with some thoughts around our strategic pillars as we move forward. First, I would say, we have a fantastic leadership team. I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with them and working with them on a day in and day out basis. I will also tell you that we have a talented group of employees after visiting with a number of them in our offices around the globe. We need to continue to foster a healthy culture that tracks, retains and develops the best talent to maintain this high level of company performance.", "Second, we certainly have strong relationships with our issuer clients, our acquirer clients and the merchant community of clients, and we're constantly looking for ways to build upon those. It's been very valuable for me to hear their perspectives on Visa and how we can be a better partner in addressing their business needs going forward. We need to identify areas where we can remove friction from the process, and enabling digital payments as we pursue partnerships. At the same time, we recognize that this industry is very competitive, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve in many markets around the world.", "Third, we're in a growth industry, and there's a huge opportunity in front of us. The global opportunity to digitize cash and check is enormous. We have a vibrant core business in developed regions with even more growth opportunities in the international and emerging markets with low penetration rates. Governments and emerging middle classes are leading the way to digitize more payments in developing countries, while e-commerce is displacing cash and check in developed countries. Through our focus on technological innovation and partnership development, Visa is well positioned for sustained growth going forward.", "As a market leader in payments technology, we're enabling new forms of digital commerce and supporting the new businesses in mobile payments, the Internet of Things, data security, and the sharing economy. Our global network connects over 16,000 financial institutions to over 44 million merchants, with strong commercial partnerships built over many years, and a brand that's recognized by consumers for acceptance, security and convenience. I'm gratified to see that the business strength and fundamentals that I knew as a board member continue to be realized in our financial results.", "With that, let me highlight some of these now. So in the fiscal quarter just ended, we saw a healthy overall growth in terms of payment volume, cross-border commerce, transactions, revenue and earnings leverage as the business performed better than our internal expectations. We grew net revenue by 25% and adjusted EPS by 23% versus prior year's adjusted results. Transaction growth, strong cross-border activity, higher currency volatility, and client incentive delays all contributed to our revenue outperformance.", "This is the second full quarter with Visa Europe in the results, which makes it a little more complicated, but Vasant will take time later to cover the financial results in greater detail. Our operational metrics are improving, and we're on track to meet our financial goals. In terms of co-brand partnerships, issuer renewals and other competitive deals, they are a normal course of business, and as usual, we've had very good success in the last quarter. We have a lot of momentum in the business and have exciting days ahead of us.", "We're executing on our 2017 operating plan, and are pleased with the progress to date. When I look out longer term, we remain committed to our strategy in the six guiding pillars, three of which I look at as foundational, and three of which are keys to growth. The foundational elements of our strategy are first and foremost to retain and attract the best people. In my mind, and based on my experience, success starts there. Winning teams and organizations have the best people, so we need to build upon the solid foundation and high performing culture we have here at Visa.", "We continue to strive to be an employer of choice where we can constantly attract the best talent, develop our people, and recognize their achievements as we are clearly doing excellent and wonderful things here. Second is transforming technology. We want to constantly be on the leading edge and push the pace of innovation. As part of extending our network and enabling easier access, we're pushing toward open access software for our clients and partners. We're providing an open platform for developers to access our APIs to quickly launch new products and experiences.", "We're adding technical resources in many locations around the world, and also building a European innovation center in the UK that will open at the end of this month. The third foundational element is championing security. It is an imperative that there is a high level of trust in the payments ecosystem, and we are committed to be an industry leader when it comes to security. One way we're doing that is through tokenization. We continue to make excellent progress with Visa Token Service, which is now live in 27 countries, and more than 1,300 financial institution partners are participating globally. We've enabled launches of many financial institutions' wallets, as well as the various pays in several additional countries in this past quarter.", "Now, let me turn to the three growth elements of the strategy, the first being expanding access to our network and services globally. Expanding and providing access to our network drives value for our clients and partners, consumers, merchants and governments. Around the world, we're developing supporting new products and methods of acceptance, while recognizing local market conditions. Through these efforts, we have provided payment accounts to countless numbers of people who previously didn't have access to the formal financial system.", "Second, growth element of our strategy is deepening partnerships. Partnerships are critical in the payments world, and we strive to be the best possible partner we can be to enable growth opportunities for all parties in the ecosystem. We need to continue to build close relationships with our issuing partners. Likewise, it is very important that we work hard and demonstrate a commitment to our acquirers and the merchant community in each market, and find ways to deliver additional value there. Being a trusted partner is a key to our business success. So we always want to look to strengthen these relationships, and we will continue to do just that.", "And the third element is digital expansion. E-commerce enabled by mobile and other form factors is a significant opportunity, and we are definitely investing behind it. As payments move from the physical to digital world, we're leading the way in developing solutions for our clients, our partners and consumers. One great example of this is Visa Checkout. We now have over 18 million consumer accounts in 23 countries, and over 1,500 financial institutional partners participating around the world. More than 300,000 online merchants have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $173 billion in addressable volume.", "Another key area for Visa is the acceleration of international markets. The integration of Visa Europe is tracking well. It's still in the early innings, but we're encouraged by the progress and see meaningful growth opportunities. During the quarter, we continued our focus on local market priorities alongside client engagement. The vast majority of our payments volume in Europe remains under contract. The European market continues to represent a large opportunity to displace cash, and we are accelerating digital innovation in Europe by continuing to rollout our token service in several markets as well as supporting many digital wallets.", "A number of people have asked about the China market opportunity. Visa remains committed to China for the long-term, and we want to deepen our partnerships with our clients and partners to advance economic growth. We look forward to the opportunity to formally submit our license application, however we're still awaiting additional clarifications from the government before we can apply. It's our intent to move very quickly to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around the timelines for their decision in granting licenses. The move to a more cashless economy in India also represents a large opportunity.", "Concurrent with other measures, the new government has implemented measures to incent merchants and consumers to move to digital payments. These new measures include capped POS terminal charges, no POS import tax and duties, and in the last quarter we've seen nearly 75% increase in payments volume in India, and more than twice the number of processed transactions. We're working with a number of key stakeholders to sustain the momentum to drive digital payments in the Indian economy.", "Examples include working with issuers to raise awareness and drive debit activation. We're also working with acquirers and merchants on digital acceptance solutions like mVisa to rapidly expand acceptance, and with key government bodies to facilitate longer term ecosystem growth. It is early days, but we're excited about the opportunity to expand electronic payments to consumers. Let me now share some thoughts on managing our capital and delivering shareholder value. Our number one priority with capital is to identify and find ways to grow our business. This can come organically or through acquisitions.", "One example of the latter is the acquisition of CardinalCommerce which closed yesterday. This acquisition helps our clients and merchant partners to accelerate digital payments in commerce by improving online payment security. It builds on our strength in the sector, and augments issuer services and our CyberSource capabilities. In this dynamic payments ecosystem, we need to invest to drive future growth and maintain our market-leading position. Second, we will continue to deliver value by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In this last fiscal quarter, we returned nearly $2.2 billion, consisting of $1.8 billion through share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends.", "As we've stated before, we have accelerated our share repurchases to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe acquisition. We will continue to be prudent as we think about ways of managing and allocating our capital. Lastly, we plan to maintain a healthy dialogue and good relationships with our investor community. I hope to meet and spend time with many of you as we move through the year. And to that end, we are in the planning stages to hold an Investor Day in June, so we will come back to you shortly once the dates and locations are confirmed. So as we begin this New Year, I'm excited about the many opportunities ahead. We're off to a really good start in our fiscal first quarter. I feel great about the future of Visa.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Thank you, Al. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start. First quarter revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations driven by accelerating fundamentals, which more than offset the drag from exchange rate shifts. On a GAAP basis, fiscal first quarter net revenues were up 25%, and EPS up 7%. Net income for the first quarter was $2.1 billion, and EPS $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusting for the $255 million non-cash gain in last year's first quarter from the write-off of the Visa Europe put liability, EPS was up 23%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points.", "There were four key drivers of our Q1 outperformance; first, constant dollar payment volume growth stepped up between 1 to 2 percentage points in most geographies; second, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, the cross-border recovery accelerated by 2 percentage points globally from 10% to 12%, once again the acceleration was broad-based; third, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, process transaction growth picked up by 1 point from 12% to 13%, driven significantly by India as well as the U.S.; fourth, timing of client incentives and delays in expenses added almost $0.03 to our Q1 results. Strong business fundamentals more than offset the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a weakening euro. The balance between strong business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts will drive our results as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal year 2017.", "A couple of other points to note before I get into the details of our Q1 results and our outlook for the year. We did not issue $2 billion in debt as we had planned. We did issue $567 million in commercial paper to fund our stock buyback and operating cash needs. We have over $8 billion of offshore cash, which could be repatriated if it can be done tax efficiently. We will wait to see what the new administration's plans for permitting cash repatriation are before we issue a longer-term debt. In parallel, we continue to work on other strategies to bring cash back to the U.S. Until there's clarity on this front, we plan to issue commercial paper or short-term debt to fund our buyback and other onshore cash needs. We bought back 22.3 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $79.77 for $1.8 billion in the first quarter. We have $3.9 billion remaining in our stock buyback authorization.", "Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter; U.S. payments volumes grew 12.4% in Q1 as credit grew 20.2% helped by Costco and USAA. U.S. debit grew 4.6% helped by USAA debit conversion, but hurt by Interlink volumes. Interlink volumes were down due to lapping a significant win in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Excluding Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth rate stepped up by 3 points due to USAA and rising gas prices. Gas prices added approximately 1 point to both credit and debit payment volume growth in the U.S.", "As reported, Q1 international payment volumes grew 70.5% in constant dollars. The step-down in the growth rate from the last quarter is a result of the exclusion of co-badge volumes in Europe. As you know, effective June 9, 2016, Article 8 of the EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment networks cannot impose reporting requirement or the obligation to pay fees on payment transactions where their payment brand is present, but their network is not used. Prior to this regulation, Visa collected a small service fee in a few countries, particularly France, on domestic payment transactions where Visa cards are co-badged with a domestic network.", "Clients in Europe continue to report co-badge volume through the quarter ended September 2016. However, effective the December 2016 quarter, Visa co-badge volumes in Europe are no longer included in our reported payment volumes. Item 2 in our Operational Performance Data package will help you adjust for this change. As you can see, excluding co-badge volume, European payment volume growth stepped up from 7% last quarter to 9%. There was strength across Europe and especially in the UK. Payment volume growth rate in Asia was up 1.6 percentage points driven by India, Japan and Australia.", "Our CEMEA region growth rate was higher by over 3 points helped by the Middle East and some improvement in Africa. The only region with a slowdown in growth was Latin America, pulled down by continuing weakness in Brazil. Adding in Europe to last year's payment volumes and adjusting for co-badge volumes, in other words on a comparable and normalized basis, constant dollar global payment volume growth accelerated by 1.5 percentage points in Q1 versus the last quarter. On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 140% driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was 12%, up 2 points from the last quarter.", "This information is provided in Item 3 of our Operational Performance Data package. U.S. cross-border growth in constant dollars hit double-digits for the first time since the first quarter of 2014. The strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from the U.S., especially into Mexico, Canada and the UK. Our large U.S. acquired business was stable, benefiting from commerce in from Canada and parts of Latin America. The weak pound is driving significant inbound commerce into the UK from all parts of the globe. Euro zone cross-border growth rates remained healthy helped by a weakening euro. Cross-border commerce was strong across most of Asia, especially outbound from Australia and Southeast Asia.", "Other high growth corridors were outbound commerce from Russia and Eastern Europe. Overall, the cross-border business was an important contributor to our Q1 outperformance. On a reported basis, global process transactions grew 44%, driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, global process transactions grew 13%, up 1 point from the last quarter. U.S. process transactions grew 11% due to Costco and USAA. Demonetization in India drove the increase in international process transaction growth. European process transactions were stable. Through January 28, U.S. payment volumes are up almost 13% in constant dollars. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and process transaction growth was 14%.", "As you can see, first quarter growth trends remain intact so far in Q2. A quick review of Q1 financial results. Service revenues grew 17%. Service revenue growth was helped by the announced price increase on U.S. acquired debit card service fees, offset by negative currency translation impact. Service revenue growth is lower than payment volume growth we reported in the September quarter, reflecting the fact that service revenue yields are substantially lower in Europe than in the legacy Visa business. Data processing revenues grew 28%. Once again, transaction revenue growth is lower than process transaction growth reflecting the lower yield on European process transaction relative to the legacy Visa business.", "India demonetization doubled transaction volumes, but did not contribute much to revenues in Q1. As you may be aware, in response to a request from the Indian Government, Visa voluntarily charged no fees for processing through December 31, 2016. International revenues grew 44%. This is up from the September quarter growth rate driven by cross-border volume acceleration, higher than average currency volatility, offset by an unfavorable exchange rate impact. Other revenues grew 2%. Other revenues no longer include Visa Europe license fees.", "Client incentives came in well below our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. This is all due to timing of deals being done in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Many of these renewals will be executed in the second quarter, shifting these client incentive payments from the first quarter into the second quarter. Lower client incentives due to delayed deals added approximately $0.02 to our EPS in Q1. Expenses grew 16% due to the inclusion of Visa Europe. There were some shifts in marketing and technology spending to upcoming quarters.", "In addition, as Europe completed the consultation process, new hiring, growth projects and integration activities were modestly delayed. Delayed expenses added $0.01 to the first quarter EPS. These expenses will be incurred through the balance of the year. Our tax rate was 30.5%, driving EPS of $0.86, up 23% on an adjusted basis. As we look ahead, two significant countervailing trends will drive our results; strong business momentum, especially cross-border growth is a tailwind; the strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the Euro are headwinds. The cross-border recovery is broad-based and accelerated in the first quarter. We hope this will be sustained. This is a higher yielding revenue stream which improves our revenue mix.", "Continued strength of the dollar is a risk to monitor. Treasury volatility staying above long-term averages as it did in the first quarter will also help. The broad acceleration in payment volumes globally is another reason for optimism. The counter trend is exchange rates. Based on spot rates and the forward curve, the dollar has strengthened around 4% versus our major currencies since September. The stronger dollar is a stiffer headwind than we expected. Our hedging program will offset some of the negative impact. The euro has weakened almost 5% versus the dollar since September. Since we did not own Visa Europe until late June, we are not hedged on our euro exposure.", "In addition, the euro is now a functional currency for us, and we can only do economic hedges which could add volatility rather than dampen it. As such, we may choose to stay unhedged on our euro exposure. The weakening of the euro will hurt Europe results as reported in dollars more than we expected last September. This countertrend of favorable business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts drive our fiscal year 2017 outlook.", "For the second quarter, we are assuming payment volume momentum will be sustained. The strong dollar could cause some moderation in cross-border growth. Client incentive spend will step up with the deals that are shifting into the second quarter from the first quarter. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be well within our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Expense growth rates are expected to be higher than the first quarter as we ramp up spending in Europe, and delayed initiatives in technology and marketing move into the second quarter.", "For the full year of fiscal year 2017, we are reaffirming the ranges we previously provided for nominal revenue and EPS growth. We expect that stronger business fundamentals will offset stiffer currency headwinds. We have increased the likely currency translation drag on our reported revenue and EPS growth rates by 1 point versus prior estimates. While client incentives were lower than expected in the first quarter, we expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be very much in the 20.5% to 21.5% range for the year. Other elements of our outlook for the year, operating margins and tax rates, remain unchanged. We continue to work on tax and repatriation strategies related to the Visa Europe acquisition as we've told you before.", "If and when we are able to execute a tax re-organization, we will let you know what its impact will be on future tax rates and cash debt management plans. Visa Europe revenue and operating income are tracking well despite the negative impact of the weaker euro. Integration plans are modestly behind schedule due to a longer consultation process. With the employee consultation process now complete, the re-organization is being executed. Technology integration planning is on track. Discussions continue with clients to ensure that our pricing stays competitive post the elimination of rebates, as well as to extend existing contracts.", "Even as this process is underway, it is important to note that the vast majority of our volume in Europe remains under contract. In summary, fiscal year 2017 is off to a good start. Strong business fundamentals are helping overcome unfavorable exchange rates. We hope this trend will continue through the year.", "With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Vasant. At this time, May, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. First question is from Bob Napoli. Your line is now open.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much. Al, congratulations on a very nice quarter. You really have accelerated momentum since you've become CEO. So congratulations on that.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Team effort, but thank you, Bob.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "The question is on client incentives. Just the change in client incentives from last year to this year, what percentage of that is from the integration \u2013 from the Visa Europe acquisition versus other items like Costco or just general business conditions? And do you expect, as we look to fiscal 2018-2019, to see that percentage continue to increase?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah, as we said on our call last quarter, we said that it was roughly half due to Europe, and some of it is how the accounting works when you remove rebates and replace them with client incentives. And the rest was driven by Costco, USAA, and also renewals that we expect this year. So nothing has changed much on those fronts.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "As far as the longer-term outlook?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Sorry?", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Just the trend into 2018. Sorry.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Well, I think it's too early to talk about that. We'll certainly get into all that as we get to later in the year and talk about next year. But as you know, we're tracking below our range in the first quarter, so you should assume that it'll catch up in future quarters this year.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Bob.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We have from KBW, Sanjay Sakhrani. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. I was wondering if we could get more color on where you guys are with the pricing initiatives in Europe for the year.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "We're moving ahead with plans we had. And some of it, as we've told you before, we don't plan to announce them per se in calls like these. Certainly, in the market in Europe, people are aware of what we have done. As we said in our comments, we are engaged with all our issuers and acquirers in Europe on all these issues. There are ongoing discussions. We're happy with how things are going. And as far as that's concerned, we're very much on track in terms of everything we wanted to do.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We have from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, guys. So just in light of the longer consultation period in Europe and a little bit of the delay in the integration, is 2% to 3% EPS accretion from Visa Europe still the right number?", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Yes, I think that's certainly what we're continuing to target, Jason.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "I'm sorry, we have George Mihalos. Your line is open, from Cowen.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks. Nice to see the encouraging trends pretty much across the globe. Just curious within the U.S. market, I know there's a number of deals that are still ramping up. But sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing an acceleration on the part of your issuers in trying to push more credit products and maybe the volume you're seeing again on sort of a same store sales basis ex-Costco and USAA?", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "I would say that, given the continued amount of attention reward products are getting, we're certainly seeing that our issuers are very focused on the credit card segment for sure.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah, in general, credit growth rates when you normalize for all things that are, as you said, adds to our business, the underlying growth trend is higher in credit than debit, and is roughly stable quarter-over-quarter.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please, May.", "Operator", "Next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Yes. Hi. Thanks. I was hoping with all the noise in the numbers, you could help us see through to some level of organic growth for the European franchise. Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "We've tried to do our best to give you the business drivers. So if you go to our Operational Performance package, what you'll see is that European payment volumes grew 2 points faster than they did last quarter. So it was 7% growth last quarter, 9% this quarter, and that is Item 2 in the Operational Performance Data. So you can see that. And then in the commentary, we talked about cross-border being quite strong in Europe. We're seeing a huge amount of inbound commerce into the UK, certainly helped by the pound. Generally speaking, cross-border across Europe is quite strong, helped by the weakening euro. Europe is definitely a beneficiary of a lot of inbound commerce. And then in terms of transactions, I think you heard us say in our comments that transaction growth rates in Europe was stable. We're moving very well in terms of all the other actions we want to take in Europe as it relates to costs and so on. So all-in-all, as Al said earlier, we feel very good about both Europe's financial performance and also the accretion that we anticipated this year. We are on track to do as well as or better than we had assumed we would his year.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Craig. Next question.", "Operator", "Next is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Just a little bit of a follow up on that and then on the incentive side again. First, can you help us understand, I mean, is there a way that you can just kind of tell us what the pro forma revenue growth rate would have been had you owned Visa Europe this time last year? And then part of your guidance obviously seems predicated on, as you said Vasant, incentives being notably higher than the run rate in both fourth quarter and now the first quarter was the same as a percentage of growth. I guess just, I mean, you had USAA and Costco both in there. I know a lot of the European banks were done already. I guess, just why would it increase at that level? Thanks again, guys.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Darrin, I'll start with it, there were a couple of deals that we thought would close in the first quarter that have just drifted into the second quarter, and a couple of them are big deals outside of the United States. And so we have a pretty good insight to what the second quarter is going to look like based on the fact that these deals are either have closed or were at the very last level of red lining the deal. So we have pretty good insight. So I think the guidance that you heard from Vasant is good guidance. In terms of the first part of your question, we're not in a position to start getting into a lot of the detail on Visa Europe individually. I think we're very excited to have moved to kind of a one Visa concept that as quickly as we possibly can. We're going to be happy to be able to talk about it on a total global company basis.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to sort of divide up the report, the financial reports into, this is Visa Europe's performance separately. We try to help you as much as we could in the business drivers to give you a feel for how Europe is performing and how the business is actually performing on an organic basis if you adjust for Europe. And then I think the other question you asked was, why would we expect incentives to be higher this year than the fourth quarter of last year. It's a variety of reasons, some of which we walked through on the call last time. Someway it has to do with how the accounting for the rebates worked post the acquisition of Visa Europe. It's Visa Europe coming into our numbers. It's Costco and USAA being in there for the full year. And it's some of these renewals that we were anticipating this year that Al mentioned. So what we told you is what we still expect, and that's why we indicated that what you saw in the first quarter was a result of some delays, but the overall full-year expectation for client incentives does not change.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, May.", "Operator", "Next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you. I'll ask on the debit routing modification that caught a lot of news when it was announced in December. With you I guess taking up guidance here doesn't seem to be a big issue from a P&L standpoint. Just curious if you can maybe comment on how impactful that modification or clarification has been or could be to your P&L. Thanks.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Per the request of the FTC, we made the clarification. But I think that for the most part we were acting in the appropriate fashion. But we see very little impact of any meaningful level on the business whatsoever.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, May.", "Operator", "Next is from Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. So a quick question on India. You talked about significantly increasing transactions but not driving much revenue, and part of that was the function of the Indian Government asking you guys to kind of keep prices subdued for a little period of time. I'm wondering, as you think about the guidance that you just gave us, are you assuming more normalized pricing in that horizon, and if not, when would you expect that to somewhat normalize in your opinion? Thanks.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "I think we're assuming some pricing in that model. I don't think we're \u2013 I would say, we're being fairly conservative in what we expect to be able to gain in terms of revenue. This is, I think for us very importantly, and strategically this is a build opportunity that the government really has put out there in front of us. And so in my mind, at this point I'm much more focused on capitalizing on this opportunity and investing heavily behind driving both awareness for consumers and incentive for merchants to get signed up. There's only a very fractional amount of the merchant community in India that is enabled today to be able to accept electronic or digitized payments, and we want to try to get that number up as much as we possibly can. So I think when you consider the economics of the investments we'll make in India, plus a fairly conservative pricing, it's certainly not going to be a market in this fiscal year that's going to drive a lot of profit for us. But I think, it's a great year for us to make sure that we do everything we can in one of the two largest population countries in the world to get as good a position as we can to help us over the next decade.", "Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We have one from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good afternoon. My question also relates to Europe. I'm hoping you might be able or willing to compare and contrast the go-to-market strategy with the issuers, and what you're doing or what you plan to do in Europe differs from the U.S. You kind of pointed out that you've got a very incentive driven market here in the U.S. and you're able \u2013 and you've been very successful in terms of using the interchange framework here to drive a lot of issuer wins. Can you maybe just help us understand how you're attacking Europe differently?", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "So I think, Ken, Europe is almost a number of different segments in and of itself. I mean, the Europe for us right now is hugely dominated by the UK where we have most of the debit market taken up. Then there's four or five other markets across the EU where we have a reasonable amount of business. And then there's a number of big economies, certainly Germany being one example, where it's still a heavy cash society, where I think we've got a lot of opportunity in the medium to longer term to see more of commerce digitized or in some form of electronic form. Europe is also different than the United States in terms of processing, where there are in certain markets domestic processing schemes. And we've got a strategy to try to win more processing volume in Europe as well.", "So we're engaging, I would say, hopefully, what I believe to be a thoughtful segmented approach with different issuers and different acquirers on a country-by-country basis because each of these countries is different, and having spent most of my life as an issuer on the issuing side of the business, I know full well that the issuing business is really a local consumer business, and you've got to figure out the right strategy on a market-by-market basis. So we're not going to have kind of a pan-European strategy. It's really going to be a market-by-market strategy within Europe.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. Al, I just wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind commenting on two areas that you did not explicitly mentioned in the strategy that you laid out; one is Visa's expansion into adjacent markets like remittance or potentially into B2B, and what your plans are there; and then, secondly, when you mentioned partnerships, you did not call out the big tech firms like Apple, PayPal, Alipay, et cetera. And so I'm just curious if you have a comment there. Thanks.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "On the latter, Lisa, I think I maybe shorthanded it, but I did say that we're working with all the pays, and so it's all of those pays. And we're in different stages of relationship with all of them. But obviously they're increasingly important people in the payments ecosystem as mobile devices become an important form factor in the digital world. So absolutely we're working with them. Look, I think there's a lot of vectors for growth for Visa, and the whole commercial space and disbursement of different kinds and business-to-business kinds of payments are very much on our radar screen. We have a group of people headed by a very senior person who's dedicated to this space now. We're not as strong a player as we'd like to be, but we are stacked up and spending a lot of time on this issue. And it's something that we do want to get a stronger position in the whole commercial and B2B space.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next is from Moshe Katri, Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.", "Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. One, can we get an update on the PayPal agreement in terms of where we are? And then in that context, going back to Visa Europe, have we seen any change in issuer attrition while you're renewing your book there? Thanks a lot.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Well, in terms of the latter question first, I think either in mine or Vasant's remarks, we talked about the fact that a lot of our issuer volume in Visa Europe is under contract. So we actually bought Visa Europe at a time where we've got a pretty good book of business that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, that said, as I said in my remarks, I'm very, very much a client-focused person, and we're going to work hard with every single one of our clients in Europe as well as around the world. But we do have a lot of good long-term relationships locked up. In terms of PayPal, I'd say that everything is progressing as planned. Our issuer clients who are very important to us, obviously, are engaged with PayPal, and they're working to migrate customers off of ACH back onto their cards. PayPal has been executing marketing campaigns and changes in their user experience to make it much easier for Visa card holders to pay with their Visa card, and to make it their default payment option.", "Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next question from Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. My question, Vasant, is just on the use of CP and short-term debt rather than the debt issuance that you had planned. What motivated that decision, particularly given that the rate environment presumably would be pretty good still for term debt?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Well, the fact is that we have offshore cash. And let's say we issue $2 billion of long-term debt, and we're able to repatriate somewhere in the region of $8 billion of offshore cash either because there's a change in the rules that allows it to happen tax efficiently, or because we are able to, as part of our \u2013 some thoughts and ideas we have on the re-organization in Europe, we're able to repatriate cash. We will have more cash than we need to keep for settlement guarantees and all that. And that excess cash is available. So that's the reason to wait a bit and see whether we want to use our own cash rather than lock in more long-term debt. I mean, this is something we monitor on a regular basis, and if there's any changes on that front, we'll certainly let you now.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Eric. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. I just want to ask in the U.S. debit market, you guys talked about some headwinds due to the PIN debit routing choices. Is that a shift from Interlink to other EFT networks, or are you guys seeing or think you're going to see a switch in the market towards more PIN versus Signature? And then just quickly, secondly on cross-border volume, what are you guys expecting exactly in the guidance, continue at these elevated levels or to fall back down?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "So on the first question, what we talked about was really that our Signature Debit business actually stepped up in growth rate by 3 points this quarter, and that's driven a lot by USAA. So really all we were referring to was switch away from our PIN debit volume, which would be Interlink volume. Some of it is because the Interlink volume declined this quarter as it did last quarter, some of which we told you was because we were lapping a significant win from the fourth quarter of 2015, and then some of it was because volume moved to other PIN debit networks. So it was all around volumes away from our PIN debit network, or hard comparisons for our PIN debit volumes versus prior years. So that was the answer on that one. What was the other question?", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Cross-border volumes.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Oh yes, cross-border volume, I think as I said in my comments, for the first 28 days of January, cross-border volume growth was certainly holding up. But the dollar has strengthened, so our go- forward assumptions assume that the cross-border growth rate is healthy but perhaps a little bit of a moderation in the rate of growth than what we saw in the first quarter. So we'll wait and see.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "From Jason Deleeuw, Piper Jaffray.", "Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks. I was hoping to get an update on Visa Checkout, what some of the current investments are right now on the consumer merchant side. And then what's the longer-term vision for Visa Checkout and how does that fit in with the partnerships with the other pays? Thank you.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Well, we think of Visa Checkout as a platform, and it's all part of us trying to make sure that we're a leader in terms of bringing potential solutions to the marketplace. We feel very good about the fact that we now are up to 18 million users signed up for Visa Checkout. It happens to also be a very active base of customers in terms of usage of Visa Checkout. We are facilitating more of our issuer clients to put their products side-by-side, embedded within Visa Checkout. And at this stage, the pays are out there obviously doing their thing as well, and we're going to continue to work with them. I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to shake out. My personal view is that there are too many wallets out there. Consumers are not going to ultimately want to have 50 wallets, and we're not necessarily anxious to be in the wallet business per se, but we're anxious to take advantage of us being a trusted acceptance mark in the payments eco-space, and want to be able to make sure that we're taking a leading position in establishing Visa as a trusted mark, and as an important partner to our issuers in terms of them trying to establish as much volume as they can get in the digital space.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, May.", "Operator", "Next from Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the impact broadly that you expect from the Trump administration and other Congressional policies, both in terms of tax policy, regulatory impacts, or other impacts, and maybe talk about some of the largest positive or largest potentially negative things you can see in the future.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "Jim, I think, it's too early to tell. I mean, we're barely two weeks into this presidency. And while the President has been active with executive orders, I think that as things start to settle down and we get into more specific policies and his cabinet is confirmed and in place and the legislature gets going, I think it remains to be seen what happens. I will tell you this, that we have a world-class group of government relations people who are already fully engaged as much as we can in the relevant conversations in Washington. But I think there's things that relate to trade, relate to taxes, all of which could play into our business. But I honestly just think it's too early to start to speculate. And we're certainly not building anything into our plans positively or negatively for that matter related to any policies that might come out. But I can assure you that we're watching it very closely.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim. May, next question.", "Operator", "From James Faucette, Morgan Stanley.", "James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. Wanted to kind of follow up on that. You talked about having visited with a lot of customers as well as government officials, et cetera, around the world since you've taken on the CEO role. Can you talk and summarize a little bit what the particular regulators were asking from Visa, and kind of what their objectives are, and how Visa can help fulfill those? And I guess, kind of what's happened in India as it creates an interesting lens through which to view that. So maybe elaborate a little bit on some of those relations, et cetera. Thanks.", "Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.", "So I've talked to regulators in both very developed markets as well as regulators in developing and emerging markets, and I think the content and tenor of the conversations is a bit different depending upon who you talk to. I mean, there are governments around the world who very much are seeking a close partnership with us. Their desire is learning how they can be helped in moving to a much more of a cashless society, how they can get many more of the people in their countries actually engaged in the financial system, how there could be greater financial literacy. And so in those particular cases, I would say that we're trying to take a very active role, and in some cases a very proactive role, in helping shape how the government thinks about what steps they ought to take. Including, by the way, in some cases working with governments to have them be a role model by making sure that they are moving away from paper in favor of a digitized world.", "So for example, in Egypt, instead of vouchers being handed out, giving people prepaid cards so that they could in fact begin to start to have an experience with plastic. And what that does is it automatically starts setting up and incenting a whole merchant network to get built out as these people have to have a place to go, be able to spend their money that's on these prepaid cards, and merchants in this particular example who are involved in food and beverage, for instance, want to be able to get their fair share of that volume so they're very quickly incented to get to a point where they can accept plastic and be signed up as a merchant. In more developed countries, there are countries where the ship has sailed, and they've made decision on interchange as an example. Probably Australia and Europe being two real examples there where, I think, now it's just a matter of what does that mean and how does that play out for issuers and consumers in those markets.", "I think, there are countries that I've talked to where there's pressure on both sides of, say, the finance ministers in countries where some of the merchant coalitions want to see lower interchange, but in markets, for example, where reward propositions are big on plastic, or on whatever form of payment vehicle it is, the consumer is going to get hurt in terms of those programs if interchange is lowered, because it's a two-sided market. The economics have to \u2013 there's only so much economics, and people will do what they'll have to do to make sure that they stay economically viable. So I think there's a number of markets where truthfully the government is trying to stay out of it and kind of let the free market system take over. And I think, in general, there's markets where the regulators are taking a very, very active role and in other cases I think a much more passive role. Again, often quite different depending on the specific country we're talking about.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, James. May, at this time we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "We have Tom McCrohan from CLSA.", "Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. You've covered so much ground on the call, I'll just ask a simple question. The total integration cost of $450 million to $500 million over the next three years, any change to that. Thank you.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah, we said it was $80 million this year. We'll wait and see how things go and give you any updates as we get towards the end of the year on future outlook. But at this point, really we wouldn't say anything different about the future. We expect that we will spend the $80 million we thought we would spend this year. Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations. And when we have a set date for our June Investor Day, we will put that out in the public domain.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s CEO; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, as you can see from the earnings press release, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a four-for-one stock split, each Class A stockholder of record. At the close of business on February 13, 2015 will receive three additional shares for every share held on the Record Date. In the form of a 100% stock dividend and trading will began on a split adjusted basis on March 19, 2015.", "Due to the structure of the various classes, holders of Class B and C shares will not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for the Class B and C shares will be adjusted after the stock split, so that the Class B and C stockholders will retain the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split.", "Second callout involves FX. Since our last earnings call, the U.S dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our key currencies. Based on the December 31, forward exchange rate, we project an incremental 50 basis points negative impact on our full-year revenue growth.", "Third call out relates to cross-border activity. Cross-border volumes softened 2 percentage points in the September quarter -- in the December quarter to 8% growth in constant dollars and a further 1 percentage point to 7% through the 21st of January.", "Once again, FX is an important contributor as a stronger event anticipated U.S dollar has led to substantially reduce travel into the U.S from Europe, Canada, and Latin America, notably Brazil. Beyond FX, the severe economic challenges in Russia have also been a notable drag on cross-border results.", "In total, our outlook for cross-border volume driven revenue growth in fiscal 2015 is approximately a half percentage point less than when we began the year. Partially offsetting these headwinds has been a strong rebound in currency volatility versus product quarters. The improvement has sustained from September through early January and has stepped up even further due to recent Central Bank actions by the Swiss and the Canadians and was further aided by the recent elections in Greece.", "Given the unpredictability of volatility, we will continue to be appropriately conservative in our outlook on how sustainable this is for the balance of the fiscal year. For full-year revenue growth, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance of low double-digit constant dollar growth with a negative two percentage points of foreign exchange impact, but would position expectations at the lower end of that range.", "Looking ahead to Q2, we expect this quarter to be impacted the most by FX as well as by lower gas prices. And to therefore deliver a growth rate lower than originally anticipated, but still in the mid single-digit range. From there we expect net revenue growth rates to building Q3 reaching double-digits in Q4.", "We are reaffirming client incentives in a range of 17.5% to 18.5% of gross revenue. While Q1 came in at 17.4%, we expect Q2 to Q4 to run at somewhat higher levels given the pacing of deal activity for the balance of the year.", "We are also reaffirming our full-year EPS guidance of mid teens. That said, remember, when projecting Q2 results, in Q2 of last year Visa booked a sizable tax benefit which included both one-time and ongoing tax impacts. And we will be lapping an unusually low level of client incentives in the prior year.", "Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares during the December quarter at an average price per share of $259 and change. Through January 27th, we purchased an additional 2.5 million shares for a total of 5.6 million shares fiscal year-to-date at an average price of $258 leaving us with an open to buy of 4.2 million -- 4.2 billion. Of note, all share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have now been completed.", "Now let's turn to the numbers. I'll cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the first fiscal quarter followed by our results through January 21. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter.", "Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%. The U.S grew 10% and international grew 13%, both at similar levels to the September ending quarter. Drilling down further, in the December quarter U.S credit grew 14%, a 1 percentage point improvement compared to Q4.", "During the quarter, we experienced account conversions and deconversions, the net effect of which positively impacted credit payment volume by a little more than 2 percentage points by the end of Q1, the vast majority of account conversions will have taken place.", "Turning to U.S debit, it grew at 7% in the December quarter, flat to the September quarter. More recently through January 21st, U.S payment volume growth was 9% while U.S credit grew 12% and debit grew 6%. In terms of fuel, significantly lower gas prices had a negative 1 percentage point effect on U.S payment volume growth in the quarter with a disproportionate impact in December and with a bigger impact on debit than credit.", "Global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, down from the 10% rate in the September quarter. The U.S grew 4% and international grew 9% in constant dollars. Through January 21 cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with a U.S growth rate of 6% and an international growth rate of 7%, further decelerating from the December levels.", "The under performing travel corridors referenced earlier, in combination with weaker growth in Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine were the primary culprits. Travel within Asia remains strong.", "Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 17.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a 10% increase over the prior year period. The U.S grew 9% while international delivered 14% growth. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 10% with a U.S growth rate of 9% and an international growth rate of 13%.", "Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.4 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year driven primarily by solid growth globally across all revenue categories. And as mentioned earlier, was negatively impacted by approximately two points of foreign currency headwinds.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, Services revenue was $1.5 billion, up 8% over the prior year and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa transactions both in the U.S and internationally. International transaction revenue was up 9% to $970 million as increased currency volatility countered negative impacts from FX.", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 6% from the prior year primarily related to higher personnel, marketing and other expenses which support our growth strategies and product initiatives.", "Operating margin was 66% for the first quarter in line with our annual guidance of mid 60s. Our effective tax rate was 30.6% within our guidance range of low 30s. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 616 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 619 million.", "Finally, for completeness our full-year guidance metrics for revenue growth, client incentive, operating margin, tax rate, EPS growth and free cash flow remain unchanged.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Thank you very much, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I\u2019m just going to start by telling you, I think that we as a management team are quite pleased with our results. We continue to produce strong and consistent results in the global economic environment which is providing more headwinds than tailwinds.", "Consumers spend continues at reasonable levels, but it is not accelerating and we expect gas prices to continue to be a near-term headwind. Geopolitical tensions are playing a more meaningful role in our results as they\u2019ve at different times during our past. Having said that, our growth is still strong and well in excess of consumer spending growth as the movement from cash to electronic payments continues regardless of economic and geopolitical events.", "As most of you probably know, we\u2019ve put forth a proposal in this year\u2019s proxy to amend our corporate charter that would position us to effect a stock split at an appropriate time and at the discretion of our Board of Directors. As you can see from the announcement today the proposal did indeed pass and our Board of Directors declared a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend.", "This action in addition to our dividend increase and our previously announced share purchase -- repurchase program are all indicators of our confidence in our future. Our long-term outlook continues to be bright as our investments in digital payments provide growing opportunities for us.", "Let me make a couple of comments now about our first quarter financial results. As Byron said, it was another strong quarter driven by solid underlying payment volumes in processed transactions globally. As expected, operating revenue grew 7% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, while expenses increased 6% and earnings per share registered a healthy 15% growth.", "Global payment volume grew 11% flat to last quarter and still robust. Solid rates in the U.S of 10% were bolstered by international at 13%, again no change from the previous quarter and still robust in spite of everything that is transpiring across the globe. U.S growth moderated slightly in the month of January driven by further declines in gas prices. And as Byron mentioned, our U.S results benefited from conversions as we converted significantly more accounts on to a platform than were converted away from us.", "Let me just cover a few topical items now. First, a few words about the U.S holiday spending season. The holiday season spending patterns evolved differently than prior years. Growth was stronger going into Thanksgiving than we\u2019ve seen in the past and it tailed off through the month of December, but a significant driver was the continuing decrease in gasoline prices.", "Having said that, our rate of growth was higher this year than last year including the decrease in gas prices. We also look at the rate of growth year-over-year excluding conversions and gas prices to gauge the underlying economic environment and it looks to be about flat.", "On that topic, I want to talk a little bit more about gas for a second. First, to put the drop into context, U.S fuel prices are down approximately 30% since June. This drop amounts to approximately $60 per month for the average consumer. According to our surveys, approximately 50% of the savings consumers are seeing is being saved, 25% is being used to pay down debt and approximately 25% is being spent in other discretionary categories. These categories include grocery, clothing, and restaurants. This is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in our own spend data.", "As we look forward, we\u2019d anticipate the savings will accumulate and ultimately we\u2019d see more spent in the discretionary categories including higher ticket items such as home improvement, electronics, and travel and entertainment.", "Third cross-border volume moderated to 8% from 10% in the prior quarter. We see the effect of geopolitical tensions here and the strong dollar and the corridors affected are not surprising as Byron pointed out.", "Fourth, the rebound in currency volatility is material. It\u2019s obviously welcomed and not surprising given what's going on in the world. The moderation in cross-border continued into the current quarter, as has increased currency volatility.", "On the expense front, we continue to manage expenses judiciously and while we continue to appropriately invest in all of our long-term initiatives, there are defensive measures we can and will take if needed in the face of any slowing economic scenario. We're not doing this yet, but we remain prepared.", "Let me turn my attention now just to say a couple of words about our competitive position. We love our competitive position in the marketplace. We are the industry leader, but this alone doesn't give us comfort. We know that we are the target for others, traditional and non-traditional. Thus far, we\u2019re comforted by the fact that we continue to maintain our share in an intelligent way for our shareholders.", "We are laser focused on investing to drive cash to electronic payments, partnering with those who will drive commerce in the digital world and creating platforms to embed ourselves in that digital commerce, Visa Checkout, Visa Token Services, Visa Digital Solutions and enabling Apple Pay. These are things that we\u2019ve done so far and there is much more to come.", "Let me turn now and make a couple of comments and updates regarding the legal and regulatory front. On the domestic front, we're certainly pleased with the recent outcome of the supreme Courts decision not to hear the National Association of Convenient Stores\u2019 appeal against the Federal Reserve Board. The decision is an important step in bringing clarity to the debit interchange landscape. We are hopeful this will encourage all parties to work more closely to address areas of mutual interest.", "Speaking more broadly to the merchant litigation, we made considerable progress in settling the MDL opt out cases. Through the end of the first quarter and to date in January, we paid out approximately $335 million to opt out merchants. We are optimistic that we will continue to see good progress. Additionally, we had approximately 1,100 requests from smaller retailers to opt back into the class. They will be compensated accordingly under the terms of the Class Agreement.", "In Russia, we continue to work with the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian National Payment Card System to transition our domestic processing to their network. We continue to estimate that 2015 full-year impact to be $50 million.", "A quick update on Visa Checkout. As I mentioned last quarter, Visa Checkout saw excellent initial traction in the early fall, which is accelerated during our first fiscal quarter, capped off by the holiday shopping season. This was driven by strong media campaign in conjunction with our NFL sponsorship as well as individual merchant media collaboration. Thus far we have conducted 24 co-marketing campaigns with some great merchant partners.", "Visa Checkout now has over 240 financial institution partners across the United States, Canada and Australia, which account for almost 50% of our global e-commerce volume. Several issuers are also participating in marketing programs, including e-mail and online campaigns. To date we have over 3 million registered users and consumers can now use Visa Checkout to stop at over 110 e-commerce retailers representing over 42 billion in addressable volume.", "We continue to see good success with Apple Pay, and with all involved parties actively promoting the service either independently or in concert with each other. As Apple reported yesterday, about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring their customers Apple Pay. To date 43 of our issuing partners have enrolled in our tokenization services. These issuers collectively represent 75% of our aggregate U.S payment volume and over 500 of our clients have signed the Apple Pay contract and we are actively working with them to enable the service.", "As importantly the token technology employed here sets the standard for other digital experiences and you will see others come to market over the course of the next year. As we gauge the success, I agree with Apple\u2019s assessment that its early days of the excitement we see is encouraging. It will take some time to build out the NFC acceptance infrastructure for Apple Pay and others. That is happening now and will continue as merchants upgrade their terminals to accept chip enabled cards. I would also note that few if any chip enabled terminals are shipped that don\u2019t also contain NFC functionality.", "More specifically on EMV chip cards, we continue to work closely with all industry players and are very optimistic that the adoption of chip cards will continue to accelerate over 2015. Based on the Payment Security Task Force protection -- projections, we expect to see well over a half a billion chip cards enabled in consumer\u2019s hands by the end of 2015 and roughly half of all terminals of surveyed acquirers will be activated by year-end. We expect that by the end of 2017, roughly 70% of all cards in all terminals will be chip enabled.", "Moving on to the emerging and evolving technologies like host card emulation. In the fall, we launched our sandbox environment for Visa Digital Solutions. We have several clients and partners that have been actively developing new mobile and digital services in our sandbox. Next week our Visa Digital Solutions platform will launch and be live in production. We expect that several of our clients and partners will launch the new services over the coming months.", "Lastly, we are putting the finishing touches on several other initiatives that we will be announcing during the upcoming Mobile World Congress meeting in early March, so stay tuned.", "Just to close, we are very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. As we indicated last quarter, while we expect volumes to remain relatively strong, we are expecting revenues to be softer in the first half of the year including the second quarter, which we expect to be the trough. The back half of the year should improve as gas prices stabilize and the effect of our previously announced pricing changes become effective.", "It will continue to be a very exciting time in the payments arena and I fully believe that Visa will continue to be in a leadership position not only in terms of growing our payment volumes and processed transactions, but as importantly driving new technologies and ways to pay as we work in concert with our issuers, acquirers, merchants, and other parties.", "With that, Byron and I are ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Darrin Peller", "Nice job on the quarter. Just want to touch first on what you were mentioning around FX volatility levels. As I think, Byron, you mentioned earlier they clearly have increased. Just to be clear, not including that in your outlook at least you're including -- are you including the levels that we have seen recently? And just kind of going forward with that or are you including lower levels? And maybe can you give us the size and sort of magnitude of what kind of impact it could mean if you were to sort of extrapolate off the card levels of volatility for the rest of the year on your cross-border volume?", "Byron Pollitt", "So we\u2019ve included our forward projection of FX rates based on the December 31 forwards. So the numbers that we quoted, the guidance that we have reaffirmed, fully reflect the most current thinking and data we\u2019ve using the forward exchange rates of December 31. With regards to volatility, which is another aspect of FX, the projection assumes some continuation of what we\u2019ve seen, but we\u2019re -- as indicated in my remarks, cautious here with regards to the balance of the year and that this is an area that it is very difficult to forecast. So clearly a good start to the year with regards to volatility it is trending, it has performed above the 10 year medium which we referred to, I believe on our last earnings call. But this is an area that goes up and down, so it\u2019s unlike FX and its impacts on our translations which we\u2019ve projected using the December forwards throughout the year with volatility we\u2019re forecasting a bit closer in and taking out what we believe is a conservative posture in the second half.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question David?", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Hi, guys. So the strong dollar obviously as you highlighted has had that negative impact on U.S inbound cross-border travel from some of the key international card. So I just wanted to get your take on whether or not you think that the 7% cross-border volume number through the first three weeks of January will prove to be the trough for the year, because I know you do have some easier comparisons coming up in the March and June quarters in particular.", "Byron Pollitt", "That one is really hard. We have -- we are projecting off our trending, but the dollar is continuing to strengthen and that strengthening dollar is fundamental to our forecast for the balance of the year in terms of its impact on volume and subsequent impact on revenue.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question David?", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Togut", "Thank you. Could you provide any clarity you might have Charlie on the rules that are governing the opening of China's domestic payments market and when this might be material for Visa?", "Charles W. Scharf", "I guess couple of things first. First I just want to be clear; China is an important market for us today. We don't compete domestically for transactions, but we\u2019ve very close relationships with banks in China where we issue cards that are used outside of China. So to the extent and at the appropriate time when the Chinese marketplace opens we're not starting from ground Zero relative to building relationships within China. Relative to the timing of the open, we really unfortunately cannot provide any additional clarity. We know what you know, which is that the Chinese government made the statement that they will allow domestic competition that they\u2019re in the process of writing those rules and my guess is we'll see them when you see them and we continue to work with our Chinese partners and meet with the government. But relative to when the market will open, what the rules will look like and how meaningful it would be, we really don't know. I would just remind you, well I know a lot of you know this fact, but when they\u2019ve opened the market up in other industries that are industries somewhat like ours, it generally takes a period of time, sometimes quite a significant period of time before it's going to become something significant for the Company.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please?", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your question.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Have you seen any notable difference in the impact of lower gas prices on affluent consumers versus the general population? And maybe on the comments that you\u2019ve made about cross-border, could you kind of address whether you're seeing any early signs of more U.S travel abroad given the strengthening of the U.S dollar and if so, is any of that factored into your outlook?", "Byron Pollitt", "What we see -- let me take the second one first. What we see for U.S and abroad given the strong dollar is that it has sustained. What we haven\u2019t seen is a -- any sort of spike in U.S travel abroad, which you might hypothesize what happened, given the stronger dollar. But what we\u2019ve seen is a sustaining of healthy growth rates on outbound U.S travel. With regards to gas and impact on affluent, as I mentioned in my remarks, gasoline spend is more debit rated for us than credit. We\u2019ve seen very little impact on spent at the credit level, which is where you would expect more of the affluent to participate. We have seen some impact on debit, which is where you would expect the less affluent to play in greater numbers. So as Charlie talked about, there has been a clear noticeable reduction in debit spend as it relates to gas in the U.S., a portion of which have been redistributed to other categories. But the bulk of which has been for at least for the moment based on our surveys being banked [ph] in the savings category. And just keep in mind that the average of $60 a month -- $60 a month in its own way doesn\u2019t change -- it's unlikely that people change their behavior. I mean if you boil it down to people filling up their tanks once a week, at that point you're down to $15 a week, how are you going to spend differently? So the places that we\u2019re seeing it, which I mentioned are the grocery, fast foods, QSRs especially architecture places where you would see that kind of additional dollar amount. But as I said from a survey is, we know that 50% of its being saved. That amount of money accumulates. People start to see that thy have additional money and then over a period of time we\u2019ll potentially buy higher ticket items is what we would anticipate.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Don Fandetti", "Yes, Charlie, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the rollout of tokenization for online, and when you think it could also rollout internationally around Apple Pay. And then lastly, have you seen increased discussions from other smartphone manufacturers and players post to Apple Pay?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Sure. On our tokenization efforts we are very actively working with issuers in other parts of the world, and would expect to see some tokenized solutions in the marketplace this calendar year. On the topic of other people whether its handset manufacturers or others there is a very, very active dialogue that\u2019s going on that was happening, but I think the work that Apple has done and winding up in-market with their solution, it certainly accelerated peoples thinking. And we\u2019ve been very, very clear relative to ourselves which is, we are very excited about what Apple is doing. We think it\u2019s a very elegant solution that we are thrilled with our participation in. But we want to enable as many scalable solutions that have wonderful customer interfaces that adhere to the highest security standards. And we would expect to see a series of those in the next couple of quarters come to market.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, David.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "I just have one more on FX. How did the hedges affect next year, I mean, did they differ some of the impact that we might have seen if you weren\u2019t hedged this year into next year. And then just one data point question, do you know that sum total of those that are still opt out in the merchant litigation? Thank you.", "Byron Pollitt", "With regards to the hedges, the answer is, yes. Beginning with the month of October which was, it\u2019s the beginning of our fiscal year. We start doing 12 months forecasts out and start layering in hedges 12 months out. So, January -- this is January, so the hedges we put on this month will be for -- will cover, throughout the end of January we will have the hedges in place that will cover the first four months of next years fiscal year. And I\u2019d say for better or for worse. If the dollar continues to strengthen, then the hedges will provide benefit and if it goes the other way, the opposite, and remember the objective here is to simply dampen, not eliminate. We are not insulated from FX. What we try and do with the hedges is flatten out somewhat the volatility. And I might also add, that what we solve through in hedges is not revenue, its actually operating income. So, we hedge again certain risk point levels by currency against our operating income, which means we use the expenses in other currencies as a natural hedge and then we put on our transactional hedges beyond the natural hedge of the expense we incur in the non-U.S. currencies.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "The next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.", "Moshe Katri", "Hey, guys. Can you talk a bit about tokenization? Where are we in terms of introducing on the service to banks, and some of the feedback, and then maybe you can talk a bit about, how should we think about this looking into next year? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "So, those financial institutions that I referenced in my opening remarks are all using our token services for Apple Pay. And as I said, we\u2019re working with another 500 or so institutions here currently to get them involved in Apple Pay and therefore using our to tokenization service because that is a prerequisite for participating in Apple Pay. As I said before, we continue to work with issuers around the world and expect to see more tokenized solutions as time goes on. What was the second part of the question?", "Byron Pollitt", "There was a second part that I didn\u2019t answer to Sanjay\u2019s question. So let me just, if I could let me just add that in real quick. The question was, I believe how much opt outs remain in the MDL litigation. That number we don\u2019t have, but immediately accessible. But to be hopeful here, we think it\u2019s better to think about it in terms of the payment volume represented by the opt-outs. Charlie tell you that, to date we have settled and actually paid out of our escrow $335 million or so, out of an escrow that was $1.5 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year. Think of that as settling out a little over 20% of the payment volume represented by the opt-outs before these payments began.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please.", "Robert Napoli", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to get an update on CyberSource if I could and, the trends in that business what you\u2019re doing to improve that business and, who maybe -- what competitors are you finding most difficult as far as loosing market share?", "Byron Pollitt", "So, on CyberSource we had a good holiday season. We grew at -- transactions grew at about 16%, that\u2019s up from 12% in the prior reporting period. We honestly is that, which we have mentioned on prior calls, we missed an investment cycle maybe to in this product, we are rapidly reinvesting, re-platforming to enable much better client service as transactions accelerate in terms of capacity utilization. And so, this is a business we\u2019re very committed to. It\u2019s been an excellent vertical extension of our business model and we remain very vested in bringing the platform to world class levels again and to accelerate the growth rates above which we have even most recently been experiencing.", "Charles W. Scharf", "And the only thing I would get -- just add a couple of things to it. Number one is, I mean we think about CyberSource in two different ways. We think about it as a, how is it doing as a standalone business? And we think about how is CyberSource helping the rest of Visa. As Byron mentioned on the standalone business, we\u2019ve been very clear that we did miss an investment cycle here. We had a very clear roadmap internally that both relates to customer facing improvements such as time to onboard and things like that, as well as some infrastructure changes that we\u2019re making. That\u2019s a roadmap of call it a year or so, and that\u2019s how long it will take us. So we would expect to see some volatility from the existing client base as we go through those changes but it\u2019s the right thing for us for the long-term. Separately from us and this gets to just the overall point for us with CyberSource. CyberSource is an extremely important part of the company. When we talk about leveraging merchant relationships and talk about wanting to build broader capabilities and things that, conversations that we\u2019re having in the marketplace, in order to do that CyberSource is just a wonderful addition for us to be able to be a partner to either enable those conversations or to be part of those conversations. And quite frankly for us to start from scratch on merchant relationships is very, very different than to be able to start with a CyberSource inside the company.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, David.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "James Schneider", "Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Relative to your commentary on incentives, I believe last time you had talked about incentives being front half loaded in the first part of the fiscal year. And I think today you said that you now expect them to be, to trend upwards as we go through the year. Has something changed in terms of deals pushed out or additional deals signed. Maybe give us some color on the cadence of those incentives as we go through the year?", "Byron Pollitt", "One of the things we\u2019ve learned over the past seven years is that, we have been doing earnings calls is that incentives is very difficult to project quarter-by-quarter. We have gotten pretty good at projecting it on the full year basis. And so, with every passing quarter we get smarter about the deals that close, and the deals that are taking longer to close that we thought might close. And so, nothing has occurred that has changed our outlook for the year. But we are reaffirming the lumpiness of incentives and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing here. We have one quarter in the bag and three to go and we\u2019re very comfortable with our guidance of 17% to 18.5% and we expect the three out-quarters to run at a higher rate than what you saw in the recently completed Q1.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Smitti Srethapramote", "Thank you. At your analyst day a year and half ago, you guys estimated that there would be 38 million mobile plant cell [ph] locations by 2017. Just wondering if you guys can give us an update in terms of how things have played out versus your initial expectations and are there any particular geographies where you\u2019ve seen acceptance increased noticeably due to mPOS?", "Byron Pollitt", "That\u2019s a good question, and I have the number, but I don\u2019t have it now in terms of how many mPOS locations there are. But the number is growing extraordinarily quickly. The last number -- Canada, Australia and other places, I mean the numbers that I saw were several quarters ago, actually probably its almost a year ago, we\u2019re probably at $5 million and I believe the number was over $10 million, the last time I checked. So, I mean, the growth is happening and in addition to just the mPOS devices out there, usage is what's extraordinarily important. So, we can make sure we get you that number and next time we talk publicly we\u2019ll make sure we\u2019ll mention it, so everyone has it.", "Jack Carsky", "Our next question, David.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Great, thanks. Charlie, it sounds like you said -- I think you said you can protect the bottom line of, if the macro deteriorates here. Can you elaborate, was that an expense comment and maybe can you just give us an update on the timing of the CFO search? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Sure. So, on the first one, listen I think my comments are quite simple which is, the economic environment in terms of what we\u2019re seeing with the strengthening dollar obviously makes our jobs more difficult. The point of what I was trying to say was, we are not changing our spending patterns, the projects we have underway based upon what we\u2019re seeing in the world today. We\u2019re not laying people off. We\u2019re not even thinking about doing anything like that. We\u2019re continuing to push forward to grow the company because we think that\u2019s the right long-term thing for us to do given the opportunity, and we think as Byron just went through, we think we\u2019ll continue to perform as a company. Having said that, we also just always remind ourselves that like any company you can always tighten up and you can always go through and prioritize and figure out what the most important thing to do is and you really have to do every last thing. And if we got particularly noticed that what we are seeing in the world would affect us in any kind of meaningful way beyond what we expected. We have the ability to do that. And we\u2019re not contemplating that and even if we did that, we would assume -- assume we would do it in an intelligent way that still allows us to invest in the right thing. So, the point is if we had to and if we thought it was prudent we could reduce the expense base of the company or certainly slow the expense growth but not something we\u2019re contemplating doing right now. And on the CFO search, I would hope -- I hope we have something to report shortly on that.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Bryan Keane", "Hi, guys. Just a couple of clarifications. I guess, Charlie what's the strategy for rolling out tokenization for browser based ecommerce? I guess, I was under the impression, this spring you guys will be rolling something out. I\u2019m just curious what the plans are there? And then, secondly Byron on FX, just given your comments on some of the hedges in the rolling off of some hedges. Should we think start modeling in a couple of point impact for fiscal year \u201916? Thanks so much.", "Charles W. Scharf", "So, on the first piece. In the spring of this year we will have some tokenized solutions in the marketplace for some browser enabled solutions.", "Byron Pollitt", "Okay. And on the FX, Bryan I wish I had a crystal ball. But let me relay the following circumstance which is the dilemma. When we gave foreign exchange guidance on the fourth quarter call we had a full year of hedges in place. Three months later, we\u2019re saying that the interim FX developments have negatively impacted our revenue growth by about 50 basis points. So, within three months of our last projection of FX we\u2019re off 50 basis points in the year it was hedged. So, we are not yet ready to talk about FY \u201916. That said, your projection of just how strong, how much further strengthening the U.S. dollar can achieve. How long it can sustain at this level before the inevitable cycle goes back the other way, is as good a guess as ours will be. In terms of impact, we\u2019re using as our best proxy the December 31, forward exchange rates.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, David.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great, thanks. Could you talk a little bit, I mean you mentioned during the opening comments about the holiday spending being a little different kind of debit spending being affected by gasoline. Are there trends that you think that will be persisting throughout 2015. I know we\u2019ve got some differences in the way tax refunds are going to be paid this year. I mean any other things that we should be aware of as we go through \u201915 particularly in the U.S. and keeping that stuff in mind?", "Byron Pollitt", "I guess, because we spend a lot of time tearing apart everything that we can find about the holiday spend numbers. The stuff -- the things I talked about were the most important for us isolating the conversion, so you get a real underlying view of spend. We have talked about the impact of gas and what we would expect to be the ongoing impact of gas. The only thing which we didn\u2019t cover here which we spend a lot of time talking about is ecommerce volume. Ecommerce was extraordinarily strong during the holiday season which is a continuation of what we have seen. Growth rates of ecommerce were two to three times what they were in the physical world. And for us, we like that, because cash doesn\u2019t work in the online world. And so, we have got a much higher participation rate in the ecommerce world than we do in the face to face world. Other than that nothing is coming to mind, Moshe.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, David.", "Operator", "The next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Maurer", "Yes, good evening. Thanks. First, could you give us a little bit of commentary on the impact that pricing changes that we have seen reported by the acquirers will contribute to your guidance on revenue growth? And secondly, we have seen EVMCo produce a draft of 3DS 2.0 based on Visa and MasterCard\u2019s work indicating that you\u2019ll be able to take additional authentication metrics into account starting in, at the beginning of \u201916. Does this also mean that what we\u2019ll get a card holder present like interchange tier to show up at time as well? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me take the first one. As we described on our fourth quarter call, we have a number of price adjustments that will take place in the second half, U.S. acquiring card service fees in April roughly two basis points, about 40 basis points on U.S. acquiring ISA again in that April timeframe, these get faced in. So, no impact in Q2, fiscal Q2, a beginning in fiscal Q3, full impact in Q4. So as you think about modeling it on a fiscal year basis we would expect our lowest revenue growth rate to be in the upcoming Q2, and then as the price adjustments start to kick in delving in Q3 and then by Q4 having an impact that would bring us to double digit revenue growth in fiscal Q4. Put that altogether and we are still reaffirming the guidance we gave in Q4 for the full year, but today largely because of FX at the lower end of that range.", "Byron Pollitt", "And then on your second question, I wouldn\u2019t relate those two dates. The work we\u2019re doing on 3D secure, in re-looking at the rates as we said. As with tokenized solutions being in the marketplace, we are constantly looking at what makes sense, constantly looking at the fraud, looking at the value added. And if it makes sense for us at some point to do something different within a change rates, we\u2019ll do it. But right now, we have no specific plans to talk about.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Timothy Willi", "Thanks and good afternoon. Charlie, just going back to your comments, I guess throughout the class action that is starting to settle with those that opted out et cetera. Any comments you would have just around sort of the tone of collaboration, with yourself and the retailers would sort of come to the end of this, and just trying that into anything we should think about maybe longer term around rebates and incentives and the mix that would move more towards retailers versus banks, if there is anything we should consider there?", "Charles W. Scharf", "No, on the first piece, listen I think -- our relationships with merchants as we have said are extraordinarily important to us. Being able to settle these lawsuits is a good thing. It puts that conversation behind us and it an opportunity to talk about things that we can do together, the most obvious thing that I can talk about Visa Checkout. The idea of merchants advertising along side us, promoting something isn\u2019t something that would even have been contemplated a couple of years ago. And they are doing it because -- not because they like us as people, they\u2019re doing it because we have a product which they believe is good for them. When you\u2019re buying something in the ecommerce space, you put something in the card to checkout. What you want as a retailer is you want someone to actually pay for that. And for us to be able to bring a solution to market which has a much higher close rate, which is easy to use, where we can leverage our brand jointly, and ultimately by the way bring new customers to them is something that excites them. And so, those are the kinds of conversations that are very different that we\u2019re able to have today. Not everyone is in that bucket, but that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. We would like to have that kind of partnership with everyone. And as I said before, that\u2019s something that is going to play out over a long period of time. We know we have to prove to merchants that we can show up with solutions that are better for them, as I went through at Visa Checkout. As we announced a quarter or two ago with something called Visa Transaction Advisors, where we\u2019ve now turned out broaden analytics talents towards helping oil companies reduce fraud at the fuel pumps through risk scoring that we do on a real time basis for them. So, I would describe it as, it\u2019s encouraging, but it\u2019s a long-term discussion where there have been proof points in the marketplace and you\u2019ll start seeing them over a period of time.", "Byron Pollitt", "And with regards to incentives, Tim, the main action as it relates to incentives doesn\u2019t really today, it has little to do with MDL and much more to do with outrank in debit related to routing. That said going forward, I think as we increasingly introduce new product initiatives, new services and where we want to accelerate trial and adoption, we\u2019re prepared to put some incentives on the table to help crime in the pump and as a way of crafting a smart market entry using the merchants as a launch partner for services that will be good for the network and all its participants.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.", "Lisa Ellis", "[Indiscernible] at the end. Thanks guys. Hey, Charlie I just wanted to follow-up on the point you made on ecommerce. First, could you give an update on the mix of revenue or volume you\u2019re seeing to the e-commerce channel and the card mix as well? And then, second question is about the fed strategy paper on approving the U.S payment system that was released on Monday. I\u2019d love just your thoughts on that, the level of involvement or engagement you guys have had with the fed and how you see it impacting your business?", "Byron Pollitt", "So on the first don\u2019t have a lot of color. We\u2019ve not release numbers like that either by product or exactly what the mix is, but obviously given you what the relative growth rates are and so hopefully that\u2019s helpful. On the fed paper, first of all, we\u2019re very actively involved with the fed as many others are. We participate in the dialogue that they\u2019ve -- that they\u2019ve had up to this point leading up to the paper that they just released. And our experience has been that they\u2019ve been extremely inclusive with all partners seeking input. I\u2019d say, in terms of what it means for us, I mean, I don't think any of us exactly know and I think that will play itself out. What we do know is that we\u2019ve a network that works extraordinarily well, that provides great value for people that run transactions over it and a lot of what we do isn\u2019t easily duplicated. And its one thing to say that you're going to build something, its nothing to actually get it in the marketplace with the ability to put value added services around it. The people that participate in our network, the four parties get paid for it or they get benefits from it and they do it because they actually get those things out of it. So there are some very natural reasons why networks like ours and our competitors are attractive in the marketplace out there whether you\u2019re an issuer or whether you\u2019re an acceptor of the products. And as we\u2019ve talked about, what we spend our time, I mean, I don\u2019t want to underestimate the importance of running the network well, we spend a lot of time making sure that that\u2019s the case. We spend a lot of time on network security, but we spend even more time building value added products around it and the idea is that you run transaction over the Visa network and there is more value to you, because of either services we provide, whether its on a risk basis, whether its things that can help you grow your revenues and we\u2019re working on a series of things now that you will start to see in the marketplace. So again over a period of time, if people have a choice where to run their transaction over it, we\u2019re not going to sit here and say well, we just have a really good network, so you should run it over ours which we want to give both merchants, issuers and consumers ultimately reasons to want to use our network as opposed to any other solution out there.", "End of Q&A", "Jack Carsky", "And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us today. If anyone has any follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thanks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s Fiscal First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet, and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. The replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you for joining us. I plan to walk you through 3 key areas during today's call. First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012.", "Following that, I'll walk through our progress of growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments and innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams.", "Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectations during the first quarter, an encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011.", "Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment. ", "We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year, with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe.", "Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say, the dust is still settling.", "Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan, and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook. ", "Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens.", "As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation, and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook, we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders.", "We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan.", "Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. ", "Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States.  Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court's assistance, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues.  After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion.", "Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP. ", "Now let's turn to the business update.  During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology.", "Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter. ", "In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event.", "That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we have always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. While the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change. ", "The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact, driven by slower growth in PIN transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs. ", "A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for PIN transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards.", "While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment.", "To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies with issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we're poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter.", "At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships, and in fact have extended the majority of those major relationships to 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offer greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter.", "On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction's cost. As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month. ", "Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account, including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin. ", "As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels. ", "Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully.", "Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, affluent credit in the United States post a particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters.", "A key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of co-brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter, and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term.", "Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in 2 of the fastest-growing segments in the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefit programs. ", "For example, we extended our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C. Department of Employment Services recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards.", "In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid cards. ", "Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide.", "Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenues from International businesses by 2015.", "Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates. ", "In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.", "Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Rajhi Bank, covering around 50% of all payments volume in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product.", "We're also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with a footprint and technical expertise in emerging economies. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent. ", "An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through a mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally inter-operable electronic payment account. MTN group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTN MobileMoney customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda. ", "Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country.", "And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia Post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose, reloadable and travel products.", "We also want to mandate with ANZ, where a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up to 10 different currencies on a single card and lock in exchange rates, giving a cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with ANZ helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide.", "Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients.", "In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at a point-of-sale, with a card or phone or buying digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service in global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization.  And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012. ", "As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and Touch-to-buy functionalities, including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs.", "So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability, initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be expanding the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require buy-in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community. ", "To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners.", "At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers, who are showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters.", "We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced that hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS, and monetize global applications, can immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account holders. These can be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community.", "Immediately available services, include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. And we have plans to deploy additional offerings, including mobile check deposit, NFC payments, mobile offers and support for V.me.", "We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the globe, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.", "On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping, and our acquisition of CyberSource have placed them, favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled 1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago.", "We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, AutoTrader.com and ShutterPlay. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction.", "For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99Bill, one of that country's leading electronic-payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country.", "99Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager, and is using CyberSource services to complement their existing security systems to process cross border transactions safely as they expand business overseas.", "So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the future. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future. ", "Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States, and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total. ", "Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years.", "Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance, as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of deal activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter.", "Fourth, note that we are reporting the quarter using a 36% tax rate, above our full year guidance of 33%  to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin reporting at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2. ", "Finally, fifth, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction, driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore, had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation, but will have a full effect for the balance of the year.", "Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012.", "Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently-enacted bed [ph] rules.", "Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rates in both debit and credit. ", "More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%. Credit growth was 10%, while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin.", "Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, with the U.S. growing 11% and the rest of world 14%. ", "The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track.  In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15%, with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and rest of world to 17%.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule.", "For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%. ", "Now turning to the income statement.  Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive.", "The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line item.  Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions.", "On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth, which approximated 24% for the quarter.", "International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States.", "As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance, but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%. ", "Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp-up in investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. ", "Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. ", "Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from a lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results, retroactive to Q1. Thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range.", "As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion, resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million shares effective December 29.", "At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter.", "Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan.", "Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter.", "As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. global and global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary. ", "And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I had a question on the tax rate beyond the current year. Could we see that fall below your adjusted 33% to 34% range considering the changes that are coming? And secondly, marketing was dramatically below what I was thinking about for the quarter. So I was hoping to get your thoughts there regarding what opportunities did present themselves in the quarter and if your thought process changed for the year.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "For tax, it's a little early to make that call since we've got this year to play out. But we will, rest assured, we will address tax guidance for the coming year in the next couple of quarters, which is our practice. With regards to marketing, no change. Think of this as timing. Our guidance hasn't changed. We have the Summer Olympics coming up, and we are rephasing our marketing spend to coincide better with the Olympics and the promotions that come in advance. So you should expect to see some movement on the marketing line in fiscal quarters 2 and 3 commensurate with that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I mean volume trends looked like they've held up pretty well, especially into January. And now we have a guidance change especially on the -- on both the top line and on EPS. Do you think that the guidance is more -- or the change is more reflective of really more benign impacts of maybe the debit regulations as was included in your previous guidance? Or is it more macro-driven? And I guess just the follow-up question to that would be is there more room around the rebates? Maybe -- the 17% to 18% is just conservative on the rebates because maybe the debit environment or the Durbin environment effects were not as bad as expected?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So let me take that. This is more a reflection of how some of the risks that Joe and I called out on the last quarter's earnings call, how some of those risks are playing out. Recognizing that we have a one quarter lag on our service fees, that means we've already got a line of sight into 7 months of that revenue. Cross border volumes have held up very well. With regards to both the U.S. and the global economy, both have demonstrated sustained momentum. The exciting drama unfolding in Europe has yet to really play out on the volumes. And so the guidance adjustments are more a function of having a portion of our year with a clear line of sight. And some of the risks we were most concerned about we're getting well into the fiscal year, and they haven't materialized to the degree that -- we had to at least contemplate when we gave the initial guidance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Joe, thanks for the color on the issuer loss. Was this the ultimate result of a holistic view by the issuer that under no circumstances would they pursue a dual strategy? Or was this a case you wouldn't go as low as they wanted on price? And secondly, could you give us a sense of what portion of your exclusive PIN debit issuers still has to make a decision? What type of win rate have you assumed in your guidance?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well getting back to the particular issuer that we talked about, it was -- I think it's fair to say that it was just a decision about how they were going to comply with the law and knowing to a certain extent that accepting PIN numbers on signature cards as we've always done was an opportunity. I think it was just their way of rationalizing how they wanted to go forward. It weren't a price issue. And then what was the second part of the question? I'm sorry.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "How many still have to make a decision.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Yes, on removing Interlink, I think most of them have made their decision. There is no other major issuer that has Interlink on the back of the card that's contemplating taking it off. And we have had several wins on putting the Interlink mark on the back of non-Visa debit cards, and that will manifest itself certainly no later than April 1. But I can't really talk about it. We're in the final stages of several contracts, and they don't like us to disclose who they are.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Everything looks really clean here. I just wanted to ask on the client incentives. Byron, you said they were running below the 4-year targets. Should we expect it to spike again around the April 1 exclusivity day? Just trying to get some help with the quarterly spread. And just as a follow-up to that, Joe, you said that the dust hasn't settled. Is it fair to interpret that to mean, how should I say it, that you haven't started playing defense yet with your MPS or the V PIN strategy? Are the issuers, and the acquirers to open the both? Just wanted to get a little bit of color on that.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "The second part of the question first. And then Byron can answer the first part of the question. When I said the dust hasn't settled, I also suggested that I'm very happy with how we've implemented our strategies and I am very happy about that, and things appear to be playing out quite well in that regard. But how we get to the end of the year and we see exactly what the actual results are, there is some ambiguity, although changing our guidance and expressing a degree of confidence would suggest that we're pretty happy with where we are and what's going on.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Tien-Tsin, I would say that it's clearly weighted to the second half of the year after April 1. If you think in the context of -- a portion of these incentives are assigned to merchant routing, and they trigger when the routing is successfully sent Visa's way. That's going to weight a portion of the incentives that really hasn't -- that isn't as relevant in the first 2 quarters of the year relative to the second. And then the rate of deal activity, which has nothing to do with Durbin, but has to do with the ongoing course of our business, primarily credit, both in the United States and outside the United States, that level of deal activity was just less than we anticipated in the first quarter. And so that will just carry forward into quarters 2, 3 and 4. So we are -- we reaffirmed our guidance as 17% to 18%. We still feel good about that. No real call-outs, just timing.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So Joe, you mentioned that you've been happy with your strategy implementation. Byron, you mentioned that the Durbin incentives were lower than you had modeled. I guess if you had to summarize it at this vantage point, has Durbin turned out to be better, worse or the same than you had originally contemplated?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I think it's modestly better than what we had contemplated. I think that the implementation of our strategy has put us at the better part of that, which is what I've said about the regulation pretty consistently. So I don't -- I just -- I don't know how to put it in total perspective because as I said earlier, we got to see what happens. In some cases, there's been accelerated early adoption. And in some cases, there's been less early adoption. And I think it appears like it's going to even out, and it appears like things will occur in a manner that we've anticipated. When I say that, I'm not really factoring in the potential positive effect of some of the things that we've done to drive volume to us over time. And we will have to see how that works out with the -- through the acquirers and the merchant community.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess one question for Joe and then another for Byron. I guess Joe, what kind of impact do you expect in the model, with the change in pricing that's going to go on, on April 1? And I know it's going to be a change in pricing for all products. It's not just debit. I know it includes credit. I'm just curious on what kind of impact do you think it will have. And then Byron, when we look at the international revenues, they're now, for 2 quarters in a row, growing faster than the cross border volume growth. Is that just better pricing that we're getting? What is driving that phenomenon the past 2 quarters?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So let me answer the international one first. So we reported nominal growth at 12%, and there was a 19% increase in revenue. Whenever there is significant above-average currency volatility, then our revenue stream trends up. And then -- and so that's the primary delta that you are seeing. It doesn't have anything to do with our pricing. It's much more a function of currency volatility, and that has largely been courtesy of Europe and the unfolding drama around the euro. With regards to -- let me see if I understand the question. On balance in U.S. debit, when you combine the fixed acquiring network fee with the lower variable transaction fees associated with U.S. debit, this constitutes a net price reduction. And that has been completely folded into our guidance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So have your common switch plans and network participation fee plans met any meaningful obstacles? And could you provide more specifics on how the common switch and network participation fee will be implemented presumably in coming months here?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I think that what we've done, we've announced 2 quarters ago, and we've consistently talked about, I think any time you change the paradigm that there's probably some consternation somewhere along the way. But in general, we've met with -- it's been pretty benign, and we've met with favorable receptivity. I would say out of our largest merchants, there are a significant number of them that have signed contracts with us that anticipate the fixed fee. And they're fine with it. I mean I suppose that doesn't mean that they won't complain about it later, but that's kind of the history of our business. As it relates to that, we're putting -- officially we'll put out the specifications for that in about the -- in the next week. As it relates to activate -- fully activating the PIN capability on the Visa debit card, that would begin on April 1. And all of those things are going along as we anticipated, as we had planned. We're very happy with the way that it turned out. And as you might expect, I mean there's been a lot of water that's gone under the bridge. They're both complicated paradigms. As Byron says, we feel that we're in a much better position in the long run with a modest fixed fee and a lower variable fee. We believe that, that suits merchants in a much more compatible way than in the past because they can take advantage of economies of scale. It is not price increases. As we speak today, as it relates to the PIN capability on the signature cards, that seems to be the way things are moving. It's a capability that we have, and we're very comfortable with that as well.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Joe, could you highlight some of the innovation you have planned on the credit side? You indicated that a credit volume growth was twice what debit was in the U.S. in December and much of the growth came from the affluent. So how do you see the competitive battle shaping up in U.S. credit versus MasterCard particularly on the affluent side?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well when I look back over the last 2 or 3 years, I mean I'm very comfortable with how we fared and what we've done. Based on the number of things that I talked about in my remarks, I'm very bullish on where we're going to wind up in 2012 as a result of some new transactions that are on the cusp of occurring. That doesn't mean that I don't consider MasterCard to be a formidable competitor because they are. It doesn't mean that every time we get involved in a transaction, that we'll win and they'll lose. But I'd have to say as it regards to credit, we're in a pretty good position. Remember, we've talked the last 2 quarters about the United-Continental merger and our win in that regard. I think as I mentioned in my remarks, we have the best array of co-branded partners, period. And that is what's driving a lot of the growth. So we feel like we're in a very good position. We don't feel that, that's a position through which we can rest on our laurels. We do believe that V.me and the wallet and the single click is going to make a difference in the credit card world, as well as the debit card world. So I think we're trying to move forward in a very measured way and we're pretty excited about our prospects. And the same goes for our international business.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My question actually kind of follows on to that, to the last one in. In terms of the trends that you see within debit and credit, is it -- are you able to tell if this growth in credit is -- whether it be affluent or a broader growth in credit usage or if there's actually consumers making a conscious choice to pick up a credit card versus a debit card? Just as you think about those different trends, are you seeing anything that is fundamentally where consumers are choosing a credit card over a debit card or if it's just that a selection that issuers are pushing more credit cards versus debit?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well remember the credit card volume has been growing quite robustly for several quarters now. And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell, looking at the volumes exactly, what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably -- I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. Obviously issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other. But I think it's pretty clear that you're going to see strong credit card growth at least from Visa in the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Byron, this is directly for you. I guess just in terms of the numbers, and I apologize if I missed any of this. But the 9% processed transaction gross versus the 13% data processing revenue growth, obviously, the effects of Durbin and some of the impacts there on debit are a big part of the decline of processed. But the spread relative to the revenue growth was actually much better than expected. So just some color in terms of why that spread went  the way that it did and for how long would this actually continue to persist before you see that in your portfolio anniversary?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So the debit processing fees grew at 8%, but we reported at the gross level data processing fee growth of 13%. Of that delta, I would say 60% of it is due to the addition of CyberSource and PlaySpan transactions into the data processing line. And the other 40% is due to value-added services that show up in the other fee category of data processing. And so those are -- that explains 100% of the premium that we are earning above the growth -- underlying growth in data processing transactions. And I would expect that, that premium -- certainly, the CyberSource and PlaySpan piece will continue. We'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year as we see much more impact from, or potential impact from implementation of the Federals.", "Operator", "The last question does come from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I'd like to follow up on some of your comments about Fundamo and your investments in MobileMoney. Does what you're doing there influence your relationship with Western Union in any way? And can you update us on whether you expect to be able to deal with some of the AML issues that arise in mobile money transfer? And just more broadly, can you comment on where you see the cost of electronic-money transfers going especially in comparison to that 500 to 600 basis points of revenues per dollar volume that Western Union has traditionally generated.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I don't think that there's an absolute connection between Fundamo and Western Union and the Western Union-type of business. Remember, I think Fundamo is an incredible part of our future. I think that using mobile technology as an access point to Visa prepaid cards in emerging economies, where there's a lot of under, under-banked people is just one of the most incredible things that I've seen coming along in quite some time. As it relates to money transfer and Western Union, we are much more heavily involved with Western Union today, and will be in 2012 than we really ever have been before. And we are doing a number of things with them and some of the -- as it relates to money transfer in some of the emerging economies. And I'm going to kind of leave it -- leave Western Union at that. But we also, as you know, do business with MoneyGram. And I mean we're pretty invested in money transfer business for the unbanked. We are aware of the issues that surround the transfer of money and the protections that it requires and so forth and so on. And we're doing things through people that have those infrastructures. And we're happy where we are right now. Let me say we're happy to be doing what we're doing, and we will continue to endeavor to.", "Jack Carsky", "Well thank you all for joining us today.

Sir, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "", "Thank you, Jose. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings conference call.", "Speaking today are Joe Saunders, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.", "Joe Saunders", "Thank you, Jack, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Before I discuss earnings, let me speak to the Discover litigation which as you know, we settled just two days ago. We are obviously very pleased that we were able to put this behind us in a manner quite consistent with our retrospective responsibility plan. An additional component of the Discover settlement is settlement of unasserted claims by MasterCard. And with this settlement, I am delighted to tell you that in all disputes, no direct cost to our public Class A shareholders and there is no dilution to their holdings.", "With respect to the MasterCard release as previously reported, Visa Inc. had taken a $30 million after-tax reserve in the third quarter since this claim is not covered by the retrospect of responsibility plan. As the obligation was connected to the ultimate settlement amount, we recognized an additional $80 million after-tax reserve this quarter.", "As a result of the Discover settlement, we will be taking steps this fiscal first quarter to fund our escrow account with an additional $1.1 billion. As per our retrospective responsibility plan, when we fund the escrow, our Class B shareholders will bear this cost via a reduction in their as converted share count.", "It is our intention to seek an amendment to our charger to permit us to deposit our own funds into the escrow account and buy down Class B ownership directly. This approach reduces the total number of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes, effectively operating as a share repurchase program in the amount of $1.1 billion.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to earnings. In the face of a tough US economic environment and increasingly difficult international economic situation as well, the relative resiliency of Visa\u2019s business model is once again reflected in our earnings results. Our adjusted fourth quarter net income was $448 million. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.58. For all of 2008 adjusted net income was $1.7 billion, while adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.25.", "Net operating revenues in the fourth quarter were strong at $1.7 billion, an increase of 17% over the fourth quarter of 2007 on a pro forma basis, as we again saw solid growth across all three categories. For the full year 2008, net operating revenues were $6.3 billion, an increase of 21% over 2007 on a pro forma basis.", "As we have signaled in the past earnings calls, we are now seeing operating revenues running more in line with our long term guidance as the positive effects of earlier pricing adjustments had generally been reflected on a year-over-year comparative basis. We also continued to realize the positive impact of our operating scale on our efforts in reorganizing Visa as a publicly traded company. We maintain good expense control on our fourth fiscal quarter and for all of 2008, and we remain committed to managing our expenses prudently without compromising investments in products and technology necessary to fuel future growth.", "As a result, we delivered strong operating margins this quarter, in line with our recently increased external guidance of mid to high 40% range and we expect to continue that to be the case in fiscal 2009 and 2010. Though the recent past has been relatively positive, what are we seeing for the future?", "From a broad prospective, we are seeing a further slowdown in consumer spending activity in the US as well as in cross-border buyers. Here in the US for the calendar quarter ending September 2008, on which our 2009 first fiscal quarter's US service fee revenue will be based, aggregate payment volume growth in US has continued to trend at the 10% level seen in the June quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume growth average in the low single digits in the quarter trending lower through September.", "In sharp contrast to credit, debit volume growth was running at low to mid double digits throughout the quarter, pointing out not only the resiliency of this product but the fact that the secularship to plastic continues. Since the beginning of October, we have experienced additional moderation in volume growth in the US credit payment volume which was in the 1% to 2% range for most of the quarter has turned negative through the first three weeks of October.", "In contrast, debit payment volume has continued to grow at low double digits. While international payment volume growth rates remained stable through September, cross-border volumes are off the high-teen level seen in the June quarter and were running in the high single digits at the end of September. And it is important to remember that, despite the current economic turbulence, international growth both in credit and debit continues to offer us very attractive longer term opportunities as economies mature and payment systems evolve around the globe. Visa is in a superior position to benefit from this trend over the long term.", "So working in our favor is our industry leading debit presence here in the US and still positive growth rates in credit and cross-border volumes around the globe through September. This should allow us to meet the high end of our 11% to 15% revenue guidance for our fiscal first quarter of 2009, and based on initial observations in October, the middle of the range for our second fiscal quarter.", "Given the uncertainty over the longer term direction of the economy however, in the US and around the globe for the full year of 2009 and 2010, we are targeting the lower end of that 11% to 15% revenue range including the possibility of single digit growth in our fiscal third and fourth quarters with low to flat cross-border volume growth.", "But importantly, we remain committed to meeting our guidance of adjusted operating revenue margin in the mid to high 40% range and the 20%\u00a0plus adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for 2009 and 2010. Even in a downside scenario that saw only mid to high singe digit revenue growth in 2010, we could sustain these targets. Byron will cover additional guidance metrics and other underlying dynamics momentarily.", "Finally, let me touch on the current wave of bank consolidation and how I see it affecting Visa over the near and longer return. Well, bank consolidation has accelerated recently. It has been a constant factor in the financial industry for decades. The Visa organization and our strength in both credit and debit has proven to be highly adaptable to the changing marketplace conditions. Past mergers in the industry have not had a negative affect on us. To the contrary, our technology scale and product suites make us an attractive partner to our very largest clients as well as the smaller community banks risk and credit units.", "So in the current wave of consolidation, we believe that we are in good shape but that does not mean that we are resting on the positive history of these relationships or that we take them for granted. We will remain focused on serving our clients and adding value to those relationships wherever we can.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and I will be back to provide updates around some of our newer business initiatives.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. Let me begin by highlighting some of the business and revenue drivers from the quarter that are representative of the strength of our business.", "Payment volume through the end of June, which drives our fourth quarter service fees, grew 15% to $699 billion over the same quarter of 2007 on a pro forma basis with the US growing at 10% and the rest of the world growing at 25%. In the September ending quarter, US payments volume continued in the 10% range. Through the first three weeks of October, US payments volume growth has moved to mid-single digits with credit turning negative and debit in the low double digits.", "Cross-border volume growth in the June-ending quarter was in the high teens moderating to the mid teens in the September quarter though trending lower through the period to end the month of September in the high single digits. In October, cross-border volume growth continued to trend down in all regions except CEMEA.", "To put cross-border payment volume in historical context, in the recessionary period of late 2001 and early 2002, monthly payment volume growth fell to low single digits and there were several months that were slightly negative, but the severity differed around the globe and on an annual basis. It remained positive for each of those years and importantly upon an economic recovery, the rebound was swift and meaningful across all regions.", "Moving on to transaction growth, payment and cash transactions were up 14% to $14.1 billion in the quarter ending June 2008 versus the prior year. While the US grew approximately 10% during the period, the rest of the world grew at 20% led by our CEMEA region at 27% and Asia Pacific and Latin America at 19% and 23% respectively.", "Process transactions or those that we define as being processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $9.6 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 11% over the similar period a year ago. Globally, which excludes Europe, card growth for the period ending June was up 12% with over 1.6 billion cards carrying the Visa brand. Credit grew 8% to 798 million cards while debit rose 17% to 847 million cards.", "Internationally, credit and debit card growth was very strong, each growing 18% year-over-year. While credit in general is a more mature market domestically, you can see that internationally we continue to have a lot of runway. On the debit side, as we have often stated, one of our near-term goals is moving these debit cards from cash at ATMs to the point of sale.", "Moving on to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2 billion were up 20% from the pro forma prior year. Volume and support incentives increased by $83 million to $299 million representing 15% of gross revenue. For the full year, gross revenues of $7.4 billion were up 26% from the 2007 pro forma period.", "Volume and support incentives increased by $447 million to $1.2 billion representing 16% of gross revenue. For 2009, we are expecting volume and support incentives will run in the 16% to 17% range. If we continue to see lower levels of payment volume growth, we would expect to see some offsetting benefit in this line item.", "Total net operating revenues were just over $1.7 billion, a 17% increase over the pro forma operating revenues reported for the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, total net operating revenues were $6.3 billion, a 21% increase over the pro forma operating revenues of $5.2 billion reported for 2007.", "Moving on to the individual revenue line items, service fee revenue was $788 million, up 8% over the pro forma results of the prior year period, reflective of higher year-over-year payment volumes in all regions. For all of 2008, service fees were $3.1 billion up 19% over 2007 on a pro forma basis. Data processing fee revenue was $548 million, up 18% over the prior year period's pro forma $463 million. For the full year, data processing fees were $2.1 billion, up 25% over 2007.", "International transaction fees were up 45% to $512 million. While for the full year 2008, they were up 44% to $1.7 billion. Both time periods continued to benefit from strong, multicurrency payment volume across all regions as well as from pricing adjustments we made in April of this year to cross-border transactions involving US issued cards.", "As mentioned earlier, cross-border transactions are currently moderating across the globe though we remain cautiously optimistic that they will continue to post growth and rebound with the economy.", "Our adjusted operating margin was approximately 45% this quarter and 46% for the full year consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the fourth quarter declined $229 million or 20% year-over-year to $943 million, driven primarily by lower cost for marketing and personnel.", "For all of 2008, on an adjusted basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, a decline of 4% compared to the 2007 pro forma period, again driven by lower cost for advertising and personnel. We expect that advertising and marketing expense in 2009 to be relatively flat to 2008 and we are continuing our focus on driving operating efficiencies across the enterprise.", "Capital expenditures were $93 million in the quarter, over half of which were dedicated to the build out of our new data center. Fiscal 2008 capital expending was approximately $415 million. For fiscal 2009, we expect CapEx to be between $300 million and $350 million lower than the 2008 figure, but still elevated as we complete our new data processing center. Post 2009, we expect CapEx to run at around 3% to 4% of gross revenue on annualized basis.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investment and restricted cash of $7.5 billion, a decline of approximately $900 million over the prior quarter. This variance was the result of our annual $200 million payment for the retailer\u2019s litigation settlement which runs through 2012, as well as a reclassification of approximately $953 million from the cash line to the other current assets line on our balance sheet.", "This reclassification was the result of our investment in the reserve primary fund, a previously highly rated money market fund becoming illiquid. This resulted in an impairment charge of $29 million in the fourth quarter. We believe we will receive our net investment of $953 million over the coming months as the fund is liquidated. This charge is reflected in the investment income line on our P&L and it\u2019s the primary reason we saw a decline in that line this quarter.", "Of the current $7.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investments, and restricted cash, restricted cash of approximately $1.9 billion represents the balance of the $3 billion litigation escrow established at the IPO less the initial payments to American Express of $1.1 billion. Please also note that of the $7.5 billion in year-end cash, that on October 10, we deployed $2.6 billion to redeem all of the Series II and a portion of the Series III class C shares that were held by this year. Thus, on a pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents should be reduced by this amount for the current fiscal quarter.", "Let me remind you that the balance of this C class common stockholders holding continue to be locked up until March 2011, while the class B shares are locked up until the later of March 2011 or upon resolution of all of the covered litigations. Our pro forma share count post this redemption stands at 776 million shares. As we have stated since our IPO road show, given our sizeable free cash flow, we have always anticipated implementing a share repurchase program in keeping with our strong belief in returning excess cash to stockholders.", "In this context, the action Joe discussed earlier to fund the escrow this quarter directly from our cash balances has the same effect of a stock repurchase since Visa will be buying down Class C shareholdings and reducing the amount of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes. The size of the repurchase is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion.", "Before I get into our views on 2009 and 2010, let me bring you up-to-date on how we are viewing our evolving capital structure strategy. Simply stated, the key objectives are to reduce our cost of capital over time, ensure adequate liquidity to cover transaction settlement risk and provide sufficient financing capacity to fund future contractual or other obligations such as a Visa Europe and attractive acquisitions.", "As part of this strategy, management also intends to identify excess cash on the balance sheet and then further enhance total shareholder return by returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases.", "Under our preferred approach, the reduction in shares associated with the replenishment of the escrow account will be funded from excess cash. Although we have significant debt capacity today, we have no compelling use of proceeds and therefore plan to wait and add that at an appropriate time.", "As we enter fiscal year 2009, the company believes that the combination of its cash reserves, bank collateral, credit revolver, and debt capacity is more than sufficient to cover Visa\u2019s liquidity needs from any individual bank disruption or foreseeable financial events. As our capital strategy evolves, we will keep you updated.", "Now, let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned. As Joe already mentioned, payment volume growth is moderating. As a result, on a full year basis, we are projecting revenues to come in at the lower end of our 11% to 15% guidance range. While we expect to achieve the high end of the range in our first fiscal quarter and the middle of the range in the second fiscal quarter, the third and fourth quarters could be more challenging with the possibility of single-digit growth.", "We are maintaining our mid to high 40% range for adjusted operating margins in both 2009 and 2010 as we should continue to realize incremental savings from our merger and cost initiatives. We remain on tract to deliver annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%, again for both 2009 and 2010 while annual free cash flow should exceed 2008\u2019s figure of $1.7 billion. Our normalized tax rate for fiscal 2009 is projected to be 40% and we continue to take actions that are geared towards driving the rate down into a 35% to 36% range over the next four years.", "That concludes my comments, so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Joe.", "", "Joe Saunders", "Thanks, Byron. Before we begin Q&A, let me give you a quick update on some of our longer term initiatives and their progress. Since our IPO road show, we have repeatedly talked about a series of longer term strategic priorities that we would be investing in to support our growth. Longer term opportunities we\u2019ve identified include money transfer, prepaid, mobile payments, and ecommerce. Many of these innovations already are operational in Visa regions worldwide. A number of Visa\u2019s new structure can be scaled more easily on a global basis.", "In late September, we hosted a technology and innovation day in New York for members of the media, trade organizations, and analysts. In conjunction with that event, we announced several new innovative advances in electronic payments and services. First, we announced that we are developing the suite of mobile applications for the Google Android platform, which will be available for download on Android-powered handsets and initially available to select Visa cardholders.", "The services will allow Visa cardholders to receive notifications to their mobile devices about transaction activity on their accounts, obtain offers from a wide array of merchants, and use the built-in location-based technology developed by Google to quickly map nearby merchants where they can redeem Visa offers and locate ATMs that accept Visa.", "We also announced in September that we are working with Nokia, the world\u2019s largest mobile handset manufacturer, to deliver Visa payments and related services for Nokia\u2019s next generation Near-Field Communications handsets. The Visa applications will first be made available for trial use by interested financial institutions. In conjunction with US Bancorp, we have launched the Mobile Money Transfer Pilot Program to allow participating Visa cardholders to use their mobile phones and PDAs to securely send funds directly to another Visa cardholder. The first phase in the program which is expected to launch in early 2009 will enable domestic money transfers within the U.S. or involve key Visa issuers led by US bank in as many as 6,000 Visa accounts.", "Lastly, we announced the expansion of Visa ReadyLink, a prepaid reload service to enable the reload of eligible Visa prepaid products, products of ATM across the US. Visa ReadyLink gives consumers a secure and convenient way to purchase and add funds to Visa Reloadable Prepaid Cards, a significant advantage to financially underserved consumers and those without a traditional banking relationship or access to a payment card. Visa estimates that there are more than 80 million financially underserved consumers in United States.", "In addition to the above initiative updates, we have landed a number of new pieces of business recently and although they may not be adding meaningfully to revenue in the near term, they speak volumes to our position in the debit markets around the world.", "First, last quarter, we singed a multiyear agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group under which the bank will begin issuing Visa-branded debit cards to all its customers. RBS includes Citizens Financial Group here in the United States. The migration to the Visa brand is expected to take place in the second half of 2009. This is obviously a big win for Visa in a highly competitive marketplace. We appreciate the trust and confidence RBS has placed in Visa and our debit offerings.", "Second, we are announcing today that Visa and HSBC are expanding our global relationship to include new debit card programs in a dozen countries and territories throughout Asia Pacific and the first debit Visa payWave-enabled contact-less payment programs in the Middle East. Under the terms of the five-year agreement for Asia Pacific, Visa will become an HSBC partner for consumer debit products with HSBC issuing more than 10 million Visa debit cards in countries including Australia, India, Indonesia and Taiwan.", "In addition, HSBC Middle East Limited will begin issuing Visa-branded debit cards in the regions in early 2009. Some of these new cards will be Visa payWave-enabled, allowing consumers to make contact-less payment transactions quickly and securely at the point of sale. The HSBC Visa debit card will be available to all HSBC customers in eight countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.", "We are obviously delighted with our new arrangements with RBS Citizens and HSBC and look forward to working with both partners to help build their respective businesses. Importantly, these agreements deliver on our strategy to expand Visa\u2019s global debit leadership as we seek to further the migration from cash and check to Visa payments.", "With that, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Yes, thank you. (Operator instructions) First question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JP Morgan. You may ask your question.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks, I appreciate all the disclosure. It\u2019s really helpful. Let me ask a question about pricing. Has your thinking on pricing and the ability to push through price increase has changed at all since last quarter, given your commentary on the macro?", "Joe Saunders", "", "I think that our position on pricing remains consistent with where we\u2019ve been up to now, and I think that we\u2019ve indicated that what we do from a pricing standpoint will be consistent with good business practices and our partnerships around the world.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, very good. May I just make a quick follow-up and just on bank consolidation. Joe, I know you gave some comments there but can you just give some additional insight on how and maybe when network brand decisions are made as a result to consolidation and obviously, how Visa\u2019s decision given some of the known consolidation that\u2019s out there?", "Joe Saunders", "Well, to say the least, we\u2019re in an extraordinary environment and some of these transfers take on \u2013 they\u2019re different and they will happen at different times. We obviously, as I said, are in constant contact with our partners and will continue to be so, but I think it\u2019s inappropriate to talk about contractual relationships.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Adam Frisch, UBS. You may ask your question.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. Good afternoon and great job on the color as well, for what you\u2019re seeing there. I have two questions on credit. First, can you speak to the quality of the 47% of your transactions in the U.S. that are credit? Any metric or set of data point that enables us to more appropriately assess the composition of your credit card holders?", "Joe Saunders", "I\u2019m not sure that credit card \u2013 well, credit cards are not 47% of our \u2013", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "I\u2019m just talking about the transaction or the GDV rather. 47% of your GDV, but anything that speaks to the composition of your cardholders whether it be FICO scores [ph] or how many \u2013 what percent of them are revolvers or what percent of them are maxed out on credit lines, or anything that gives us some \u2013?", "Joe Saunders", "We\u2019re seeing a shift, a continued shift in both the debit and the credit to non-discretionary purchases. And indeed, when we\u2019ve gone back and looked at it, it is the more credit-worthy credit cardholders that seem to be driving most of the purchases in the environment today. There\u2019s a very low percentage of those transactions that are being driven by people that are credit-impaired or is in the low end of the cycle bends.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "And what percentage of your cardholders would be in that minority that are not generating a lot of this bend.", "Joe Saunders", "About 5%.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "Okay, so that\u2019s great. And then just one other follow-up on the New York Times article today, talking basically about their suggestion of the systemic shrinking of the consumer credit card industry; obviously, more movement than normal than we\u2019re seeing with different issuers, but do you see the entire supply side getting materially smaller? Or is it just some shifts going on between issuers in specific geographies?", "Joe Saunders", "That\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m in a position to amplify on that right now. Hold the thought for a quarter and let me observe what\u2019s happened from all this movement in the last several weeks.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Charlie Murphy, Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Charlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. I was wondering if you could discuss the growth in service fees at 8% this quarter versus the 15% payment volume. Is that an indication of pricing pressure and how you expect that dynamic to play out over the next few quarters?", "Byron Pollitt", "This is Byron. Thank you for asking, Charlie. As I think many of you can appreciate in October at this time last year, we merged together five distinct autonomous regions, and no sooner did we merge them and complete or IPO then we began to standardize all the regions on a common chart of account; and what we realized, Charlie, when as we began this exercise was that not all of our regions classify the revenue components in quite the same way, in terms of key categories as we report externally.", "So as a result, in recent months, we have begun taking steps to standardize our revenue classifications globally and therefore, you\u2019re beginning to see some of the effects of this common reporting format being applied; and therefore, you are all just going to bear with us on that because our 2008 growth rates by-fee category are just not going to normalize until some time next year.", "In this particular case, some of the early adjustments we are making are shifting some of what had been classified as service fees to data processing fees; and hence, the difference in the growth rates. I just want to emphasize two things. This has nothing to do with our ability to price or generate strong growth in any of these categories; and secondly, none of these changes impact our recorded total revenue. It\u2019s getting all our regions aligned to report their key categories in a common standardized global format.", "Charlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Craig Maurer with Calyon. You may ask your question.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon", "Good afternoon. I wanted to ask if the global slowdown was affecting the level of banks in emerging markets that are looking to add your products or if it\u2019s having any effect on the secular growth in terms of bringing on new economies? Thanks.", "Joe Saunders", "No. No, it isn\u2019t. It certainly isn\u2019t noticeable to us. We continue to make progress in emerging countries. Some of our biggest successes recently have been and continued to be in that category.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great. Real quickly, Byron. Can you just go back to the two largest components of your expense, of your operating expenses, looking at personnel, advertising, marketing and promotion, and just walk us through how much further or what levels do you think you can drive those two as you think about the offsets to a slightly lower revenue trajectory over the next two years?", "Byron Pollitt", "So let me respond in this way. As you may all recall from the road show, management had identified approximately $300 million of expense opportunity across the enterprise that we were committed to achieving as a part of the combination or merger of the five regions. We believe that of that original commitment, we\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through. However, we are also confident that there are additional opportunities beyond the $300 million originally committed, and that conviction is reflected in our guidance for 2009 and 2010, as it relates to our margins.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. And then just, can you just rehash the buyback commentary that you made with regards to the Class B shares please?", "Byron Pollitt", "So in the preferred approach that Joe described, what we were \u2013", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I just meant the timing of it, that\u2019s all I really need to hear.", "Byron Pollitt", "I\u2019m sorry. Later session half of the current quarter.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. You may ask your question.", "Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust", "Hi. Thanks. Could you, Byron, address a little bit the priorities for ad spend and whether you view that as a particular lever, especially given the slowdown in the U.S. I imagine there\u2019s probably a reallocation of advertising and marketing spending priorities here.", "Byron Pollitt", "Let\u2019s refresh the guidance, the guidance was marketing spending about flat 2009 versus 2008. In previous commentary, we have indicated that we are reallocating against an increasingly rigorous return on investment model that we are deploying in marketing. And so, using that model that is guiding what we have budgeted for 2009, but we will of course pace our expenditures with regards to the economic environment we find ourselves in and the rate of growth we are generating in revenue.", "Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay.", "Joe Saunders", "I\u2019d like to add one thing to that. The vast majority of our advertising in 2009 will be targeted at getting people to use plastic when they do whatever they do more frequently than they do today. So in other words, whether the category grows in absolute terms or not, we are dedicated to providing impetus to get people to use the card more. So I want \u2013 when you go to Starbucks, when you go to movie theater, when you go to a \u2013 when you park your car, when you go to the Laundromat, when you take a taxi in New York, when you pay your utility bills or any one of the number of other bills, I want you to use a Visa debit card, and we will have advertising that is directed at doing that. That\u2019s not just similar to what we did a year ago when we had people running around in a circle and somebody throwed [ph] food in the air when an individual took out cash. That was focused on telling people, it\u2019s okay to use a debit card for a small or medium-sized transaction. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s the thing to do. It isn\u2019t something that\u2019s odd.", "Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay.", "Joe Saunders", "So that's how we are going to direct our advertising.", "Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you. And just to clarify on the comments you made on the contra revenue. Does your second half \u201909 net revenue guidance contemplate a deceleration or decline in contra revenue in addition to lower volume, or is that something that could be an increment to the net revenue guidance?", "Joe Saunders", "It\u2019s inclusive. So when we guided to the revenue levels in the second half, they were net revenue levels reflective of our associated projections of incentives.", "Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) The next question comes from Pat Burton, Citi. You may ask your question.", "Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi. Thank you. First, a clarification, Joe, did you say the U.S. payment for credit card was negative in October? It just had turned negative?", "Joe Saunders", "Yes, I did.", "Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. That was a clarification. The second \u2013 the question actually is on the international transaction fee, the discussion there, I assume you\u2019re just seeing a lot of fall off in airline travel. Would that be a good leading indicator to look at in terms of just number of physical bodies that are traveling internationally, or is there something else driving that number?", "Joe Saunders", "I mean, that certainly is a significant component but traditionally there\u2019s always been a lot of cross-border volume between Canada and the United States and that\u2019s people in cars going back and forth, not necessarily in airplanes. There\u2019s always been a lot of cross-border volume between Mexico and the United States, and that maybe coming from Tijuana into San Diego. It isn't all\u2013 it isn't by any straight [ph] imagination all airplane travel, I mean, cross-border activity in Asia is also \u2013 given where the countries are, it\u2019s not necessary airplane travel. But it is a big component and it's an indicator.", "Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "And is it falling globally, or is it just falling as it relates to people traveling to the United States?", "Joe Saunders", "I think it\u2019s following globally. All of our guidance contemplates it. Right now, it\u2019s a troubled global economy and people are not traveling as much. People are not coming to the United States as much as they did with the dollar strengthening. There\u2019s a number of things going on. I think it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to get it sorted out. And we\u2019re just putting out guidance that embraces an economy that\u2019s pretty indefinable at this particular point in time. We don\u2019t want to overshoot anything, so we\u2019re trying to be cautious and conservative in what we suggest.", "Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you and nice job on the cost side guys.", "Joe Saunders", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Mammone, Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Chris Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks. I guess \u2013 first is a couple of housekeeping questions on cross-border. One, what was the growth in cross-border last year? And then two, what is the breakdown in your cross-border base between debit and credit?", "Joe Saunders", "I'll tell you what, on the growth curve last year \u2013 let me put it in this context, cross-border volume growth at the beginning of the fiscal year was running in the high 20s globally. As we moved to the third quarter call, we indicated that it had moved down into the high-teens, and now you have cross-border volume, our most recent snapshot, now moderating into the high single-digits. That gives you a one year continuum. And then, cross-border for us is primarily credit and roughly three quarters credit, 25% debit.", "Chris Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess Joe, could you just update us with your thoughts on the possibility for interchange regulation in the U.S. next year, I guess particularly given the likelihood that we\u2019ll have sweeping legislation from Congress probably early \u201909.", "Joe Saunders", "We continue to remain optimistic that things are going well in that regard. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some noise about it next year. I can\u2019t speak for Congress and so I can\u2019t tell you when it\u2019s going to come up again, but I would think that it would be relatively benign until about the middle of next year. Now, we have a very unique environment that we\u2019re operating in and I\u2019m not sure when this will come up. I continue to believe that it is solvable within the framework of the litigation, and that there\u2019s no need for legislation. And I think that we\u2019re going to work in that direction.", "Byron Pollitt", "Chris, let me refine the answer. Now that we have the chance to tabulate it, on cross-border, roughly a little over 60% credit, 25% debit, a little over 10% ATM cash.", "Chris Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Perlin [ph] of Wachovia. You may ask your question.", "Dan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia", "Thanks. Just two parts. One is with credits turning down in U.S. and debit volumes still sounding like they\u2019re running in the mid-teens range, I mean, it sounds like it is falling exactly as it did during the last recession. And I\u2019m wondering if you can highlight a few attributes for your business today that are different from that last recession that gives your conviction to be able to maintain even the double-digit overall growth rate.", "Joe Saunders", "I think it\u2019s pretty clear. I mean, the debit card was in the different part of its evolution in the last recession that we didn\u2019t have anywhere the debit coverage and we continue to extend the merchant categories in which debit cards can be used. And we continue to make information as it relates to that available to consumers and they seem to embrace it. And look, within all of these guidance that we are giving you, we are talking about things that are predicated on what we see out there in the economy, but you can rest assured that in addition to that, we are very, very focused on penetrating cash and checks to a greater degree than we have in the past and we will continue to do that. I think that that will be a little bit or somewhat of accounted balance to what is going in the economy and we are optimistic that that trend is likely to increase rather than decrease.", "Byron Pollitt", "I would just elaborate by saying that because of the debit phenomena that Joe described, if you go back to the last recession period, the nondiscretionary component of U.S. consumer spend on our Visa cards would have been about 30%. And today, because of the debit penetration, it is over 40%. With debit cards themselves generating about 53% nondiscretionary mix of the total spend.", "Dan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia", "Okay. And then the second part of the question is in the last couple of \u2013 I want go back and look at aggregate data in the last several recessions, one of the things that acted as a secular shift was just net new card issuance and I understand the debit shift. I\u2019m wondering what is going to be, with net new card issuance certainly, if 50% of your business not going up next year in the U.S., what is ultimately going to be that secular shift that supports again that double-digit growth?", "Byron Pollitt", "First of all, we are taking about the double-digit growth primarily coming from the debit product in this environment and I don\u2019t expect that to change in 2009. But we have also talked about a lot about our international volume and we talked about the fact that is continuing to grow at robust rates and frankly, most of that is credit card business. It is not that we do not have the debit penetration outside the United States that we do inside the United States, that is rather an opportunity that we talk about quite frequently on the IPO road trips, so we try to filling out the tube if you will, taking technology that work for us and business practices that have worked for us in the United States and moving them into other parts of the world.", "I think that what I just talked about in our relationship with HSBC is an example of moving debit cards into other regions. But, the answer is we are growing outside the United States, particularly in credit volume. We have an opportunity to grow debit volume outside of the United States and we have an opportunity to grow debit volume within the Untied States and I would assume that at some point in time, the credit volume is going to stabilize.", "Dan Perlin \u2013 Wachovia", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Greg Smith, Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yes, hi guys. What foreign currency impacts are you expecting on revenues in '09?", "Byron Pollitt", "This is Byron. Let me give you a preset. If we look back on the year just completed, 2008, we project that about two percentage points of our revenue growth came from FX movements, a tailwind so to speak. As we look to 2009, recognizing that there has been some significant volatility, and we are not in a position to fully predict how it will play out. But on the revenue growth side, that tailwind will turn into a headwind and we are looking at low single-digit revenue growth impacts in the coming year, 2009, and even smaller impact but still negative on the earnings growth impact since you net the two to get to your ultimate impact on the P&L.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then this buyback that you would like to do, the 1.1 billion, how will that be priced? Is it just going to literally be based off the current stock price at some point in time or is there some liquidity discount that might benefit you?", "Byron Pollitt", "I would say stay tuned for that, but it is a market-based price and then we will evaluate at that time whether and what level of discount would be appropriate.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay, hopefully a big one [ph]. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. You may ask your question.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Thank you. I appreciate all the color on the updated targets but I want to make sure I've got it all. Byron, could you just rehash the stress case on payment volume and cross-border volume derived at the low end of that 11% to 15%? And then maybe you could also stress the top line to get to that 20% EPS growth.", "Byron Pollitt", "With regards to the guidance that we gave, what we said was that we felt very confident delivering our margins and our earnings growth if the cross-border volumes went as low as flat. So to the extent that that constitutes a stress case, that is what we mean by that. Could you repeat the second part of your question?", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "I just want to make sure I understood the lowest payment volume could go and cross-border could go, and then subsequently how low could the top line go to get to the 20%?", "Byron Pollitt", "That we did not specifically comment on. We have clearly assessed the environment to the best we can ahead and we are very focused. The environment has a lot to do with revenue. We are very focused with regards to delivering our margins and delivering the net income growth and EPS growth that we have committed, and so management stands ready to take a variety of steps in order to protect their commitment of earnings and EPS growth.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Okay. Because I thought you mentioned like the payment volume in the fiscal second quarter should come in at the midpoint of the range and the second two quarters?", "Byron Pollitt", "I think your confusing something. What we are referring to was net revenue growth. And what we said in the first fiscal quarter is that we expect net revenue growth to come in at the upper end of our guidance range. What Joe said about the second fiscal quarter is that we expect to come in the midrange of our guidance and that the second half of the year, Qs three and four could potentially find single-digit revenue growth in one or both of those quarters and that collectively that would be consistent with coming in at the lower end of our guidance range on a full-year basis.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Okay, okay. Great, thank you. And Joe, maybe one question.", "Joe Saunders", "I want to add one thing. Because I did say that \u2013 if you\u2019re asking for the stress case, I did say that even in a downside scenario that saw only mid to high single-digit revenue growth in 2010, we could sustain our EPS and our operating margins.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Okay. That applies to 2009 as well?", "Joseph Saunders", "Yes.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Okay, got it. And then Joe, maybe one thing on integration, I mean where are we with extracting revenue and expense synergies from the consolidation of all the various regions? Thanks.", "Joe Saunders", "Where are we? I mean, I think to get to a point where you wake up and think everything is going pretty well, it is about a three-year process and I think we are probably further along than that kind of measurement makes you guess, but we are moving there and I think you can expect to see improvement in our expenses over the course of the year as we suggested.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Okay. Great, thank you", "Byron Pollitt", "At this point, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And for the last question, Bruce Harting, Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclays", "Rest of the world credit percentage growth in constant dollars stood reasonably flat quarter-over-quarter while U.S. continued to fall at a fairly rapid rate and you said through October actually credit turned negative. As you look forward into 2009 and early 2010, is it conceivable in terms of your saying that given the quarterly progression where you are saying middle of the range in second quarter, lower end of the range in second half next year that rest of the world credit and debit stays reasonable flat or are they just really lagging the U.S. in terms of the slowdown? And then just how low could U.S. get in terms of credit growth from previous downturns? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "This is Byron. Let me start by saying the growth rates we gave you for rest of the world payment volume growth were nominal not constant, and we recorded 25% payment volume growth nominal in the fourth quarter. And so, what we have indicated is that those have moderated down and that has been factored into the guidance that we have given. And I think Joe\u2019s answer to the last questions which outlined our stress case as someone described it, is how we are trying to be helpful on this subject. U.S. credit has turned negative but just and that\u2019s happened very few times in our history, even during recession. So we have tried to be helpful without guiding to very specific assumptions with regards to payment volume by line item. We have tried to be helpful by saying where we are positioning our revenue growth in each of our quarters, how we expect to end the year and then how we expect to map that into our earnings growth.", "Jack Carsky", "Okay, thank you all very much.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations.", "Jack Carsky", "Welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Joining us today are Joe Saunders, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website.  With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I\u2019m pleased to report that in spite of the ongoing challenges with the economy we began our fiscal 2009 with solid results across the board keeping in mind that our first quarter service revenue which represents approximately 40% of our total revenue is based on a one quarter lag.  Earnings, revenues and payment volumes all came in better than we anticipated going into the year.", "The resilience of our business could be seen in the contribution of our debit products in the US as consumers continue to more frequently use debit as a method of payment.  In addition we also saw growth in credit products outside the United States particularly in emerging markets.  That said the economic situation across the globe has had and will continue to have an effect on dollar payment volumes in the US and internationally for at least the next two to three quarters.", "On the other hand I should point out that Visa continues to benefit from growth in the number of transactions conducted over our network.  As a reminder approximately 30% of our revenue is derived from the absolute number of transactions that take place over VisaNet.  This volume grew 8% in the December quarter to almost 10 billion transactions demonstrating that even in severe economic times Visa continues to take volume from cash and checks.", "Now let me give you a brief overview of the financials for the quarter.  Once again with the one quarter service revenue lag in mind net operating revenues in the first quarter were just over $1.7 billion an increase of 17% over the year ago period and ahead of our guidance.  Operating margins which benefited from seasonal impact were strong as well and exceeded our stated full year guidance of the mid to high 40% range.", "Adjusted first quarter net income of $599 billion was 35% greater than the year ago period.  As I mentioned we are now seeing signs of a more pronounced decline in US payment volume growth and global cross border volumes than we had expected going into our fiscal year.  While we began 2009 with the expectation that revenue growth would slow to the high single digits in the back half of the year we are now projecting that growth to be in the low single digits.", "So our full year fiscal 2009 revenue now looks to be in the high single digits somewhere below our longer term guidance of 11% to 15%.  In our next fiscal quarter however we continue to expect revenue growth to be in the middle of the 11% to 15% guidance range as it benefits from a one time $70 million addition to incentives in the prior year.", "This means that the normalized second quarter growth rate is expected to be in the mid to high single digits further decelerating in the second half of the year to the low single digits.  On the positive side we are reducing expenses which based on the current trends we see for the year will help us meet our objective of 2009 diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%.", "Specifically we have accelerated our previously announced global integration effort.  As we continue to integrate our previously independent operating units we are reducing duplication and prioritizing our project funding including our marketing spend which we expect to be somewhat below the level of fiscal 2008.  As a result we are reaffirming our 2009 earnings per share and operating margin guidance.", "But let me be absolutely clear about our operating plan.  All of these efforts will be consistent with fully funding our growth initiatives.  Byron will provide additional detail on our guidance momentarily.", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2010 we are cautiously optimistic that we can regain our 11% to 15% revenue growth target assuming some recovery in the US economy and cross border volumes by early 2010 and the anticipated more favorable year-over-year comparisons on gas prices and foreign exchange rates.  On that basis we reaffirm all of our guidance for 2010.", "Additionally we expect to achieve our earnings per share and operating margin targets even if the revenue growth is somewhat below our guidance range.  To deliver these results in challenging times it is more critical than ever that we have the people and the mechanisms in place to effective engage our clients.", "We are focusing on their specific business needs and challenges and creating programs to help them build stronger and more profitable relationships with their customers.  As we make our business decisions we will thoughtfully consider how our actions may impact our clients\u2019 businesses.", "Of course we take nothing for granted but we believe this commitment to client service combined with our product and network strengths position us well particularly during a period of intense consolidation in the banking industry.  With that let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and our current thinking and financial guidance.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and then I\u2019ll touch on trends we are seeing for the quarter ending in December as well as some early results for January.  As Joe mentioned it was an encouraging start to 2009 with solid revenue and earnings growth keeping in mind that service revenues which represent almost 40% of revenue are reported on a one quarter lag.", "Total payment volume through the end of September, 2008 grew 12% to $701 billion over the same quarter of 2007.  During this time the US posted solid results growing 9% to $421 billion.  Broken down further debit delivered a strong 14% growth while credit continue to moderate and slowed to 3% from the prior period\u2019s 5%.  As a reminder our US payment volume is about equally distributed between debit and credit.", "On a constant dollar basis rest of world payment volume grew at 22% modestly higher than the 20% growth of the June quarter.  In contrast to the September ending quarter cross border volume growth in the December ending quarter slowed to zero on a constant dollar basis down from low double digits in the prior period.  This slowdown was broad based.  Globally which excludes Visa Europe total cards outstanding for the period ending September grew 10% with 1.7 billion cards carrying the Visa brand.", "Credit cards grew 6% to 812 million cards while debit rose 14% to 864 million cards.  Importantly international growth of 16% remains very healthy.  Card growth combined with ongoing efforts to broaden acceptance and usage represent a significant opportunity.  Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s which are reported with no quarterly lag totaled $9.8 billion in the first fiscal quarter an increase of 8% over the similar period a year ago.", "It is important to reiterate a point that Joe made at the beginning of this call.  While payment volume and average ticket sizes are moderating in the face of much more difficult economic times our transaction counts which are an important component of our net revenue are growing very well as the underlying secular shift to electronic payments and more precisely to Visa continues.", "Turning to the income statement in the first quarter gross revenues of $2 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2007.  Volume and support incentives increased by $19 million to $269 million which represented 13% of gross revenue moderately below our expectations coming into the year.", "Volume and support incentives are recognized based on current quarter results and this decline was almost entirely a function of lower fiscal first quarter payment volumes which in turn resulted in lower payments and accruals.  We expect that this dynamic will continue to provide some level of offset to lower revenue growth in our second quarter.", "Given our updated full year revenue projections we now expect 2009 volume and support incentives to be 14% to 16% of gross revenue down from our initial guidance of 16% to 17%.  Net operating revenues were just over $1.7 billion a 17% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2008.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $793 million up 8% over the prior year period and reflective of solid year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending September 30.  Data processing revenue reporting on a current quarter basis was $554 million up 13% over the prior year.", "International transaction revenues also reported on a current quarter basis were up 33% to $505 million as moderating cross border volumes in the period were offset by competitive pricing modifications.  Our adjusted operating margin which tends to be highest in our fiscal first quarter was approximately 48% above our full year guidance as Joe mentioned.", "In addition to seasonal impacts and better than anticipated expense savings the increase in margin was due to lower volume and support incentives which are recognized in the current quarter.  I\u2019ll provide additional color on our margin expectations in a moment.  On an adjusted basis operating expenses for the first quarter declined $29 million or 4% year-over-year driven by lower costs for personnel and professional fees as well as flat marketing spend.", "As Joe mentioned earlier our focus on costs is broad based and aimed at delivering the expense savings committed to by management during our IPO road show.  Please note that while we had originally guided to flat marketing spend in fiscal 2009 versus 2008 our current expectation is that the spending level will be somewhat below the level of 2008.", "Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter approximately $40 million of which was dedicated to the build out of our new data center.  The center will be fully operational by the fiscal fourth quarter.  Moving on to the balance sheet we ended the first quarter in excellent shape with very little debt and cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investments and restricted cash of $5.6 billion.", "Of this total $2.6 billion is restricted cash which represents an amount sufficient to fully fund the American Express and Discover settlement.  Two significant cash outflows are notable for the quarter.  First in mid-October we redeemed all of the Series 2 and a portion of the Series 3 Class C shares that were held by Visa Europe for a total of $2.7 billion resulting in a single class of C shares and the elimination of our pro forma approach to share count and earnings per share.", "All Class C shares are now translatable one to one into Class A equivalent shares.  Second at the end of December we delivered on our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders when Visa funded the litigation escrow by $1.1 billion directly from our cash balances instead of conducting an expensive follow on underwriting.  This had the same effect as a stock repurchase and reduced the amount of shares outstanding for EPS calculation purposes by 20.8 million shares.", "While there was little effect to the average share count in the first fiscal quarter the full effect will be realized in the second quarter and beyond.  As a result of these two transactions as of December 31st, 2008 Visa Inc. has 755 million Class A shares outstanding on an as converted basis and began the fiscal second quarter with a fully diluted Class share count of 756 million shares.", "Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the coming quarter and fiscal 2009.  While we expect to hit the middle of our 11% to 15% revenue guidance range in our fiscal second quarter in part due to a nonrecurring $70 million addition to incentives in the prior year the back half of 2009 is now looking to be more challenging than we expected going into the year.", "This will have ramifications to our revenue projections in the third and fourth quarters though we remain committed to delivering our full year earnings per share and operating margin guidance.  Specifically here in the US payment volume growth has declined from 9% in the September quarter to essentially flat in the December quarter.", "Deconstructing this further credit volume ended the period at a negative 6% while debit posted a 6% gain.  More recently through the end of January aggregate US payment volume growth is trending relatively flat.  Credit growth is negative in the mid single digits relatively unchanged form the December quarter and debit appears to have regained some momentum rising from positive low single digits in the month of December back to the mid single digit range in January.", "When you dig a little deeper into the underlying dynamics of these trends what we are seeing is that the steep in gas prices over the past several months has noticeably dampened payments growth despite notable growth rates in other categories of spend like recurring bill pay, quick service restaurants and health care.  All of these categories tend to favor debit over credit in this environment which underlies some of the resilience of that product.", "Net, net this leaves us cautiously optimistic that debit will continue to sustain respectable growth in this tougher economic environment.  Outside the United States for the quarter ending December, 2008 constant dollar payment volume growth rates declined from the low 20s to the mid teens.  As mentioned earlier cross border volumes were flat in the December ending quarter and in January have declined to negative mid single digits.", "Now let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it may impact our current guidance.  As Joe previously mentioned on a full year basis we are projecting total net revenue to come in below the lower end of our 11% to 15% guidance range in the high single digits.", "While we still expect to achieve the middle of our 11% to 15% guidance range in the fiscal second quarter the third and fourth quarters are now shaping up to be more challenging than we had signaled last quarter with the probability of low single digit growth.  This second half outlook also encompasses a more pronounced foreign exchange impact which on a year-over-year basis is expected to reduce revenue growth by about three percentage points.", "Despite the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter we are maintaining our long term guidance of the mid to high 40% range for adjusted operating margin through 2010.  Though we should continue to realize incremental savings from our merger and cost initiatives given the pressure on revenues in the back half of the year the general uncertainty around the economy and our intention to continue investing for future growth we are staying with our current range.", "More importantly and to reiterate Joe\u2019s statement we remain on track to deliver our guidance of annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20% for 2009.  Looking beyond 2009 assuming some US economic recovery by early 2010 as well as more favorable comparisons particularly in cross border activity, gas prices and foreign exchange rates we expect to achieve our earnings per share and operating margin guidance.", "That concludes my comments so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Let me conclude by saying that it\u2019s important to remember that Visa\u2019s business in the US while vital to the company is only one part of a large and growing global enterprise.  Despite the current economic headwinds our international growth opportunities both in credit and debit continue to offer us very attractive longer term prospects as economies expand and mature and payment systems evolve around the globe.", "When the economy of the US does turn for the better the actions we are taking now on expenses, on new product development in both credit and debit and on international expansion will pay enormous dividends over the long term.  Thank you all for listening and with that we are ready to take questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Regarding the \u201ccompetitive pricing changes\u201d around cross border I was wondering if you could just characterize how that plays with the regulators over there considering the environment particularly in Europe and my second question is can you characterize the level of your marketing spend that\u2019s tied to contractual obligations versus what\u2019s completely discretionary?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "To begin with the pricing changes that we\u2019re talking about were made several quarters ago and they\u2019re being manifested in what we do now.  This isn\u2019t a recent action.  In the second regard the majority of our marketing spending is discretionary not non-discretionary.  If that continues to be the case I would say that the traction that we\u2019re getting on marketing spend is mostly related to the efficiency of what we\u2019re doing today as opposed to what we did a year ago when we were a new company.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Which includes the recent consolidation of agencies?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Yes, the consolidation of agencies and frankly the lower cost of different types of media.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Appreciate the commentary on the December volumes in the US.  It\u2019s actually a bit better than we expected.  I was just curious, it looks like US payment volume is tracking closer to retail sales than it has in the past.  It sounded like it was flat, still a premium but not as big as the usual secular premium that we would see.", "I guess I was trying to better understand what do you think is driving that reduction in the premium?  Is it really just lower average tickets and gas influencing that?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "To a certain extent it\u2019s modestly lower average tickets which is related to the economy in general.  Quick service restaurants and categories like that are increasing more rapidly than high end retail or travel or airlines.  Having said that, fuel prices have a significant impact on our payment volume growth in the short run.  If you go back through last October gas prices steadily increased to well over $4 a gallon.", "Depending on what week you\u2019re looking at they\u2019re around $1.70 a gallon right now, so there\u2019s a huge drop in the price of gas and gas accounts for about 10% of our total payment volume across both categories.  So you have 10% of your volume where the cost of a gallon of gas is off by 40%, 45%.  That obviously will not be the case in 2010 assuming everything stays the way it is you can do the numbers but it makes a difference in our growth rate.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Did you see any noticeable change in average tickets or I guess the number of flights in the US in December?  We got the volume data but I was just curious if you saw a similar trend in transaction counts.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I think as we said we saw the number of transactions go up at a pretty strong high single digit rate, I think we just said 8%, but the average ticket size in the aggregate is down by 5% I think.  Not all of that is fuel but fuel is a considerable hunk of it.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Yes, because we\u2019ve been trying to focus more on transaction counts.  I\u2019ll end by asking just to confirm the data processing line is primarily transaction based, correct, not volume based?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "That\u2019s correct.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "100% transaction based.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "We\u2019re very pleased with the number of transactions going through our system in this period of time and frankly you can\u2019t look at it and not think that we\u2019re doing what we set out to do which is to compete with cash and checks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "I wanted to ask a question just to start off with, we\u2019re getting more inquiries from investors trying to separate cyclical and secular trends here.  Obviously the cyclical part of the growth equation is getting a little bit more challenging which I don\u2019t think is surprising to anyone, but can you talk a little bit about the confidence level in the secular piece?", "There\u2019s obviously a lot of views out there that the days of easy credit are over and the consumer does go into a period of more sane deleveraging with an increased personal savings rate.  To what extent do you guys think about that potential dynamic as you shape the outlook over the next year or so?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "To begin with if you look at our combined debit and credit volume, 95% of the volume that goes through our system comes from people that use debit cards which don\u2019t have a credit limit or in those cases where it is a credit card from people that either pay their bill in full every month or occasionally revolve and never revolve at more than 50% of their line.  So part of the answer is a lot of the volume that we have is not generated by people that are borrowing a lot of money.", "We\u2019ve got to keep reminding ourselves and everybody else that the growth in receivables in the credit card business has a lot to do with balance transfers in the acquisition of new accounts.  Balance transfers, those loans that are created as a result of the balance transfers never go through our system.  Those are transactions that are handled outside of Visa\u2019s system, if you will, so while they may come under a Visa branded product, they are not Visa volume to us.", "Having said that, it\u2019s clear that things are more difficult than they used to be and it\u2019s clear that our volumes are down as a result of the economy in the US and economies around the world although as we said our credit card volumes in some emerging countries remain quite strong.", "On the other hand our transactions are up and they appear to be up because we appear to be taking share from cash and checks in categories in the quick service restaurants, in the bill paying categories which are often larger dollar amount transactions, in supermarkets and wholesale retail chains and so forth and so on.", "I think that the answer that encourages me the most is if things begin to turn around even modestly we have structured ourselves to be poised to take advantage of it in a serious way.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "That commentary is great and I think Adam has a follow up question for you.", "Adam Frisch - UBS Securities", "Byron you were pretty clear that your expense reduction program would not interfere in your growth initiatives but is it also logical to think that once top line growth recovers at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later, you won\u2019t have to add back at least the bulk of these expenses?  I guess another way to ask it is what you\u2019re cutting now, does it have to be added back later once revenue growth re-accelerates?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "I think we made clear from the beginning that not all of the savings that we would realize as a result of the merger would be flowed through to the bottom line and that we stand ready to reinvest a portion of those savings in new products and growth initiatives and that remains true.  I think to help ground everyone as Joe indicated the margin for the first fiscal quarter is typically our highest throughout the fiscal year.", "We would expect margins to moderate through the balance of the year which is why frankly we are holding on margin guidance to mid to high 40%.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I would only add to that in relation to the question you asked, are the expenses that we are saving going to show back up when the economy gets better, the answer is no, they will not show up.  They\u2019re going away.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Julio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "My question is really just I want to focus more on pricing and I know that we\u2019ve heard a lot of commentary, chatter, I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of folks out there that pricing increases are coming from Visa, MasterCard, prepare for that and I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand more than anything else, even if there were some pricing increases not necessarily the magnitude but where exactly should we be thinking about how each one of those pieces would flow through the revenue items?", "I guess if you could focus more on things like the card services line, the data processing fees and the cross border, how do we break out where or if you could provide a way to think about where those increases would really actually manifest themselves in the model?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I think in the short run I just suggested in my talk that we\u2019re going to be very careful about what we do given the fragile state of the bottom line of our clients particularly in the US.  While I\u2019m not going to say we will do nothing, what we will do will be in concert with our partners and it will be done in a thoughtful, I think we\u2019ve said a thoughtful, surgical way and we\u2019re not going to back off that.  That\u2019s not where we believe our greatest opportunity lies.", "Julio Quinteros, Jr. - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Maybe in terms of the model itself, maybe Byron you could comment on thinking about the line items, where would it actually show up in the model if there were to be anything like that?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "The way we\u2019ve tried to be helpful is to elevate to an overall level of revenue guidance in combination with margin.  I think we\u2019ve said from the beginning that in our first 12 to 18 months as a public company, as a merged entity, we had a lot of practices and a lot of opportunity to standardize and optimize our business across the globe.  We are doing that and will basically have a non-normalized rate of growth through this year.", "But as we move beyond this year, again as we\u2019ve said before, that the vast majority of our revenue growth should be attributive to taking share from cash and check and growing our business with transactions and a higher penetration of PCV.  We actually expect pricing to be a much more moderated impact over time on our revenue growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Kissane - Banc of America Securities.", "James Kissane - Banc of America Securities", "Byron, just following up on that, what portion of your revenue growth this year will be from the price increase?  And then maybe just a quick follow up, when will the cross border pricing adjustments anniversary?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "Let\u2019s start with the second.  The cross border pricing adjustment you\u2019re referring to were initiated in fiscal Q3 of 2008 so they will anniversary at the midway point of this fiscal year which is a contributing factor to our guiding down revenue growth in the second half.", "With regards to how much revenue is tied to price adjustments, that\u2019s not something that we have spoken to publicly and again we\u2019ve tried to be helpful by giving in this case relatively specific revenue guidance by quarter for all of 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "One of the premises on which you\u2019re basing the 2010 outlook is a thought that maybe we find the bottom here at least in the US economy in 2009 and at least in credit volume.  Is there anything anecdotally or otherwise that you see out there that makes you feel comfortable with that kind of projection?  Is it the disconnect between the view of restriction of credit and the type of customer or the type of transaction that flows through the network?", "Or is there something else that makes you feel like that\u2019s something that we should be thinking about?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "Let me respond first by saying this is not a projection.  What we have said is that if the economy in the US has some degree of recovery in early fiscal year 2010 in combination with some recovery of cross border in addition to more favorable comparisons specifically with gas prices and FX rates then we are confident that we will resume our revenue guidance of 11% to 15% growth.", "The way we\u2019re trying to be helpful here is if there, under those circumstances, we feel very comfortable in projecting revenue growth back into our guidance range.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Let me be just a little bit more specific.  I don\u2019t know when the economy in the world is going to recover.  When Byron suggests that there needs to be some recovery, that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying.  If there is by around the first quarter of 2010, then I think we\u2019re in good shape.  As it relates to the foreign exchange and the gas prices we\u2019re considerably more certain that that will happen so it\u2019s really a mix of the two.", "Remember I don\u2019t [need] the economy to recover to a point of where I have to get to the revenue guidance to continue to deliver the 20% earnings per share.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "As a follow up on contra-revenue it sounds like you\u2019re getting a little more constructive there, I guess, relative to your net revenue growth.  Should we actually begin to see support and incentive payments fall as a percent of volume at some point in 2009?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "The way we\u2019ve articulated that is as a percent of gross revenue.  Going into the year we had guided volume and support as a percent of gross revenue at 16% to 17%.  Because growth has been a bit less than anticipated as a percentage of grows revenue that has fallen to in this case 13% for the quarter.  Then we adjusted our guidance to 14% to 16% on a full year basis.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "We don\u2019t expect it to remain that low.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Just a quick follow up on that last question, the 13% this quarter in the volume and support incentives, I assume that in your guidance for fiscal \u201909 is based on volumes staying relatively consistent with where they were in the fourth quarter in January.", "You\u2019ve taken it a leg down.  Does that line item have more potential to drop and could it conceivably be as low as 10% of revenues or is it not that sensitive to volume falls?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Let me start out by reminding you that the incentives are booked on a current quarter basis and the revenues on a lag basis.  You\u2019re talking about service revenues up to October and you\u2019re talking about incentive expense on a real time basis that occurred in the ensuing quarter.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "And I would just add to that, that the way the incentives would respond would be with diminishing returns.  If payment volume growth was continued to slow there would be a diminishing dampening effect by incentives over time.  It\u2019s not linear.  The flipside to that is once you begin annualizing that and you have recovery, you have the same phenomena on the uptick that incentives will start to come back as growth in payment volumes begin to recover.", "Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Your guidance for, in your commentary around cross border, it sounds like cross border did get worse in the month of January and once we hit the second quarter for running negative singles, did you like you were in January on terms of volumes we\u2019re going to see that in terms of revenues as well because pricing is going to anniversary.", "Is that in your guidance already, the negative cross border revenues by the second half of \u201909?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Everything that we know is in the guidance that we\u2019re giving you today.  There is nothing that we\u2019ve talked about that we haven\u2019t thoughtfully considered in putting together the comments that we put together today.  It doesn\u2019t suggest that things can get worse, but we have considered everything that we\u2019re looking to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank North America.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank North America", "I guess just following up on that last question, maybe you could give a little more granularity on the slowdown.  Is it broad based or could you touch on your major regions and specify if some regions are dragging down the overall volume numbers more than others?  Then also a quick follow up, I don\u2019t know did you give the process transaction growth for January?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "With regards to regional granularity when the economic melees began to set in, different regions entered that zone at different time frames but I think it\u2019s fair to say today it\u2019s broad based.  All our regions are experiencing declines, all the regions contributed to the reduction in growth in cross border.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "That\u2019s true about cross border but we have seen transaction and payment volume growth in several of our emerging countries in some of our regions outside the United States.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "We have some countries that are excepting.  On transactions processed we didn\u2019t give the January number.  Our practice is to give it at the quarter which we will do at the next earnings call and that\u2019ll be for all three months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Donald Fendetti - Citigroup.", " Donald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup", "Joe, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your debit expansion in Asia in terms of timing and your outlook there?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "As you know we\u2019ve just begun a joint venture in Asia and we are in business, we have a number of clients in queue and over the next 24 to 36 months we think that that\u2019ll be a pretty valuable operation that will generate more than noticeable revenues.  That\u2019s how we\u2019re starting to push debit out in Asia.  We have debit initiatives going in other parts of the world.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Moshe Katri - Cowen and Co.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Co.", "Can you break down payment and transaction growth by regions, US, Europe, Asia Pacific?  I think these are numbers that you gave us last quarter and then could you elaborate a bit more on your cost cutting initiatives I guess with the exception of advertising?  Are we focusing more aggressively on personnel, systems, data centers, etc.?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I\u2019ll the answer the second question then Byron will answer the first question.  As it relates to the second question what I said was that we are executing on what we said we would execute on in the IPO and that is to de-mutualize the company and to eliminate duplications and wind up focusing on implementing projects that make sense to the business and eliminating those things that were extraneous or duplicative.", "That is exactly what we\u2019re doing.  One of the fallouts of that of course is that we\u2019re reducing our headcounts in certain places as it relates to this duplication, but that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re doing.  We\u2019re putting together a company that is effective, efficient and focused and we\u2019re doing what we should be doing and we\u2019re doing what we promised we\u2019d be doing.", "It happens to coincide with a period of time where it\u2019s extremely appropriate and important that we get about the business of doing that and getting it done and that\u2019s what we\u2019re committing we will do.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "With regards to transactional data by region, let me refer you to our website and we will have posted today for the period ending September 30th all the detailed statistics of which transaction by region are included and are available for you to access.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Co.", "Just to verify, did you say that average ticket prices were down 5%?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "No, we did not.  We didn\u2019t give any specific quantitative on average tickets.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "Joe said it was about 5% in aggregate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Joe, I guess I just want a little bit more clarity on that 2010 guidance.  Is there a base level of revenue growth in that year that would lead you to believe that 20% EPS growth is still achievable?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "We\u2019re pretty confident at this point but without knowing in absolute terms what\u2019s going to happen that the things we know will change off of the base line that we expect in the third and the fourth quarter will get us to where we need to go.  We think it could get us back up to the 11% to 15% range.  We think it could fall short of that and still deliver the 20% earnings per share.", "You could stress test it all the way down the hill, but we\u2019re reasonably confident that we\u2019re in pretty good shape knowing what we know now.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "Just to build on that a moment, we guided in the second half of the fiscal year to a probability of low single digit revenue growth.  As Joe mentioned earlier what we do know is where gas prices have been and what we will anniversary in terms of gas pricing.  We also expect to favorably anniversary the change in FX.", "We then went on to say that in order to get back into our revenue guidance range, that we would depend on at least some recovery in cross border and some recovery in the US.  Joe went on to say that even if we underperformed our revenue guidance somewhat, we could still hit 20% or better EPS growth.  That\u2019s how we\u2019ve tried to frame it for you all.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "So we could think maybe high single digits still achievable, maybe below a little bit?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "I think we\u2019ve given you a pretty good frame.  You should take it from there.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "On capital management, I was wondering where we were with that?  I think you guys still have a fair amount of cash.  Any intentions of instituting another share repurchase above and beyond the 1.1?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "As I mentioned earlier in the remarks we did 1.1 billion of share repurchase in the month of December and we have ample opportunity to go back to our Board to seek additional authorization at a time and an amount that management feels appropriate.", "Jack Carsky", "Stacy, we probably have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "I just want to make sure the foreign exchange effect on revenue, I think you said in the back of the year was only 3%.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "In the back half of the year we said that it was three full percentage points of impact on growth.  That\u2019s on the company\u2019s entire growth rate.  That\u2019s currently the ballpark that we\u2019re contemplating.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "The change in currencies, the dramatic change we saw over the last 90 days, the net effect of that is only 300 basis points on the growth rate?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "On the year-over-year growth rate.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "The effect on profitability?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "In the way that we hedge we hedge the economic exposure so revenue less expenses is an income exposure, we hedge the income.  From an economic standpoint that\u2019s hedged.  When we gave the guidance for 20% or better EPS growth that\u2019s on an as reported basis.  The foreign exchange impacts are fully contemplated in that guidance.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "I want to make sure I heard this right, you said fuel was before the decline in fuel prices was 10% of all spending on your card?  That\u2019s higher than I\u2019d heard from other.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr.", "Joe said about 10% in the US.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "Last question, there was a major security breach in the industry here in the US and I think that there is the risks of security breaches in the industry are going up.  I was wondering if you could comment on that and how concerned you are about that and what economic effects you think the security breach that is out there could have on various players in the industry?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Obviously we\u2019re aware of it and obviously we\u2019re involved in the correction of it and obviously we\u2019re concerned that it happened.  We believe that we have made a considerable amount of progress through PCI for lack of a better term to mitigate the possibility that these things happen.  There have been some that have occurred but frankly not many.", "Having said that, to us one of the most important things is that in that regard we have promised consumers that they will never be financially liable for anything like this occurring to them.  That is totally in tact and consumers can feel comfortable using Visa cards and comfortable in the notion that no security breach will ever financially affect them.  I think that this is the most important thing.", "We\u2019ve got to work on making sure that nobody in the process gets hurt but our promise is the consumer and the confidence is directed at the consumer and I\u2019m happy to say that that continues to be 100% in effect.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you all very much.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.", "", "Joseph Saunders", "", "Thanks Jack. Thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. To begin with I am very pleased to report that our fiscal second quarter results were consistent with the guidance and expectations we provided in our last quarter\u2019s earnings call. Despite the challenging global economy, Visa delivered strong operational and financial performance benefiting from its diverse product set, our intense focus on expense management and the underlying worldwide secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment which continues unabated. ", "Our operating net revenues in the second quarter were over $1.6 billion, an increase over 13% over the year-ago period and right in line with our guidance this quarter. Our adjusted operating margin of 55% which benefited from our ongoing efficiency drive was solid as well and exceeded our stated full-year guidance of the mid to high 40% range. ", "Finally, adjusted second quarter net income of $553 million was 38% greater than the year-ago period. Looking forward from a macro standpoint the world economy continues to slow and while Visa is resilient it is not immune. Aggregate payment volume growth in our international regions in the December quarter were a positive mid double digit rate and preliminary volume trends through March suggest only a modest decline since then. ", "This of course will be reflected in our fiscal third quarter service revenues. ", "There continues to be regional bright spots around the globe where the trends are holding up even more substantially. In the U.S. specifically, payment growth declined to approximately a 1% negative rate to the December quarter and we saw little change through the March quarter. We are encouraged that in aggregate over the five month period through April we have seen some stabilization in U.S. payment volumes. ", "Of course the more than 30% rate of decline in the year-over-year price of gasoline has resulted in difficult year-over-year comparables which will continue for the next few months before finally abating as we move into fiscal 2010. Importantly, all of the results we have achieved today are in spite of foreign currency headwinds which we also expect to abate by the beginning of fiscal 2010. ", "The underlying resilience of our business was evident from the contribution of debit credits in the U.S. which Visa pioneered in the mid 1990\u2019s. Debit in the U.S. posted growth in each month of the March quarter as well as through the month of April. The continued strength of debt is attributable in part to that product\u2019s strong correlation with non-discretionary spending categories which are holding up relatively well in the face of a tough economy. ", "In fact, in the quarter ended in December for the first time in Visa\u2019s history the U.S. debit payment volumes eclipsed that of credit, an important milestone in the history of our business and a testament to the diversity of our product. Process transaction growth was resilient as well, posting gains of 6% through the end of March with even better performance through this point in the month of April. ", "Before touching on our near term outlook let me underscore several important things that I think you should take away from this call. ", "Our financial performance in fiscal 2009 is holding consistent with our expectations and guidance and reflects appropriate funding of all of our growth initiatives. Our business model has proven resilient in the face of today\u2019s economic challenges. Transaction growth led by debit has continued unabated in part driven by the secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment. This global shift in spending behavior is also being driven by Visa whose product innovation, expansion of payment categories and focused global advertising that moves consumers to want to transact at point of sale with Visa products. ", "With the global economy having some impact on revenue growth, Visa\u2019s management team remains focused on delivering margins and adjusted earnings per share growth outlined during our IPO road show. We have therefore accelerated merger related cost efficiencies which have fully offset the shortfalls in revenue growth. ", "In the near-term the continuing challenge in cross-border payment volumes, foreign exchange and gas price headwinds and lapping price increases will have a negative effect on the back half of our fiscal year. For this reason, we still expect low single digit revenue growth in our fiscal third quarter although the fourth quarter should now be higher based on several factors including planned strategic pricing actions recently announced. With this in mind we are confident in achieving the high single digit revenue range for all of fiscal 2009. ", "With the anticipated contribution from expense savings we are on target to meet our 2009 diluted earnings per share growth guidance of greater than 20%. Given the fiscal year-to-date results and our adjusted operating margin we are taking the full year 2009 guidance up modestly from currently mid to high 40\u2019s range to the low 50\u2019s range. Additionally, we are taking 2010 adjusted operating margins to the high 40\u2019s to low 50% range. Byron will touch on this further in a moment. ", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2010 we are not changing the outlook we shared with you last quarter. We continue to be cautiously optimistic we can regain our 11-15% revenue growth target assuming some recovery in the U.S. economy and cross-border volumes by early 2010 and we expect more favorable year-over-year comparison on gas prices and foreign exchange rates. We expect to achieve or earnings per share and adjusted operating margin targets even if revenue growth is somewhat below our guidance range. ", "Finally, we continue to focus on fine service given the historic times in the banking sector and the broader economy. Consolidations in the banking industry may continue and Visa expects to be the beneficiary of this activity. We will do so by remaining committed to providing our clients with products and programs that move their businesses forward and add value to their customers. ", "Debit and our prepaid platform as well a money transfer and new technologies for payment at the point of sale will continue to differentiate Visa from the rest of the payments industry. ", "With that let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the financial results and our current thinking on the financial guidance. ", "Byron Pollitt ", "", "Thank you Joe. As is now our custom let me begin with the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and then I will touch on trends we are seeing for the quarter ending in March as well as some early results for April. ", "As Joe mentioned it was a solid fiscal second quarter with strong revenue and earnings growth remembering that service revenues which represent 41% of our gross revenue are reported on a one-quarter lag. Total payment volume growth for Visa, Inc. through the end of December 2008 in nominal dollars was a negative 1% falling to $675 billion over the same quarter in 2007. In the U.S. debit delivered a solid 6% growth while credit was a negative 7%. In the December quarter for the first time in our history U.S. debit payment volume eclipsed that of credit volume although credit still remains the payment vehicle of choice internationally. ", "On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% moderating from the 22% growth exhibited in the September quarter but still solidly positive, a further recognition of the secular resiliency of plastic in many emerging and developing economies. As a reminder, cross-border volume growth in the December ending quarter slowed to zero on a constant dollar basis, down from low double digits in the prior period. The slow down was broad based. Through the end of March it continued its decline and ended the period at a negative 6% constant dollar growth rate. ", "Excluding Visa Europe, globally total cards outstanding for the period ending December grew 8% with just over 1.7 billion cards carrying the Visa brand. Credit cards grew 2% to 813 million cards while debit rose 14% to 905 million cards. Debit card growth, primarily in the United States was positively affected by prepaid gift card programs that are obviously very popular around the December holidays. ", "International card growth of 13% remains very healthy as well. Overall credit card growth in the U.S. has slowed as the result of re-trenchment in credit card marketing programs but this slow down is being more than offset by gains internationally. ", "Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network which are reported on a real-time basis totaled $9.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 6% over the similar period a year ago. It is important to reiterate a point we made last quarter and Joe touched on earlier. While payment volume and average ticket sizes have continued to moderate, our processed transactions which represent approximately 28% of our gross revenue continue to post solid growth as the underlying secular shift to electronic payments and more precisely to Visa continues. ", "Turning to the income statement, in the second quarter gross revenues of $1.9 billion were up 8% from the similar period in 2008. Volume and support incentives decreased by $43 million to $295 million representing 15% of gross revenue, in line with our full-year expectation with a range of 14-16% of gross revenue. As you know, volume and support incentives are recognized based on current quarter results. ", "The year-over-year decline was the result of lower 2009 fiscal second quarter payment volume growth as well as the effect of a one-time $70 million non-recurring charge in last year\u2019s quarter partially offset by new contractual adjustments in the current quarter.  Net operating revenues were just over $1.6 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the second fiscal quarter 2008 and right in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $804 million, up 2% over the prior year period and reflective of moderating year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending December 31. Data processing revenue, reported on a current quarter basis was $544 million, up 10% over the prior year as processed transaction growth remains solid. International transaction revenue, also reported on a current quarter basis, were up 18% to $446 million as moderating cross-border volumes in the period were offset by competitive pricing modifications enacted during the fiscal third quarter of 2008. ", "Our adjusted operating margin was approximately 55%, above our stated mid to high 40% guidance as Joe mentioned. The increase in margin was due to lower volume and support incentives which are recognized in the current quarter as well as certain expenses shifting from our second fiscal quarter into the back half of the year. I will provide additional color on our future margin expectations in a moment. ", "On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the second quarter declined $38 million or 5% year-over-year driven by lower costs across the board with the exception of network and EDT. Our focus one expense reduction is broad-based and is driven by merger related efficiencies. All of our long-term product investments are being prudently funded. While some expenses will increase in the back half of the year such as marketing, these are anticipated and are fully consistent with our guidance. ", "Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter, approximately $33 million of which were dedicated to the build out of our new data center. The center was partially brought on line in March and will be fully operational by the end of our fiscal fourth quarter. We anticipate the associated depreciation and amortization costs in the second half of the year to be about $12 million.

Of this total, $2.1 billion is restricted cash which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express and Discover settlements. ", "We also recently announced our intent to unlock up to 30% of the outstanding Class C shareholdings which will help alleviate some of the share overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011. Conversion and sale of these shares will increase our public float but will have no dilutive impact on our shares outstanding. As mentioned in our press release we are filing a shelf registration that will allow us the flexibility to quickly access the capital markets with either equity or debt instruments. The proceeds of any future transaction could be used for a variety of reasons but at this point in time we have no plans or reasons to go to market. This action is nothing more than proactive capital structure planning. ", "Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the coming quarter and fiscal 2009. As we said last quarter we expect the back half of 2009 to be more challenging from a revenue standpoint and this continues to be our view. Specifically here in the U.S., payment volume growth has declined from a negative 1% growth rate in the December quarter to a negative 2% growth in the March quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume growth ended the period at a negative 10% while debit volume growth continued in positive territory posting a 5% gain. ", "More recently through the 28th of April aggregate U.S. payment volume growth has trended back to a negative 1% growth rate. Credit growth continues at a negative 10% while debit growth has regained some momentum rising from a positive 5% in the March period to a positive 7% April month to date. ", "Regardless of the potential impact of an Easter shift, these growth trends are encouraging and consistent with performance we have seen over the past four months. As further perspective, certain categories of spend like gasoline, airlines and lodging continue to be challenged especially as they relate to credit volumes. On the other hand, recurring bill pay, quick serving restaurants, healthcare and super markets continue to grow very nicely. These categories tend to favor debit over credit, even more so in this environment which is the foundation of some of the resilience of that product. ", "On balance, as Joe mentioned earlier, over the past several months we are seeing in aggregate some stabilization in the U.S. payment volume growth trends. Having said that we do not know for certain whether we are seeing an inflection point. Outside the U.S. for the quarter ending March 2009 we expect constant dollar payment volume growth rates to be solidly positive but to decline modestly from their levels at the end of December. ", "As mentioned earlier, cross-border volumes in constant volumes were flat in the December ending quarter and in the March ending quarter have declined to negative mid single digits. Month to date in April we have seen similar results. Processed transaction growth ended the March period at 6% while month to date in April has reached 9% also a testament to the strength and resilience of debit as a greater percentage of processed transactions are debit based. ", "Now let me comment on what we see over the coming year as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it may affect our current guidance. ", "Based on our second quarter results and our improved balance of year outlook we are confident about delivering net revenue growth in the high single digits and as Joe said we continue to expect revenue growth in the third quarter in the low single digits while the fourth is projected to be modestly higher. Also as a reminder, this second half outlook encompasses a more pronounced negative foreign exchange impact which on a year-over-year basis is now expected to reduce revenue growth by about 4 percentage points in each quarter. ", "Given the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter we are adjusting up our 2009 guidance to the low 50% range. For 2010 recognizing the general uncertainty around the economy, our attention to continuing investing for future growth and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expenses we are moving our guidance from mid to high 40\u2019s to the high 40\u2019s low 50\u2019s range. ", "Most importantly, and to reiterate Joe\u2019s statement, we remain on track to deliver our guidance of annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of greater than 20% for 2009. ", "Looking to 2010 given the scenario that includes some recovery in the U.S. economy and in cross-border travel, combined with more favorable comparisons in gas prices and foreign exchange rates we would expect to exceed 20% earnings per share growth. ", "That concludes my comments so I will turn the call back over to Joe. ", "Joseph Saunders ", "", "Let me conclude by saying that while the economy continues to present challenges, Visa remains in a strong position to weather the storm and more importantly realize operating advantages when the economy does finally turn around. We have and continue to lay the ground work for an effective and efficient expense structure, we are making the proper investments in products and processes to drive incremental growth in the future and most importantly we continue to work with our clients to provide them the best possible credit and debit products and processing solutions to meet their business needs.

It certainly doesn\u2019t make sense to over-advertise in an environment where there is going to be less credit usage for instance, as an example. There is a lot of other things.

There was only one really bad quarter during the SARS epidemic and then it was totally back within four quarters and actually after the one bad quarter it went back up about 50%. Now nothing says this is going to be the same kind of activity but the other very important thing to remember is a considerable number of people as we have continued to remind everybody in our quarterly reports have already stopped traveling.

Therefore, proactively we wanted to begin unlocking those shares early to release some of the pressure that otherwise would have occurred in 2011. 30% or roughly 45 million C shares have the opportunity to unlock between July 1 of this year through September 30. When we say unlock that means that the banks that own them have the opportunity to sell them. It doesn\u2019t mean they will sell them. It means they have the opportunity to sell them.

It is totally talking about using a debit card to buy a pizza, to go to the aquarium, to get a song on your iPod and any one of a number of things instead of using a check or instead of using cash.

First that in early fiscal year 2010 there would be some recovery in U.S. payment volume or the U.S. economy and cross-border travel. Recovery means that we are starting to see some year-over-year growth. Recovery is not a lower decelerating. Recovery is some year-over-year growth. We know that in the first fiscal quarter, the quarter beginning in October we know that was the quarter where gas prices took a significant reduction from where the had been through most of 2008 and we also know that during that quarter is when the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably against an array of currencies.

Good afternoon and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Thanks, Jack and thank you all for joining us. To begin, I am pleased to report that our fiscal third quarter results were once again consistent with the guidance and expectations we provided during our second quarter earnings call. Despite the ongoing challenges in the economy, Visa delivered a solid operational and financial performance as we continued to benefit from our diverse product set, our ongoing commitment to expense management, and of course the underlying worldwide secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment. ", "Earnings for the third quarter on an adjusted basis were $0.98 per diluted share, and were positively impacted by the sale of our 10% equity ownership in Visa Net Brazil. On an adjusted pro forma basis that excludes this gain, Visa earned $0.67 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the year-ago period. This puts us on target towards meeting our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of better than 20% growth. ", "Our net operating revenues in the third quarter were over $1.6 billion, a modest increase over the year-ago period and in line with our previous guidance for low single-digit growth. ", "Partly, we were able to achieve this result while incurring elevated volume and support incentives which were due to the successful resigning of numerous clients during the quarter, a situation we do not expect to repeat at these levels. ", "Our adjusted operating margin was 51% for the quarter as we continued to benefit from our ongoing efficiency drive. ", "Finally, adjusted third quarter net income was $744 million. Absent the gain from Visa Net Brazil sale, it was $507 million, an 11% increase over the year-ago period. ", "Our fiscal quarter picked up pretty much where we left off in the second quarter. We have seen no signs that a sustained turnaround in the U.S. is occurring. There are, however, positive incremental exceptions which speak to the resiliency of Visa\u2019s business model and the value Visa offers around the globe. ", "U.S. payment volume growth declined to a 3% negative rate in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged that since the beginning of the calendar year, payment volume growth has remained in a relatively tight range around a negative 2% to 4%. ", "Of note in the U.S., the more than 30% decline in the year-over-year price of gasoline continues to make for difficult year-over-year comparables. Absent this headwind in the latest quarter, we would have seen slightly positive growth. However, we still expect this headwind to abate as we move into the first quarter of our fiscal 2010. ", "On the other hand, in spite of the global nature of the recession, aggregate payment volume growth in our international regions, which is primarily driven by credit, was positive on a constant currency basis in the March quarter and has remained positive in the high-single-digits through the end of June, albeit at a lower level than earlier in the year. ", "Total transactions generating data processing fees were $10.3 billion for the June quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period as the migration to electronic payments continues on a global basis. ", "As I did last quarter, let me underscore and reiterate several important themes you should take away from our most recent quarter and this call. Our financial performance in fiscal 2009 continues to unfold consistent with our expectations and more importantly, it reflects the appropriate funding of all of our growth initiatives. ", "We believe that we are planting the right seeds and making the proper investments in the business to come out of this recession in an even stronger position than we entered it. ", "Our business model, while not unaffected, has proven resilient in the face of today\u2019s economic challenges. Transaction growth led by debit has continued unabated, in part driven by the secular shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment. ", "Visa is also driving this global shift in spending behavior through its reliability and accessibility, product innovation, expansion of payment categories, and focused global advertising that moves consumers to want to transact at the point of sale with Visa products. ", "In fact, the early results from our Go campaign first rolled out in April of this year are exceeding our initial expectations in terms of increased consumer awareness and brand [linkage], providing a level of optimism that the campaign is contributing to our strong debit transaction growth. ", "On the positive side, based on current trends we are now anticipating a slightly better fiscal fourth quarter. We believe that the low-single-digit expectation we previously guided to is more likely to be in the mid-single-digit range. This leaves us quite confident in achieving the high-single-digit revenue range for all of fiscal 2009. ", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, we continue to believe that we can regain our 11% to 15% annual net revenue growth target based on the assumptions we shared with you last quarter. The more favorable year-over-year comparison on gas prices and foreign exchange rates and the start of some recovery in the U.S. economy and cross-border volumes by early 2010. ", "We also continue to believe that we are able to achieve our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin targets even if the revenue growth was somewhat below the guidance range. ", "Now let me touch on some of the recent successes we\u2019ve had on the client front. As we\u2019ve discussed with you for several quarters now, consolidations in the banking industry have changed the landscape and market share of many of our largest customers. Given the strength of our client relationships and our products, we anticipated being a net beneficiary of this consolidation and I can now say with certainty that we have delivered on that expectation. ", "In our third fiscal quarter, we resigned a significant number of long-term contracts, 11 of which collectively account for 26% of our global volume and 34% of our U.S. volume. Some of these contracts were accelerated renewals and were precipitated by bank consolidation. ", "With these signings, we now have no major contracts up for renewal in the next two years and have over 75% of our worldwide payment volume under contract. We are obviously pleased about our long-term prospects and are well-positioned to execute on our business objective under various economic scenarios. ", "We are especially grateful for our clients, for their support and I am personally grateful to our customer sales and support teams around the world for their hard work. ", "And finally, with respect to our client-facing teams, earlier this week I announced a new streamlined management structure to achieve greater alignment between our sales, customer support, marketing, and product development functions. ", "By integrating these business units under a single leader, we expect to speed decision-making and increased responsiveness to clients and be better positioned to monitor strategic investment opportunities. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the detail of our financial results. ", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Thank you, Joe. As is now our custom, let me begin with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and then I will touch on trends we are seeing for the quarter ending in June, as well as some early results for July. ", "As Joe previously mentioned, it was a solid fiscal third quarter with strong revenue and earnings growth in line with our guidance in spite of higher-than-anticipated rebates and incentives. And of course, we benefited from the sale of our equity interest in Visa Net Brazil. ", "Total payment volume growth for Visa Inc. through the end of March 2009 in nominal dollars was a negative 5% over the same quarter in 2008. On a constant dollar basis, however, volume grew 2%. ", "In the U.S., payment volumes in the March ending quarter declined to a negative 3%, with debit delivering a solid 5% growth while credit growth was a negative 10%. Proportionately, debit payment volume continued to account for a greater percentage of total U.S. volume, although credit still remains the payment vehicle of choice in the rest of our regions. ", "On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the March ending quarter, moderating from the 14% growth exhibited in the December quarter but still solidly positive, a further recognition of the secular resiliency of plastic in many emerging and developing economies. ", "Cross-border volume growth first turned negative in the March ending quarter, posting a 6% decline on a constant dollar basis. Through the end of the June quarter, the rate of decline moderated and ended the period at a negative 8% growth rate. As in prior quarters, the slow down was broad-based. ", "Transactions processed over Visa's network, which are reported on a real-time basis, totaled $10.3 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 8% over the similar period a year ago and an increase from the 6% growth we saw in the previous quarter. Also, revenues from processed transactions, which currently generate approximately 30% of our gross revenue, continued to post solid growth as the underlying secular shift to Visa electronic payments continues. We also saw little variance in average ticket sizes, which are down 10% from the prior year period but on a sequential quarter basis appear to have leveled off. ", "Turning to the income statement, in the fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2 billion were up 5% from the similar periods in 2008. As Joe previously mentioned, volume and support incentives were elevated during the quarter due to the renewals of key customer contracts, several of which were accelerated due to bank consolidation. ", "All told, volume and support incentives increased on a year-over-year basis by $70 million to $344 million, representing 17% of gross revenue in the period and 15% of gross revenue year-to-date. ", "Given these results, we are updating our full-year expectation for volume and support incentives to be at the high-end of our 14% to 16% range. We will provide our outlook from 2010 in our fourth quarter earnings call.", "Net operating revenues were just over $1.6 billion, a 2% increase over the operating revenues reported for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 and in line with the revenue guidance we provided last quarter. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $769 million, up 3% over the prior year period and reflective of still moderating year-over-year payment volumes in all regions for the quarter ending March. ", "Data processing revenue, reported on a current basis, was $605 million, up 12% over the prior period as processed transactions continued to post solid growth in the quarter. ", "International transaction revenues, also reported on a current quarter basis, were up 2% to $458 million, as moderating cross-border volumes in the period were offset by some regional strategic pricing modifications. ", "Our adjusted operating margin was 51%, in line with our low 50s margin guidance for all of 2009. I\u2019ll provide additional color on our future margin expectations in a moment. ", "On an adjusted basis, operating expenses for the third quarter declined $79 million, or 9% year over year, driven by lower costs in personnel, marketing and professional fees. ", "Our focus on expense reduction continues to be broad-based and driven by merger related efficiencies. As expected, there was an up-tick in marketing spend in the quarter on a sequential basis, and we expect to see a similar step up in the fourth fiscal quarter. ", "Capital expenditures were $69 million in the quarter and included spend on our new data center, which will be completely online by the end of our fiscal year. With year-to-date capital expenditures running a little above $200 million, we now foresee full-year capital expenditures at around $300 million. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter in excellent shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash of $6.1 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express and Discover settlement. It also includes approximately $300 million that is current uncommitted, which was increased to just over $1 billion on the 16th of July in accordance with our previously announced litigation escrow funding event. ", "As we did last December, this funding was simply another way of buying back our stock while providing the added benefit of reducing the eventual B class overhang when the shares are ultimately unlocked. This latest repurchase will reduce our period end outstanding share count by 11.6 million shares for the fiscal fourth quarter ending this September. ", "On July 1st, we began the process of unlocking up to 30% of the outstanding Class B shareholdings, which will help alleviate some of the share overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011. Through this point in July, we have already had approximately 41% of the potentially available shares requested to be unlocked. ", "Now let me comment on the trends we are seeing that will impact our results in the final quarter of fiscal 2009. Specifically here in the U.S., payment volume growth improved slightly from a negative 3% growth rate in the March quarter to a negative 2% growth in the June ending quarter. Deconstructing this further, credit volume growth ended the period at a negative 10% while debit volume growth continued in positive territory, posting a 5% gain. ", "More recently, through the 26th of July, aggregate U.S. payment volume growth was a negative 3%. Credit growth continues at a negative 10% while debit growth is a positive 4% July month-to-date. ", "While we still see no signs of a true inflection point, these trends are encouraging. Furthermore, they are consistent with the performance we have seen over the past six months suggesting some level of stability. ", "Outside the U.S. for the quarter ending June 2009, we expect constant dollar payment volume growth rates to be solidly positive but to have declined modestly from their levels at the end of March. ", "As mentioned earlier, cross-border volumes in constant dollars were down a negative 6% in the March ending quarter and in the June quarter have declined to negative 8%. Month-to-date in July, the rate of decline has improved slightly to a negative 7%. More importantly, the velocity of the downturn has slowed, which is encouraging but it is still too early to call an inflection point. ", "Process transaction growth ended the June period at 8%, while month-to-date in July it has increased to 9%. This metric continues to be testament to the strength and resilience of debit as a greater percentage of process transactions are debit based. ", "Now let me comment on what we see over the coming quarter as far as our operating performance is concerned and how it affects our guidance. Based on our fiscal third quarter results and our improved fourth quarter outlook, we now believe fourth quarter revenue growth is more likely to be in the mid-single-digit range and we are confident in delivering net revenue growth in the high-single-digits for 2009. ", "And as Joe mentioned, this outlook encompasses a continued negative foreign exchange impact which on a year-over-year basis impacted revenue growth by about five percentage points in the third quarter and will likely be in the 4% to 5% range in the fourth quarter. ", "Given the strong adjusted operating margin exhibited this quarter, and our current outlook for 2010, we are adjusting up our 2010 guidance to the low 50% range from the prior range of high 40s to low 50s. Given the uncertain economy, it is always possible that we could see a quarter where the margin dips below 50% but on a fiscal year basis, we are comfortable with the low 50s. ", "Finally and most importantly, as Joe said, we remain on track to deliver 2009 adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 20%. And looking to fiscal 2010, we remain unchanged in our view that given a scenario that includes some recovery in the U.S. economy and in cross-border travel combined with more favorable comparisons in gas prices and foreign exchange rates, we would expect to exceed 20% earnings per share growth. ", "Of course, we are excluding the Visa Net Brazil gain in this calculation, which won\u2019t be replicated in 2010. ", "That concludes my comments so I will turn the call back over to Joe. ", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Thanks, Byron. Let me conclude with a review of some of the newer initiatives we are involved in. Earlier today we jointly announced with U.S. Bank the creation of a joint venture, Syncada, which will provide a global electronic business-to-business financial supply chain network. The joint venture expands our commercial product offerings and increases our participation in the B-to-B payment space as we continue to add services that deliver value to our financial institution clients around the world. ", "Also, at the end of June, we previously announced that we had entered into a strategic alliance and would be taking an equity stake in [Monetize], the United Kingdom based leader in the mobile financial services. This provides us with a development partner for our comprehensive suite of mobile services and highlights the fact that we are making the proper investments in technologies that we believe will be relevant to the future of electronic payments. ", "These types of strategic alliances and investments, coupled with the numerous partnerships, pilots, and commercialized programs that we are running around the globe today, will ensure that Visa and Visa Net remain the electronic payment system of choice for issuers, businesses, governments, and consumers the world over. ", "We also continue to make very nice headway in the prepaid space, not only here in the U.S. but in a number of regions globally. Prepaid, which is a natural extension of our already successful debit presence, is a business that we have been in for quite some time in the U.S. and in which we are seeing enormous opportunity internationally. ", "Domestically we currently run 66 different programs with 38 states for government disbursements. In the healthcare arena, seven of the top 10 insurance companies offer Visa spending account cards. ", "Other important categories in which we are active and have been quite successful include gift cards, general purpose reloadable cards, and payroll programs, to name a few. ", "In the U.S., we believe this is a $1 trillion potential market while globally it could be as high as $3 trillion.", "Stacked up against worldwide Visa payment volume for the 12 months through March of $2.7 trillion, it\u2019s easy to see that even a nominal penetration of this market could be needle moving for us. ", "The largest opportunity globally is penetrating the under-banked segment with general purposed reloadable cards. The under-banked includes both the under-served, those who don\u2019t have access to mainstream financial services, and those that choose for a wide variety of reasons alternative financial services. ", "In the U.S., about $80 million individuals fall into the under-banked category. Globally the under-banked may be a majority of consumers. Our success in debit in the U.S. should provide key advantages as we further penetrate the prepaid space. ", "Lastly, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already dominant presence on the Internet. While we have a commanding 48% payment volume share on the net, our ultimate goal is for an ever-increasing number of consumers to recognize that the fastest, safest, and easiest way to transact online is with a Visa branded product. ", "To that end, among other upgrades, we are on the cusp of rolling out an enhanced consumer platform that will ultimately assist Internet shoppers in three ways. First, pre-purchase activities like a best price search capability; second, check-out activities like aliasing and auto form fill; and third, post-purchase capabilities like tracking and shipping. ", "We\u2019ll have more to say about this in the coming months and look forward to updating you further on our next quarter\u2019s call. ", "With that, we are ready to take questions. Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Great results. Actually I was hoping to ask two questions, one business and one high level question. Just for some of the incentives, good news on the resignings. A couple of questions here -- any surprises here in terms of the demand that you are getting from the banks, you know, up-front payments or ongoing payments, et cetera? And then secondly, I know you are not going to give us guidance here until fiscal \u201910 but directionally, can we assume that we will see some relief in rebates in fiscal \u201910 in relation to fiscal \u201909, Byron, given the acceleration in the renewals?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I think that it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve achieved the objective that we set out to achieve. I think we\u2019ve done it well within the parameters of our expectations. I think that the transactions that we\u2019ve consummated have been good both for our clients and for ourselves. We said in the script that there was a somewhat elevated level of incentives this quarter as a result of that that we wouldn\u2019t expect to continue, so I think that everything that is going to happen in 2010 is pretty well embraced in the re-affirmation of our guidance that we made earlier in the call. ", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "And I would just add that the incentive levels going forward should be more a function of  the growth rates in the client portfolios, which are directly linked to the level of incentives we report. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, got it. I think it\u2019s a good outcome for sure. And Joe, I just wanted to ask, obviously a lot of focus out there on the regulatory risk, specifically around interchange and the possibility of some reductions there. I\u2019m not suggesting that anything is going to happen but I just wanted to ask, under a hypothetical scenario where interchange is regulated and let\u2019s say it\u2019s cut in a meaningful way, what kind of impact would that have on Visa? Specifically, would you expect your fees to indirectly come under some pressure as well? And also, what kind of impact could it have on volumes and the whole idea of the secular growth of card based payments, would there have -- would that have some influence on that as well? We obviously get that question quite a bit from investors. ", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, first of all I don\u2019t think that the situation that you describe is going to happen. We are confident that the legislators and the regulators understand that interchange is a pro-competitive structure, that it exists in every payment system around the globe and where there has been governmental intervention, that the consumer is the one that has suffered. ", "I think that it\u2019s also pretty obvious that merchants get, for a fairly reasonable cost, they get tremendous value. They get guaranteed payments, they get increased speed, they get better security, they get ticket lift -- just to name a few. And our discussions in Washington, D.C. suggest that the legislators now appreciate that there would probably be a significant negative unintended consequence from any congressional action on interchange. ", "That being said, there are actions that could occur in interchange which I do not believe would substantially affect us as it relates to our guidance or our notion of where Visa is going in the future. I suppose that if they eliminated interchange, which no one has ever even come close to suggesting in any scenario, that it would certainly create a reluctance by financial institutions to support electronic transactions to the extent that they do today. ", "But our biggest risk, to the extent that there is a risk, lies in the diminution of volume. I mean, if our volume were to go down, then obviously our revenues would go down. But once again, I don\u2019t think that this will happen. Secondly, you are talking about the United States and our volume is growing more outside of the United States than within the United States right now, so there\u2019s a whole number of factors that you would have to get your arms around and I think in the end, you\u2019d feel pretty good about Visa and Visa's prospects. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Very good. Thanks for that, Joe. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Harding with Barclays.", "Bruce Harding - Barclays Capital", "Is the -- do you still feel as strongly as you did in that previous quarter conference call about the dollar, the currency impact and the gas price impact and when you project the increase from this year to next year in terms of revenue growth, and you mentioned that this year you still expect to achieve high-single-digit despite 500 basis points of currency impact, is the key assumption that the currency impact goes away completely next year and you get a tailwind? ", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Let me respond to that -- we do have a good measurement of this impact and just to repeat, we feel that it was 500 basis points impact this quarter, this just completed quarter. We estimate 400 to 500 basis points. We hedge 17 currencies so -- and we have been hedging on a rolling basis throughout this past year, so we will -- we are confident that we will be able to bring a level of stability to our -- to FX rates in the coming year which, when compared to the rates that we\u2019ve experience this past year, give us a high degree of confidence that the headwind that we\u2019ve experienced this year will be substantially mitigated. ", "Second, with regard to gas prices, the June -- the month of June hit the high point in terms of average price per gas, for gallon of gas. We are starting by the first quarter, by November we should have -- actually in October and November, we are tracking to have a much more favorable compare with regard to gas prices and all the forecasts with regard to future gas pricing support that. ", "So with regard to our guidance going forward on those two factors, we\u2019re pretty comfortable. ", "Bruce Harding - Barclays Capital", "Thanks and Byron, the numbers you gave for July, you said that despite the fact that we are still well into negative territory, you feel encouraged. Is that because -- you say you are encouraged because unemployment keeps going higher and yet these numbers seem to be stabilizing despite that? And do you think the issuing banks have done most of the adjusting that they -- or you know, the process A to the weakening economy and higher unemployment and B, the legislation, do you think from what you\u2019ve seen in terms of looking at your slide on credit cards outstanding that -- you know, where are we in that process by the issuing banks of downsizing their credit card portfolios in favor of perhaps more debit?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Let me focus on the first part of your question -- what\u2019s giving us confidence, and the take here is that we have guided to low-single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. We have now moved that up to mid-single-digit guidance in the fourth quarter. What\u2019s giving us a little bit more bullish view -- first of all, as you\u2019ll recall, our service fees are booked on a one quarter lag basis and our service fees directly relate to payment volume that -- and in that regard, the payment volume for the June quarter is substantially [known], so 40% of our revenue for the fourth quarter related to service fees, is now highly estimable. What we have seen is that payment volume, the growth rate in payment volume in the U.S. dropped to minus 2, a little bit better than what we thought and the rest of world is holding up a bit better than what we had forecasted. That\u2019s service fees. On cross border, what we have noticed is that not knowing what the trajectory was going to be, we made certain assumptions. The June quarter, ending quarter went to minus 8. We had originally forecasted something that was a bit lower than that and what we are seeing in July, with the month of July nearly complete, we are at minus 7, so a bit better. ", "And then turning to transactions, if you look at the trajectory, in quarter two we had 6% transaction growth. In quarter three, June ending quarter, we had plus 8 with July just about in the record books, we\u2019re at plus 9. ", "So when you put those three perspectives together, that\u2019s really the impetus for our change in view and why we\u2019ve moved it from low-single-digits up to mid-single-digits. ", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Yeah, the only thing I would add to that is to continue to remember that a lot of our transactional increases were being driven by our debit volume, not our credit volume. The credit volume is already off substantially and none of our projections suggest that it is going to come back, come roaring back in any way, shape, or form. And then finally, we keep reminding everyone that our international transactions, our international credit volume is growing. ", "Bruce Harding - Barclays Capital", "Thank you. Byron, were you going to comment on that other, about the issuing banks or that\u2019s it?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "That\u2019s it. ", "Bruce Harding - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of David Hochstem with Buckingham Research.", "David Hochstem - Buckingham Research", "Joe, could you just provide a little more color on the operational organizational changes that you announced this week and what benefits you expect to realize in terms of product rollout and interaction with customers, and what Mr. Morris will be doing?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "So let me start off -- to answer the first part of your question, we are putting the product development function in with the marketing and sales and I think it will make the organization more effective, and I think that Hans would definitely agree with that. ", "As it relates to Hans, Hans has made a substantial contribution to this organization. I mean, it\u2019s really something else when you think about where we started out and where we are now and his contributions to the IPO, his contributions to our relationship with Visa Europe, his contributions to organizing our international organization. And so I would say that as time went on, his notion of a succession or how that might go changed somewhat and that led to conversations about the organization that we just talked about, that he was fully supportive of and so I think that we both decided that he\u2019d be best served -- or he decided that he\u2019d be best served by pursuing some other opportunities, and so I\u2019m a huge supporter of his and I\u2019m sure that he will be quite successful. He is on our payroll until December. He is contributing on a daily basis and he is sitting right here and I see him shaking his head and I don\u2019t see anything -- ", "Unidentified Participant", "", "Nodding my head. ", "Joseph W. Saunders", "He\u2019s nodding his head, so I would say that that\u2019s what the answer is. ", "David Hochstem - Buckingham Research", "Okay, and in terms of just operations -- I mean, does this speed time to market for new products or --", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, look, I mean, we have a commitment to our investors that we are going to keep refining our model and be -- and that we are going to continually become a better company, that we are going to become quicker to market, we are going to be a little bit more decisive, we are going to be very introspective about what we invest in and what we don\u2019t invest in. We are going to be looking to the future to make sure that we do things appropriately and that we don\u2019t get the rug pulled out from under us two or three years from now. ", "And so I think -- we\u2019re talking about part of the process here. I mean, this isn\u2019t a revolution, it\u2019s part of an evolution and so far I think it\u2019s gone quite well and I would expect it to continue. ", "David Hochstem - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs ", "Great, thanks. Byron, just one point of clarification -- is the guidance for fiscal fourth quarter, is that a gross number or net number for revenues? ", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Net revenue gross, mid-single-digits. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs ", "Got it, and then 400 to 500 basis points of drag, correct? Of currency drag?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Correct. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs ", "Got it. And then just in terms of marketing initiatives and spend, looking to the World Cup next year, how do we think about how quickly that has to ramp up in terms of spending, or is that spending behind you? Just as a major initiative next year, how will that ramp through your advertising and marketing numbers?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "So to be helpful on this, what we\u2019ve said in our opening remarks is that there is a -- there was a bit of a marketing lift in this quarter, a bit of a marketing lift expected in the fourth quarter. But no call out relative to World Cup because we are lapping an Olympic year and there are natural trade-outs that we make and substitutions as we have premiere events to marquee. And so no call out on World Cup and you\u2019ve got some guidance to finish up the year in marketing. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs ", "Okay, got it. And then lastly, if I try to sort of bridge the gap between the volume assumptions that you\u2019ve already shared with us, the currency, any way to get a sense on what the implied pricing would be, either on the cross border side or on the other side of your business, card services or data processing fees?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "I think what we\u2019ve said is we are in the later stages of the more step function type pricing adjustment and that this will be a more modest contributor going forward, that we\u2019ll grow this business the old fashioned way, which is through payment volume and transaction growth. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs ", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Calyon Securities.", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Good evening. One question about Visa Europe -- we\u2019re hearing through our contacts in Europe that Visa Europe is really playing up the independence card, you know, we are owned by European banks for European banks, so we\u2019re not associated with the big bad U.S. company, so you should sign with us and oh, by the way, we\u2019ll pay for your conversions. But the European banks are a little concerned that there is the option to sell themselves back to Visa Inc. and that that might be coming quickly if they do a conversion, so I was just wondering if there\u2019s any additional conversations with Visa Europe regarding them becoming part of Visa Inc. ", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Most of the time when I think about them exercising the put, I think about it because somebody asks me about it, but other than that I don\u2019t think about it much. ", "There is nothing in the relationship between ourselves and Visa Europe that would suggest that they are about ready to exercise the put, or even thinking about it. I think that we are running the company as Visa Inc., which is what we\u2019ve always intended to, and that\u2019s about as far as I can go right now. ", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Okay. If I can just follow-up -- have you seen any traction in your money transfer initiatives, as I know the network is capable now of processing money transfers on any Visa card to any terminal?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "We\u2019ll be talking a lot more about that when we get into our next quarter call and some of our guidance for the future. I mentioned the prepaid cards which fit into the whole notion of money transfer in a big way. It\u2019s part of our plans. I am sure you\u2019ve seen that we have associated ourselves with Moneygram and Western Union and so there are the beginnings of looking at this very carefully and deciding where we want to go. But I\u2019m just not ready to talk about it publicly. ", "Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Okay. Thanks, Joe. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.", "Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I just have a couple of quick questions, the first of which is as you think about growth in some of the emerging markets where you maybe don\u2019t have as large a market presence and notoriety, have you considered acquiring processors or joint ventures with processors in those markets, and would you be open to that?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, yes. ", "Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Should we expect something in the next couple of quarters?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "We\u2019ve talked about it and we\u2019ve thought about it and we\u2019ve looked at it. ", "Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And it\u2019s something that you would be positively disposed to doing?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t think about it and look at it and talk about it if I wasn\u2019t somewhat disposed to doing it. ", "Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Let me ask you another question -- do you think you\u2019ve got to have global consumer credit expansion in order to continue to drive growth there, given it\u2019s such a credit focused rest of world? Or can you continue to kind of penetrate debit in those markets using some of your tricks from the U.S.?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I think it is our intention to penetrate markets with the debit product. I also think it\u2019s important though to make sure that everybody understands that the credit market outside the United States is not exactly the same as the credit market in the United States. And in fact, there are many credit products outside the United States that are probably -- that probably have more similarity to a debit product than you might expect. So it\u2019s a little bit different. ", "But I think we are well-positioned along the entire spectrum, all the way from preloaded cards to premium credit cards as it relates to product offerings and our willingness and ability to start penetrating other markets -- ", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "And I would just add to that that with regard to credit outside the United States, that we did have a solid growth rate for the March ending quarter and we expect to have positive growth in credit outside the United States all on a constant dollar basis in the quarter ending in June as well. ", "Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And then just lastly and then I\u2019ll be done -- on the incentive fees, around the time of the IPO you had always said that that was a number that actually should trend up because it was primarily a U.S. phenomenon and using that to get contracts and as you went internationally, you were going to start to use is. ", "But what I\u2019m hearing from you guys today is that that is abating a bit, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a change of tone to using incentive fees as you go abroad?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "As we put more clients under multi-year contracts, which is a strategy that we support, with contracts comes an agreement to offer incentive, and so it is a continuing strategy of ours over time to have more clients under multi-year contract and therefore there would be more client revenue that would be subject to incentives. That strategy was articulated at the time of the IPO and it is still a strategy that we are pursuing today. ", "Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with UBS Securities.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Thanks. I wanted to start with a clarification on the quarter itself -- the $0.67 pro forma EPS number, what tax rate was behind that? Was that a normalized tax rate or -- I think the GAAP tax rate was more in the 43%-ish range related to the gain on sale. Can you clarify that?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Yes, the $0.67 was at a more normalized tax rate because the boost in our tax rate for the quarter was due to the Visa Net Brazil transaction because of some capital gains taxes and the tax environment specific to Brazil, we ended up experiencing about 4 percentage points higher tax rate in the quarter. When you back that out -- so to go from $0.98 on an adjusted basis down to $0.67, when you remove that transaction, you would then go to the more normalized tax rate, which was trending at about 39.5. ", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Okay, and that was the basis for the $0.67?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Yes. ", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just to pick up on an earlier question as far as confidence and visibility on the low-end of the 11% to 15% net revenue growth range for next year, you talked about the currency and gas components of that. Obviously the two other underlying assumptions you\u2019ve discussed for a while are the broader U.S. economy and cross-border. It seems like those numbers are kind of stable, bouncing around a little bit. Can you just talk about your relative level of comfort with those two variables and how important they might be versus the other two variables in terms of actually getting yourself into this 11% to 12% range or so for next year?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I think the specific words that I used in the script were we would start to see some movement, so we don\u2019t expect any significant positive movement in either of the economy or cross border transactions, although we do expect them to stabilize and start to move up very modestly.", "And as long as that happens in the first quarter, early second quarter, I\u2019m quite confident we will get to where we are going. ", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Okay, so we don\u2019t really need to see this \u201cpositive inflection point\u201d anytime real soon to still get you into this range, it sounds like?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "No, it doesn\u2019t have to happen [inaudible]. ", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Kissane with Banc of America.", "James Kissane - Banc of America Securities", "Great, thanks. Byron, what portion of the incentives in the quarter were more one-time and what portion is recurring? And maybe on a more normal basis, what portion will be one-time and what portion is recurring?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "Jim, as you can appreciate, we don\u2019t discuss that level of granularity on the incentive. We\u2019ve tried to be helpful here by saying it was somewhat elevated given the unusual high level of contract activity that was successfully completed in the quarter and we will look forward to giving more guidance around the incentive levels when we finish up the fourth quarter and we give you an outlook for -- a more informed outlook for fiscal year \u201910. ", "James Kissane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Any change in the average term of the contracts on the renewals?", "Byron H. Pollitt Jr.", "I would say at the time of the IPO, I would say the most difficult contract length was five years. I would say we are starting to see some increasing interest going a bit beyond five. To say that it\u2019s actually moved the average might be too strong a term but we are seeing some contracts now that -- substantive contracts that are going beyond five years. ", "James Kissane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks, Byron. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi, Wells Fargo.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering, a question about U.S. debit -- if I look at the last six to seven quarters, sort of boiling it down to the spend and transactions per card, you know, I think the conventional wisdom would have been that as the economy suffered, people would switch spending habits from credit to debit and looking at sort of year-over-year growth in transactions per card, even dollars per card spent, it doesn\u2019t look like that has occurred. ", "So I\u2019m wondering if there is something regarding inactive or just newer debit cards on the U.S. platform that have not quite matured in terms of the user getting more comfortable with them, and as well if you could talk about any kind of strategies or discussions with your banking partners in the U.S. about trying to drive higher utilization on debit in the face of what you\u2019ve articulated about credit, that it\u2019s essentially probably going nowhere in the U.S. ", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Wow, that\u2019s a loaded question. Let me start with the back-end of that. First of all, we are working to drive debit [both with our clients and that is the entire basis of our media campaign in the United States this year]. I mean, everything that we are doing in the media is debit centric and is predicated on using debit cards. ", "I would say that you are going to see debit cards be a very, very good story going forward. I think you will see the number of transactions that people use their cards for going up. I think that we continue to see more cards being put into the market and all the right things are happening on the debit front. ", "And I want to say one other thing -- I didn\u2019t say the credit card market in the United States was [inaudible]. I didn\u2019t say that. I said that we were not anticipating that we were going to get much velocity from the credit card market in the next 12 months. I think that as a result of the Credit Card Act and some of the issues that financial institutions have with the loan quality of their portfolio, that it would just be na\u00efve to think that there wouldn\u2019t be some reflection as it related to that product and how it was going to be issued and how it was going to be used, but I certainly don\u2019t believe, and unless any of my clients are telling me differently, that the credit card is dead. ", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "Okay, and I appreciate that. Just to follow-up on that debit question then, do you think it\u2019s a matter of just more consumer awareness or are there key verticals and other areas of spend in the U.S. where there just needs to be more merchant acceptance to get that spend up on debit, or is this really just more and more advertising and the banks getting to those consumers more effectively that use this card as much as you can?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I guess I would have to look at the exact number you are looking at because when I look at the numbers, the transaction -- our transaction volume is up 9% in the last quarter. It is mostly coming from the debit sector. ", "We have three times as many debit transactions as credit card transactions and have for a little while now, and for the first time in the history of Visa, last quarter the dollar volume of debit card transactions exceeded that of credit card transactions. ", "So my view into this product is a pretty positive view and I expect that to continue. I think you might want to pick this question up with Jack Carsky because I am just -- you kind of caught me a little bit off-balance here because I\u2019m not sure we are talking the same language. ", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "Okay. I appreciate that, we\u2019ll do that, thanks. ", "Jack Carsky", "At this point, we have time for one more question. ", "Operator", "The last question comes from Donald Fendetti with Citigroup.", "Donald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup", "Clearly the U.S. seems to have stabilized in terms of credit but it looks like the international growth rates are still positive but moderating. I was just curious sort of what your view is on the insight on the non-U.S. consumer -- are we pretty close to where you think those growth rates will start stabilizing?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, that\u2019s a little bit difficult to call. The fact of the matter is there have been issues, economic issues all over the world and the fact that the international credit card volume is growing has as much to do with the secular shift from cash and checks to plastic as it does with a consumer\u2019s use of credit as you might think about it in the United States. ", "So I think that this has a while. I think that this has a while to play out and I think that we are continuing to get traction in different parts of the world and I think that -- you know, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to stop so I think we\u2019ll have a pretty positive story as time goes on. And I guess the best I can do is -- to end all of this is to tell you that we are cautiously optimistic that things are getting somewhat better, not somewhat worse. ", "Donald Fendetti \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thanks. ", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to either call myself or Victoria.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. And again our sincerest apologies for what was pretty large technical difficulty. Today with us are Joe Saunders, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com.", "A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.

Additional information concerning those factors is available in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC which can be accessed through the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of the Visa website.", "For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available on the financial and statistical summary accompanying our fiscal first quarter earnings press release. This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe.", "Joe Saunders", "Thank you, Jack. As we begin our new fiscal year, I am pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically and internationally.", "With that being said, and consistent with our guidance expectations, it remains difficult to foresee how global economies will perform in the coming year, so we maintain cautious optimism about Visa\u2019s results over the balance of 2010. Earnings for our first fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $1.02 per diluted share, a $0.28 or 38% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $763 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period.", "Recall that we will no longer be providing an adjusted basis for these metrics, but will adhere to the GAAP reported numbers going forward. Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 13% increase over the year-ago period and in line with our guidance as a result of solid payment volume and cross border volume growth as well as strong process transaction growth.", "For the first time in our quarterly reporting, we are providing global payment volume growth in our operational performance data pack for the quarter just ended. These results which will still be recognized on a lag basis and reflected in fiscal second quarter service revenue show encouraging improvement over the fiscal first quarter. ", "Process transactions continue to grow from the mid to high single digit levels we saw over the course of fiscal 2009, ending the first quarter at 10.9 billion transactions, a 12% growth rate over the prior year period and up 9% from the growth reported for the fiscal fourth quarter.", "I am pleased that we are executing well against our business plan. As we expand our payments network, growing issuers and acceptance locations, expanding our processing capabilities and driving transactions with effective marketing programs, we are able to take full advantage of the secular trend to digital currency and grow our business. As a result even in this difficult economic environment, we are generating solid earnings and returning excess cash flow to our shareholders.", "During the first quarter, we repurchased $432 million of our class A shares under our previously announced $1 billion buyback plan at an average price of just under $79 a share. We will continue to execute on this buyback as conditions warrant.", "We also recently announced the unlocking of an additional 56 million shares of our class C stock which will allow class C shareholders, primarily our international financial institution owners the ability to further monetize their Visa investment ahead of the scheduled March 2011 unlock. This program has no dilutive effect on our earnings per share and is similar to the prior program we executed in July of last year.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the details of our financial results and then I will be back to share our views on the economic environment and our upcoming March Investor Day.", "Byron Pollitt", "", "Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me began with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.", "As Joe already mentioned, it was a solid quarter with slightly higher than anticipated revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As noted earlier, we began providing realtime payment volume statistics this quarter. However, it is important to keep in mind that for the time being, we will continue to recognize current quarter service revenues on prior quarter payment volume.", "While it is our ultimate intent to recognize the associated revenue on a current basis as well, that's still in the future. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 2% in the June quarter to 3%. In the US payment volume growth was a negative 1% in the September quarter, up from a negative 3% in the June quarter.", "Debit again proved both its resiliency as a product, and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 7% growth compared to 5% growth in the June quarter. Credit, while still challenged, improved to a negative 9% in the September period from a negative 10% in the June period. On a constant dollar basis, rest of the world payment volume grew at 8% in the September quarter holding steady with the 8% rate delivered in the June quarter.", "These results reflect continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US. Global crossborder volume growth improved in the September quarter, posting a negative 5% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 8% rate in the June period. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $10.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 12% over the similar period a year ago and up from 9% we saw in the September quarter.", "Turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year\u2019s depressed level of 13% and more indicative of what we can expect over the course of fiscal 2010 as payment volume growth improved versus the prior year.", "Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. This was in line with our revenue guidance, though slightly ahead of the low end of an 11% to 15% range provided to you last quarter. The drivers were better than anticipated process transaction growth and crossborder volume as well as the continuing effect of previously disclosed pricing actions.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items for the quarter service revenue was $827 million, up 4% over the prior-year period and reflective of still relatively anemic payment volume growth in the quarter ending September. Data processing revenue was $765 million, up 38% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 12% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.", "International transaction revenues were up a solid 9% to $552 million primarily due to an improvement in crossborder volumes during the period.", "The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the fiscal first quarter was neutral due to the impact of our hedging activity. At this point in the fiscal calendar, the balance of year revenue forecast is substantially hedged. ", "Our operating margin was 62%, but benefited from a one-time reversal of $41 million in litigation reserves and from favorable timing in marketing spend. The $41 million contra-expense in the quarter is related to the previously announced pre-payment of the retailer's litigation settlement which by itself represents two full percentage points of margin and contributed a non-recurring $0.03 to the quarter's earnings per share.", "Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $743 million, a decline of $30 million or 4% year-over-year. These results benefited from the gain related to the retailer's litigation settlement mentioned earlier and $28 million in restructuring costs incurred in the prior year.", "Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis. On a sequential quarter basis, we saw lower expenses in several line items including personnel, marketing and professional fees. The lower personnel spend was primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and incentive accruals in the current quarter.", "This quarter, we also reclassified certain contractor expenses to the personnel line that heretofore were characterized under professional and consulting fees. This reclassification was applied to each of the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the full year 2008. We have included a pro forma reconciliation of this with our press release financials to assist you in your modeling efforts.", "Marketing costs were sequentially lower. For context, we intentionally curtailed some media spend in the first quarter while absorbing Winter Olympics reduction expenses in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter. Media spend will increase in the second and third quarters around the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup event, both of which are major Visa sponsorships. Even with these investments aimed at activating our global sponsorships, we continue to see full year marketing expense below $1 billion.", "Professional and consulting fees declined sequentially as a result of higher spending in the prior quarter, as we brought our new East Coast Data Center fully online. ", "Capital expenditures were $37 million in the quarter representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter in strong shape with negligible debt, and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale investments of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully payout the American Express settlement with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.", "As we previously announced in a press release two weeks ago and as Joe mentioned earlier, we will be unlocking 50% of the remaining outstanding Class C shareholders representing 56 million shares which will further alleviate the Class C overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011.", "Now let me comment on December\u2019s payment volume data and our early read on January. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in September to 8%. We experienced meaningful growth in all of our global regions.", "In the US, payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. Debit continued to prove its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Debit currently accounts for 54% of total US payment volumes. Credit, while still challenged, rebounded to a negative 1% in the December period from a negative 9% rate in the September period.", "Looking to January, through the 28th of the month, US payment volume growth up 10% is above the fiscal fourth quarter rate of 7% and on par with December\u2019s month end 10% growth. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, up from an 8% rate in the September quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US.", "Global cross border volume growth rebounded considerably in the December quarter posting a 2% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 5% rate in the September period. Growth in the month of December was an unexpectedly strong 4%. ", "Whether it is representative of a broader cyclical trend or just pent-up demand remains to be determined. Having said that, January crossborder volume growth on a constant basis showed further resiliency posting a 9% rate of growth through the 28th of the month, up from the 4% rate for the month of December. Process transactions through the 28th of January grew 13% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 12% growth posted for the fiscal first quarter.", "Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our full year guidance. Based on an encouraging first quarter, we are recasting our net revenue growth target for the year to be in the range of 11% to 15% rather than at the low end of that range. Holding to our target range recognizes that our fiscal year is just underway and global economic performance is still difficult to foresee.", "We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis excluding the VisaNet Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal, better than 20%.", "We are raising our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin to the mid to high 50s, up slightly from the mid 50s, we initially targeted for this year. As mentioned earlier, increased marketing and advertising expenses in the next two quarters, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives will exert a downward bias on our margin for the balance of the year.", "Based on a better understanding of our tax outlook, we now expect our full year 2010 tax rate to be in a range of 36.5% to 38.5% rather than the 38% to 39% range with which we began the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be around $200 million at the low end of our initial range of $200 million to $250 million. And our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million pre-payment we made in the quarter on the previously settled retailer's litigation.", "That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe.", "Joe Saunders", "Thanks Bryon. At this point, I'm sure you're sensing an underlying theme of appropriate cautiousness in our comment, and you should. While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic picture, it's difficult to predict when a sustained recovery will be underway.", "As the ongoing secular shift to electronic payments continues, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising activities are squarely aimed at positively influencing that shift to Visa products.", "We saw a strong growth in debit with positive comparables in certain categories of spend like fuel and recurring bill pay adding to that growth. We saw a better than anticipated international and crossborder volumes, but we're not clear if those are improving volumes representing a rebound or simply pent-up demand as Byron mentioned.", "We believe that any recovery will take time and will likely have a few bumps along the way. A complete turnaround in the US will arguably take even longer. Things like continuing high unemployment and underemployment, high levels of consumer debt and restrained consumer confidence will keep a lid on overall spending and payments growth especially credit for the foreseeable future.", "So, at this point in time we are continuing to focus on the initiatives that allowed us to get through this recession up to now in good shape. Focusing on cost efficiencies and making the right investments for the future will allow us to fully take advantage of our business models as economies around the world gain ground. More importantly, it will set the stage for success over the longer term, as the payments industry continues to evolve globally.", "At our upcoming Investor Day in March we will be providing you with greater insights into our long-term growth strategy. Specifically we'll explore the six key elements to this strategy including our local market focus, products and services, processing, brand, clients and acceptance. And we\u2019ll discuss how the investment decisions we are making today will help us achieve our longer-term growth objectives.", "As part of Investor Day, various members of our management team will present on their respective areas of expertise to illustrate how the elements of our strategy tie together.", "We're looking forward to engaging in this strategic discussion with you, and of course we welcome your input on the agenda for the Investor Day and encourage you to reach out to our Investor Relations team on any specific areas of interest or concern you\u2019d like to see covered.", "With that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Adam Frisch for Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "", "Professional and consulting expense, Byron, you explained why it was a little bit lower year-over-year, but it\u2019s actually the one line item we'd like to see increased a lot, given that\u2019s where the bulk of the product and R&D spend is. So, what is the trend there in terms of the investment in product and R&D and would you consider breaking out those investments in a separate line item going forward, so investors can get a better feel for resource allocation?", "Byron Pollitt", "", "Once we normalize out the professional consulting expense associated with getting the new data center open which is now fully operational and live, we should be managing that up as we continue to invest in expanding our infrastructure and capabilities as well as new product investments. With regard to breaking that out to give more visibility to the type of expense that\u2019s going against future growth, great question, we have that under consideration and we'll seriously consider that perhaps later in the year.", "Joe Saunders", "", "You should remember that that line item includes all of our legal expenses for litigation and we had a lot of that last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "A quick question and a clarification if I could. My question is just to what extent are you seeing issuers reengage and start promoting credit products more actively at all and how much of that activity might be directed towards the affluent end of the market. We're also hearing more about increased mailings occurring over the last two months of '09 and then my clarification is can you give a split on your US payment volumes for January between credit and debit within that plus 10%?", "Joe Saunders", "I think that there is considerable interest in the higher end of the retail market. I don\u2019t think there is any question about that, and there is some evidence that there is a little bit more activity on the solicitation front, but I would say it's a way too early to say things have turned around and we're back to something that's close to what we were maybe a year and a half or two years ago.", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me give you a little color on US debit and credit, and give you a little bit of historical trending by month and then into January, so you can see the progress. If we were to go back to October, credit grew in the US at minus four, November minus two, and then December actually turned positive two, January month to date through the 28th positive one. ", "If we were to do the same chronology for debit, October debit payment volume growth for the US was positive 12, moved to positive 15 in November, positive 19 in December and it's holding it positive 19 January month to date. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs ", "Can you just characterize a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of the impact of the CARD Act, and what that might be doing relative to your pricing strategies or anything that you guys might be feeling as a result of the legislation at this point?", "Joe Saunders ", "", "I think as we\u2019ve said before, the CARD Act has an indirect effect on us, but not a direct effect. You are asking a question that is difficult for me to answer. I think it would more appropriately answered by our financial institution customers.", "Having said that, Byron just went over the gross statistics on the credit card business compared to the debit card business and I think it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not growing at anything close to the rates that it historically has and obviously a lot of that has to do with the economy and a lot of that has to do with the rules and regulations that they operate in.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Craig Maurer at CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "You had mentioned the growth in recurring bill pay, I was wondering if you\u2019ve had any progress in terms of getting utilities to sign on for that product?", "Joe Saunders", "I think we\u2019ve had a pretty consistent growth in that category over the last several years, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what percent of that category it is, it\u2019s something that you might want to follow up with Jack.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW", "Byron, I was wondering if you could just quantify kind of the seasonality of the marketing spend this year in terms of magnitude and just the tax rate, should we assume that we build off of that in terms of migrating lower in 2011?", "Byron Pollitt", "On the marketing side, the way we try to be helpful here is that the first quarter is low spending for the year. We will increase marketing spend in the second fiscal quarter, think of that as Winter Olympics driven. Then third quarter, we will be increasing marketing spend relative to the first quarter, think of that as FIFA World Cup. So the marketing spend which is under $1 billion, with the guidance for the year is much more oriented to the middle two fiscal quarters, with the first quarter probably being the lightest.", "If you switch to the tax rate, so we have re-guided the tax rate into a range of 36.5 to 38.5. That follows the trajectory that we outlined during our IPO presentation of ultimately aiming to be in the 35% to 36% range, so we consider that a journey. We have yet to process what the administration\u2019s recent tax proposals are and of course that guidance was not enlightened by those tax proposals.", "So I would say stay tuned on what 2011, 2012 and beyond will ultimately yield, but we remain on this trajectory of getting into that 35% to 36% range that we talked about from inception.", "Operator", "", "Next question comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford Bernstein", "You just posted 13% revenue growth, a very strong volume growth and also improving revenue yield and we are at the beginning of what seems to be an upturn in the economy and so your current revenue growth run rate is at the midpoint of your new revenue growth guidance.", "I was wondering if you could just handicap or sort of talk to us about what would have to happen for your revenue growth to come in at the low end of your revenue range? Then what would have to happen to be at the high-end or even at above the upper end of your range because it seems if the cyclical trends continue just to run on their current page, you might actually be able to exceed your latest revenue guidance range or maybe I'm looking at that the wrong way, so I wonder if you could handicap that for us?", "Joe Saunders", "I think that we said on a number of occasions that we're comfortable with our guidance, and we are maintaining cautious optimism. We think that we did better in the first quarter than we thought we were going to do. We don't know whether that level of activity is sustainable and I'm a little bit conservative in that. I'm not ready to predict where the economy is going and so it's hard for me to answer that question.", "What I can answer is given the environment that we're operating in today, we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Bruce Harting from Barclays Capital.", "Bruce Harting - Barclays Capital", "Can you just compare and contrast the credit trends in US versus rest of the world in terms of the growth rates you're seeing and then to the degree that you can give any kind of outlook to next 2011 on the expense line?", "Ordinarily companies with the kind of growth you're having are matching that up with some kind of expense growth, but you're able to hold the line on expense in marketing this year and still as the last question alluded to give the appearance at least through the first quarter that you're well ahead of your targets, so if you could just comment on those?", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me start with the credit trends. So using rest of world as the proxy, for what you are asking about, the rest of world, considered on a constant dollar basis, the growth trends in credit, credit alone, so this would exclude debit, credit alone never turned negative. It did drop from a high double-digits growth into mid single-digit growth, that\u2019s what we are looking at for the quarter just ended in December and on a slight upward trend for rest of world. We are still in that mid to upper single-digit credit growth. If you look at all products, credit plus debit, then you are right around 10% growth for the quarter just ended, and that would be the quarter just ended in December.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan", "I wanted to ask about debit which accelerated more than we expected both in the US and overseas. A couple of questions there, was there anything unusual to consider like new wins cycling through, just trying to get a better sense of same-store growth? And secondly I was curious if you\u2019re seeing any signs of debit cannibalizing credit?", "Joe Saunders", "Well, I don\u2019t how you define whether debit cannibalizes credit, obviously debit is growing quickly than credit, but I think that\u2019s the nature of the economic environment that we are living in. I think that the question is to what extent will the credit volume accelerate as the economy improves and I think till that happens it\u2019s going to hard to measure the balance between the two of them.", "I mean we obviously remain very encouraged about our debit growth, but we are frankly also encouraged with what's going on with the credit product in the world outside of United States, particularly, but we are not particularly discouraged by what's going on in the US. Was there another part of the question, I think I am missing part of the question. Did I answer your question? Okay. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital", "I was wondering if you could just give us some sort of update as it pertains to kind of the enhanced check out services you guys have been talking about in the past and then the other EC initiatives, e-commerce initiatives that you have been spending a fair bit of money on? Thanks.", "Joe Saunders", "", "Well, I think the enhance checkout is something that we are pretty excited about and we intend to roll that out in a very big way in about six weeks. So, I think I'll leave that until our Investor Day presentation. But I will tease you by telling you we are extremely excited about it, I think it'll be a big deal. And we continue to invest in that and other electronic payment improvements, whether they are in the Internet space or the mobile space or anyone of a number of other things.", "Byron mentioned that probably beginning at our March Investor Day we will breakout what we are spending on what a little bit more clearly than we have up to now, but I will remind you that we have committed to spending a $150 million to $200 million on new product development this year and I think that we will get there. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Kissane from Banc of America.", "Jim Kissane - Banc of America", "Thanks. Joe, can you comment on the competitive environment, and your recent loss of a large debit portfolio? Thanks. And maybe just to follow-up, an update on the conversion of the WaMu portfolio and the timing of the SunTrust roll off?", "Joe Saunders", "I think that we've said for a long time on a lot of these calls, that you should expect it sooner or later we are going to lose a customer and that's exactly what happened. We like to believe that we are disciplined as it relates to what we are willing to do, and how far we are willing to go, and I think that this is a case in point, so I'm unhappy that we lost a customer. ", "We don't lose very many, we've gained a lot more than we've lost. But that being said, it's a tough competitive environment and as I have also said on a number of occasions, MasterCard is a good company. And they are just consistently getting beat [ph] on every deal that there is.", "As it relates to the WaMu portfolio, I think we are just beginning to see any -- we're only at the very early stages of beginning to see any volume. The conversion is going on, I think it's pretty de minimis in the numbers that you are looking after this quarter, particularly since the service revenues are lagged. ", "I would say as it relates to SunTrust that I don't know what their conversion schedule is, but I believe that will take a reasonable amount of time to fully divest themselves.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from Janney.", "Tom McCrohan - Janney", "Joe, can you prioritize kind of your strategic initiatives beyond this year as far as how are you going to generate long term revenue growth outside of just the secular shift from cash and check to electronic payments, one of those initiatives obviously being trying to position Visa as best possible for growth outside the United States. I am just kind of wondering how you are thinking about that, because given it seems like everyone just keeps talking about the secular shift, secular shift, that\u2019s going to slow at some point and it seems like there is a lot more powerful trends outside the US, just want to see how you are thinking about that? Thanks.", "Joe Saunders", "But we can ride the secular shift I think for quite a while if we did it appropriately, but you are right. I mean there is a lot more to it than that, I don\u2019t think that I could even begin to answer the question and do a justice in the amount of time that we have. But once again I will encourage you and everybody else to attend our investor conference, because I do intend and we do intend to expand a great deal on the subject and it\u2019s worth listening to and it'll take a little time, but I can assure you, if you come, the trip will be worthwhile.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Parker from Lazard.", "David Parker - Lazard", "I was just hoping you could update us on the Canadian market, and specifically the finance ministry up there has established some current voluntary code of contact that you and others have responded to, but is that any sense for the outcome of that and has that changed your strategy or your timing for entering that market more aggressively.", "Joe Saunders", "", "I think that we are in a period of reflection right now and I don\u2019t think it will move quite as aggressively as we might have hoped. But having said that, these rules in general are quite acceptable to us, and I think that the one or two sticking points that will be resolved, and I think that we will proceed into the market, but I can't give you specifics or specific timing as it relates to that. I guess, I'll just have to leave you with the thought that we're still sure that we will be in the debit market in Canada at sometime in the not terribly distant future.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo.", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "", "A question around debit, two parts, number one, were there any portfolio conversions in 1Q that helped to drive such strong growth and cards issued, it looks like it probably was? And second, just within the debit business and the strong growth in what appears to be accelerating growth, are there any strategic or product driven initiatives within Visa or the large issuers that you are aware of that could be setting the stage for more than just a cyclical rebound, but maybe a lot more life in debit market than maybe was previously thought.", "Joe Saunders", "", "Well, okay, to answer the first part of the question, we've looked at this quite carefully and there is no effect of adding other portfolios in our numbers in this quarter. The growth is real growth not growth because we added a customer. To answer the second part of your question, it seems to me that when I look at retail services and financial institutions that there is a more holistic customer experience type of movement that\u2019s going on. I think, it\u2019s a share of wallet movement, I think it is an effort by financial institutions to embrace individual customers over a wide array of products and making sure that these things complement each other. ", "So, I think you'll see things begin to happen that are a little bit different and I believe that you'll see some focus on encouraging transactions and encouraging consolidation within a financial institution. But, I am not a financial institution and I cannot speak for them, and there is a lot going on in every major financial institution, every medium sized and small financial institution in this country as a result of economy that we find ourselves in, rules and regulations that they look like. So, I would encourage you to continue to ask them the same questions and see what they say. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Roger Smith from Macquarie.", "Roger Smith - Macquarie", "", "I just know that there is a number of licensing fees in the other line and I was just wondering is there something unique going on there in that quarter? And then the second part I guess is that, you did give us the trends in the US, but was there anything specific that happened in those businesses that did cause you to increase your guidance, I mean relative to what you guys had been expecting, what's changing? ", "Joe Saunders", "", "I think that there is a little bit more pickup than we anticipated. There is clearly more pickup in the cross border volume than what we had anticipated. So, we're pleasantly surprised in that regard as it relates to your first quarter. ", "Byron Pollitt", "", "Yes, you're referring to the other revenue. There are a couple of drivers there that are worth pointing out. The first one is, we have a arrangement with many of our clients where we handle their rewards redemption and we refer to these as pass-through revenues or expenses and so, there has been a pickup in our redemptions over the past year, that was true for this quarter and that pickup is the single largest driver of the growth rate and other revenue and that comes with roughly an equal offset in expense.", "There is some new licensing revenue in this category and this comes from arrangements that we have entered into with the entity we referred to as VisaNet Brazil and up to the time they went public, they would pay us regular dividends. And so the dividends stopped because our share ownership was sold, but instead, we are now receiving licensing fees, and those licensing fees appear in other revenue. The dividends that we used to receive were appearing in other income.", "And those are the two principle drivers for that growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Dodd from Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan", "Just on the pricing that you referenced to, if I remember right, you took a price increase September quarter on data processing. So seeing that flow through, should we be expecting basically lapping of that in the fourth fiscal quarter this year, a slowdown in revenue, or do you have other material pricing initiatives underway to offset some of that lapping effect?", "Joe Saunders", "The one that you are talking about, we would lap in the fourth quarter. We have given guidance on what we expect pricing increases to generate this year in our current guidance. I don\u2019t think that that would cover the shortfall. We have always pointed that out. As it relates to anything else, at the point in time that we make any decision as it relates to that pricing, and whether or not it will affect our guidance, we will disclose that immediately.", "Jack Carsky", "Operator, at this point we probably have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Bob Napoli from Piper Jaffray.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "On debit, we look at some banks that put out their debit spending numbers, and your spending numbers are much higher than on debit or much higher than the banks. And I am wondering, are you seeing new customers and are community banks picking up market share? Is prepaid having a significant effect on debit and also, your international debit, I mean have there been some breakthroughs in international?", "Joe Saunders", "That\u2019s a difficult question for me to answer. We can't grow any faster than our customers. I mean, whatever they grow, we grow. We don't have any volume outside that. We have a prepaid business that's doing quite well, but there is nothing about it that would shock you in our numbers right now. ", "I think that outside the United States, it\u2019s the secular shift and our continued success in being able to make electronic payments in a number of geographies. And Tim, other than that, I think it's the things that financial institutions are doing to encourage the usage of debit cards in the United States. And of course I shouldn't diminish our effect, the effect that we're having on moving things to electronic payments through our promotions, and our advertising in our market.", "Byron Pollitt", "All right, that about wraps it up.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations.", "Jack Carsky", "Welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2010 earnings conference call.  With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.  This call is currently being webcast over the Internet.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.  With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "As we conclude the first half of our fiscal 2010, I\u2019m increasing optimistic that the worst of the recession is behind is because we are finally beginning to see evidence of a pickup in spending domestically and internationally.  This was apparent in the results of our fiscal second quarter as strong year-over-year payments volume and revenue gains were delivered in every area of our business. ", "However, while we are increasingly more comfortable the economic environment in which we are operating, we remain watchful of the longer term sustainability of growth in the world economy.  Earnings for our second fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.96 per diluted share, a $0.25 or 35% increase over the second quarter of 2009.  Net income on a GAAP basis was $713 million, a 33% increase over the year ago period.  ", "Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 19% increase over the year ago period as a result of stronger than anticipated payments volume, cross border volume and process transaction growth coming from all areas of the globe.  Byron will get in to the details but overall we are very pleased with our results and we remain cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see solid trends going forward. ", "Process transaction growth continued to accelerate over the quarter ending the period at 14% on a year-over-year basis with over 10.6 billion transactions processed over Visa net.  This is up from the 12% growth rate we experienced last quarter and well ahead of the same period a year ago when process transactions grew 6%.   ", "With these trends we are increasingly optimistic that our net revenue growth will now come in at the high end of our 11% to 15% range.  While we delivered 16% growth year-to-date keep in mind that we lap last year\u2019s data processing price increase at the end of the June quarter.  In addition, consistent with our annual plan and guidance, we are projecting modestly higher rebates and incentives in the back half of the year.  Byron will provide greater detail on this.", "As you know, last week we announced an agreement to acquire CyberSource.  It\u2019s a strong fit with our long term strategic view of eCommerce and is complemented by its ability to deliver incremental benefits to our financial institution customers and their cardholders.  While we\u2019d be happy to entertain any outstanding questions you may have at the end of this call, please keep in mind that because CyberSource shareholder approval is still pending we will not be able to go in to any more detail on the transaction than we did last week.", "I would refer you back to the presentation and transcript of our comments from the conference call.  Additional information regarding the transaction will be available in the forth coming registration statement Form S4 which will be filed with the SEC in due course.  All-in-all we continue to execute well against our business plan.  Our management team remains very focused on further expanding our payments network globally by growing issuance and acceptance locations, by expanding our processing capabilities, by adapting our products and services to fit the need of individual markets and by driving transactions with effective marketing programs.  ", "As we navigate through the current economic environment, we are generating solid earnings results and will continue to focus on returning excess cash flow to our shareholders.  While we temporarily curtailed our previous announced share buyback earlier in the second quarter, it is our intention to resume share repurchases this fiscal year as conditions warrant.  ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the details of our financial results and then I will back.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April.  As Joe already mentioned, it was a very strong quarter with better than anticipated revenue growth.  Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in the September quarter to 8%.  ", "In the US payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter up from a -1% in the September quarter.  Debit continued to prove both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth compared to 7% growth in the September quarter.  Credit improved to -1% in the December quarter from a -9% in the September period.  ", "On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, a modest improvement over the 8% rate delivered in the September quarter.  These results continue to reflect solid secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US.  ", "Now, turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis.  Globally cross border volume growth continued to improve in the March quarter posting a positive 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.  Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $10.6 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and up from 12% growth we saw in the December quarter.", "Turning to the income statement, in our fiscal second quarter gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 20% from the similar period in 2009.  Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year\u2019s recession influenced level of 15% and in line with our expectations and guidance for fiscal 2010 as payment volume growth improved.  Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 19% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the second fiscal quarter of 2009 driven by better than anticipated global payment volume and process transaction growth in debit, in credit and cross border payments.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenues was $885 million up 10% over the prior year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending December, a trend which continued through the March quarter.  Data processing revenue was $728 million, up 34% over the prior year based on strong process transaction growth of 14% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.  ", "International transaction revenues were up a solid 22% to $545 million due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period.  The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the second fiscal quarter was a positive 2% as a result of the weakening dollar against several key currencies.  While the balance of this year\u2019s revenue forecast is substantially hedged, some quarter-to-quarter volatility may be exhibited due to the timing of hedges and the underlying volatility of currencies.  ", "Overall, for the full fiscal year, we expect the foreign exchange impact of revenue growth to be neutral to slightly positive.  Our operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid to high 50% range.  Higher revenues in the period were offset by higher planned marketing and advertising spend in the quarter.  We expect a similar dynamic in our fiscal third quarter as we ramp up ahead of the FIFA World Cup.  ", "Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $837 million representing a year-over-year increase of $71 million or 9% driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend.  Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis excluding any affect from our pending CyberSource acquisition.", "On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising as well given higher spending on the winter Olympics and upcoming World cup event.  We also saw consolidated personnel expenses as we invest for future growth.  Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter and $79 million year-to-date representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives.  For fiscal 2010 we expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.  ", "Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available for sale investments of $6.3 billion.  Of this total $1.6 billion is restricted cash which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.  The previously announced unlocking of 50% of the remaining locked up Class C shareholdings commenced on March 1st and as anticipated had little discernable effect on our trading activity.  As of the end of March there are a total of $100 million Class C shares outstanding of which $55 million shares remain locked up.  ", "Now, let me comment on March\u2019s payment volume data and our early read on April.  Then, I\u2019ll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.  Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars rose to 13% from a positive 8% in December.  We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions.  In the US payment volume growth was a positive 13% in the March quarter up from a positive 7% in the December quarter. ", "Debit continued its strong recent trend delivering a positive 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December period.  Debit, currently accounts for 57% of total US payment volume.  Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a -1% in the December period.  More recently through the 21st of April, US payment volumes grew at 15%, two percentage points ahead of the March quarter rate but one point lower than the month of March gross rate of 16%.  ", "Further deconstructed debit grew at 22% while credit grew at 7%.  On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter.  These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US.  Global cross border volume growth accelerated considerably in the March quarter hosting a 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.  ", "Growth in the month of March was an unexpectedly strong 16%.  In contrast to our view a quarter ago this trend appears to be more representative of a broader cyclical trend rather than just pent up demand.  April cross border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong growth rate we saw in March posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month.  Process transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior year period up slightly from the 14% growth posted in the second fiscal quarter but down a point from the 16% growth rate delivered in the month of March.", "Now, let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance.  As Joe mentioned, given our year-to-date results we are now comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range.  Despite our year-to-date growth of 16%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics over the back half of the year.  ", "First, the data processing pricing action we took in April of 2009 will lap in our June quarter making year-over-year growth comparisons in this line item less favorable in the fourth quarter.  Second, consistent with our guidance, we expect rebate and incentive costs to increase moderately in the second half due to higher earn out rates tied to the higher volumes we\u2019re experiencing.  Remember, as discussed at our investor day, the level of incentives tied to payment volume growth declined in fiscal year 2009 due to economic conditions.  ", "Consistent with our internal operating plan and our guidance, the level of incentives earned will naturally rise with volume in 2010 with the financial impact weighted more to the second half of the fiscal year.  In addition, we also anticipate signing several new deals, some as soon as the third quarter which may have upfront payments that are directly expensed rather than amortized resulting in some lumpiness to our quarter-to-quarter incentive levels.  That said, consistent with our Q1 guidance, we are still comfortable with full year rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue in the range of 16% to 17% potentially at the higher end.", "Our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid to high 50s.  As exhibited this quarter, increased marketing and advertising expenses as well as further investments in our numerous initiatives offset the higher margin we reported in our first fiscal quarter.  We expect similar  dynamics in our fiscal third and fourth quarters.  We expect our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5%.  We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis excluding the Visa Net Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%.", "We expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million and lastly, our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion which is net of the $682 million pre-payment we made last quarter on the previous settled retailers litigation.  ", "That concludes my comments, so I\u2019ll turn the call back to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "In closing let me say it\u2019s certainly been a very busy and exciting time at Visa.  We are fortunate to sit at the center of a dynamic and highly competitive industry.  Not only are more consumers turning their backs on cash and checks but more government and businesses are embracing the speed, security and reliability of Visa digital currency in every part of the world.  Inevitably along with our success comes increased competition from companies large and small both within and outside the United States.", "However, as we have done on the past, we will continue to challenge ourselves to innovative and adapt to the ever changing competitive landscape.  Importantly, we are taking concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long term growth to the benefit of Visa shareholders and clients.  We are also continuing to build our management team with key hires to lead and operationalize our activities in mobile and eCommerce.", "Even as we look to the future we continue to focus on the tremendous opportunities in our core business, the ongoing migration to digital currency from cash and checks.  By way of example, at the end of calendar year 2009, the number of Visa debit and prepaid cards issued globally surpassed one billion for the first time in our history.  This represents not only further penetration of debt globally but the underlying growth and importance of prepaid cards which are a key contributor of all of our debit business overall.", "In the coming weeks we will increase our marketing activation around our FIFA sponsorship in advance of this summer\u2019s World Cup.  The  majority of these marketing investments will be focused on increasing awareness of the benefits of debit and premium credit products with the goal of driving every day and cross border transactions.  Particular emphasis will be given to markets with strong growth potential and a passion for soccer.", "With this, we are ready to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I guess I\u2019ll focus on emerging markets since CyberSource is sort of off the table for now.  Turning to Brazil, two of the larger banks announced a JV this week.  It certainly can be seen as  threat to you but our industry contacts suggests they\u2019re going after the private label market and not your core offering.  So any color you can provide there would be great and an update in other initiatives like India and Russia would also be appreciated and if you could focus on the support you\u2019re getting from the big banks and government entities in these markets that would be really helpful. ", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "As it relates to Brazil there\u2019s not much to report beyond what you just said.  Every indication that we\u2019ve had, any conversations we\u2019ve had with the individuals at those institutions would suggest exactly what you said Adam.  So we don\u2019t look at this as being threatening to us certainly in the near term.    As it relates to Russia, we\u2019re working well with the government and with Sharebank which is as you know the largest institution as well as other banks.  As a matter of fact I signed an agreement with Sharebank while we were at the Olympics and it covered an agreement on how we were going to operate cooperatively at the Winter Olympics in Russia.", "Sharebank who has actually traditionally been more of a MasterCard bank than a Visa bank is fully committed to issuing only Visa cards from now through the Winter Olympics.  I have nothing new to report on India other than what we\u2019ve reported up to now.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research.", "David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research", "To follow up on the answer to Adam\u2019s question is Sharebank only issuing new Visa cards or are they going to convert from MasterCard to Visa?  Then my real question was just could you give us some color on what you see in the way of cross border spending improvement?  And then, have you seen evidence in this last quarter of a pickup in discretionary spending in credit card?  Is there faster growth in signature cards than in other credit cards?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "Well, I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question which is the simple part.  The answer is I don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re converting anything they have.  I was speaking primarily of new issuance, although that\u2019s over a multiyear period of time.  I don\u2019t know  that they\u2019ll issue zero MasterCard cards but we are their principle partner by far.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "What we see on cross border is that we are seeing just strong cross border gains throughout the globe.  If we were to look at cross border for the second quarter for Visa transactions in constant dollars the category was up 12%, 11% in the US, 12% rest of world.  So it is a broad based recovery on cross border.  Then, with regards to discretionary versus non-discretionary the mix for us for the quarter just ended in the US which is what we have real time visibility to, the mix is now a couple of percentage points higher for non-discretionary.  ", "So in the spirit of your question, we would say that the pickup is still very much debit, very much non-discretionary but with credit starting to show some signs of life.  But, even within our credit portfolio, we\u2019re finding that the mix of non-discretionary is continuing to rise, modestly but continuing to rise.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein Capital.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein Capital", "It sounds like you\u2019re poised to win some new accounts.  Can you give us any profile information on the types of wins you\u2019re expecting in terms of size or geography.  If you can comment on the basis for how you\u2019re wining these deals.  Then also related to that Byron, since you may have some unamortizable expenses attached to these wins should we expect this to be more of a new and common trend in terms of how you deal with the upfront expenses on new wins?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "Let me give you some perspective on that, when we guide at the beginning of the year and by the way let me first say that what is unfolding this year is very consistent with how we planned the year and how we guided to it.  We have every year a natural deal pipeline and natural flow of deals. What\u2019s hard to predict is when those deals will actually renew or come to conclusion and it\u2019s when you actually have a signed agreement that you can then trigger the accounting.  ", "So there is no particular call out on wins, losses, renewals here.  For fiscal year 2010, this is just how the deal pipeline fell and as a result we\u2019re more second half weighted in the incentives than we would book in the first half.  You will notice that we are still affirming that the level of incentives for the year are within the guidance we gave at the Q1 earnings call.  With regards to amortized expense, again I would say there is no call out here that we anticipated a certain amount of incentives being expensed and what we are reporting, although second half weighted is still very much consistent with how we thought the year would unfold.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mosche Orenbauch \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Mosche Orenbauch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just in that same vein following up, could you talk about what perhaps percentage of the annual revenues in those contracts might be comprise?  It would see that that should imply that fiscal 2011 should have some benefits relative to this year?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "We don\u2019t guide or talk about the first part of your question, we don\u2019t break that part out in any detail.  But, the conclusion you\u2019re drawing is fair and I think there are two phenomena here and frankly it has something to do with the deal flow but frankly it\u2019s more about the earn outs.  Fiscal 2009 was a non-normalized depressed incentive year because portfolios did not grow substantively during that year, many of them didn\u2019t grow at all. ", "So what you have in 2010 is the beginning of a return to our more normalized incentive level.  You have growth in the portfolios, you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re now reporting year-over-year positive growth in the credit portfolios not just the debit portfolios and so what is happening is you\u2019re starting to earn a level of incentives and get back to a more normalized level which then rests the base in fiscal year \u201910 and hence you would expect, everything else being equal a more moderated level of incentives in the year that follows, a more moderated level of growth and incentives for 2011.", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "I think I\u2019d add that as it relates to the number of transactions that we\u2019ve consummated over the last two years, it\u2019s partially been a result of the economy and the consolidation of the banking industry and I think we\u2019re pretty much at the tail end of that right now.

Then also as a follow up, are there any other pricing increases that we should be thinking about here for your fiscal third quarter?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "Well we\u2019ve already announced an increase in our acquirers fees similar to the one that MasterCard did and ours is effective in July.

The difference between the 22% in cross border revenue versus the 19% reported volume, Byron is the delta there pricing or did mix continue to the spread widening out there?  Do you follow my question?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "We don\u2019t hedge volumes but we hedge revenue so there\u2019s no real call out here.  With regards to the international it\u2019s tracking pretty close but it will always have several \u2013 I mean it would not be unusual to have several points of difference plus or minus.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "I just wanted to follow up on a comment you had made at the analyst meeting about seeing a narrowing of the traditional GAAP between PIN and sig debt interchange rates.  Can you give us an update on what the impetuous is for this movement?  And, does it also apply to your network fees or is it really just on the interchange side?  Is the goal here to more or less keep the average interchange rate about the same just by tweaking PIN up and sig debit down?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "Well there are parts of that question that I can answer and parts of it that I can\u2019t and parts of it that I shouldn\u2019t.  What I would say to you is that I don\u2019t think the trend from signature to PIN is any much different than it\u2019s been for quite a while and while the PIN volume has grown, so has the signature volume and the signature volume is considerably more than the PIN volume.  It has always been a fact that a merchant can use PIN to any extent that they want.  If the merchant wants to put PIN terminals in then they are more than welcome to do so.  So, what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t in my opinion or from what we can see much different than what\u2019s been going on for quite some time.  By the way which means that it isn\u2019t narrowing anywhere near as rapidly as your questions would suggest.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "I guess a similar question to Tien-Tsin\u2019s.  Just could you go in to more color on the service revenue fee growth?  It looks like service revenue fees lacked your payment volume growth which is a reversal of the trend at least from the past four quarters. ", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "With regard to service fees again, I think what we report on service fees on volumes is unhedged so it is a gross number, nominal, unhedged.  When we report it in our financial statements, it is hedged and so there is always going to be a delta with regards to that.  Now, having said that, I wouldn\u2019t get overly concerned about an individually quarter, you ought to be looking at it over several quarters because there will be ins and outs for the quarter.", "Having said all of that, there is always a degree of variance that will occur simply because there is a difference in mix.  We have one level of service fee yield in the United States which is the single largest source of service fees.  As you move outside the United States we have very different mix profiles so it actually does matter from which geographies the stronger growth rates are coming because if the yield is higher in the faster growing than everything else being equal we\u2019ll have service fee revenues growing faster than payment volume.", "But, if it\u2019s coming from areas that have lower yields on service fees, then we\u2019ll have the opposite.  Then of course, there is a difference between the mix of credit and debit.  Credit carries on balance higher service fee yields than debit.  Then within debit, signature carries a different service field yield signature debit than PIN debit.  So in short there are quite a few factors that go in to the actual translations of payment volume in to revenue and what you see is the outcome of all of those in a given quarter.  All-in-all we feel it is a pretty healthy growth rate and is growing at a rate that is frankly, somewhat above our expectations at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Byron can I just stay on that same point and just add another quick question on that delta card services fees.  How much of that, if any, is attributable to tiering?  In other words people moving so the volume is coming back faster and some of the tier pricing that you would see maybe even a merchant mix situation?  I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if there\u2019s some of that that could also be another factor to kind of contemplate in the delta there?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "I think the answer that I gave earlier, Julio there are a multitude of factors.  I would say that the factor that you just described has very little to do with the calculation.  The added concentration of payment volume would be much more a driver than tearing.  ", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "I think the short answer to everything that Byron has said is that nothing has essentially changed in the way that we do business or the way we generate revenue or what our yields are.  I think that there will be some anomalies on a quarter-to-quarter basis but as he said earlier, look at the year, look at several quarters and you\u2019re not going to see any significant change.

You mentioned some reinvestment there and I was just wondering how we should think about it on an ongoing basis?  Maybe if you could split out the investment spend portion versus the core number there.  The second question was just to your comments that the rebound in volume seems to be related to a broader cyclical trend versus pent up demand.  I was wondering if you could just maybe talk about the specific items that kind of lead you to believe that that is the case?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "On the personnel line, I think just keep in mind that we are coming off a year, namely 2009 where we had a combination of a very uncertain economic environment where it made sense to put a very close watch on expenses.  At the same time we were completing the rationalization of expenses associated with the merging of the various Visa companies at the time of the IPO.  So at the same time we were then, as we completed the rationalization we were then waiting for the right time to really start gearing up and recognizing that we have a lot of secular growth to capture.

It\u2019s not a heavy investment because we are leveraging our platforms but it is time to start growing that line which is what you\u2019re beginning to see.", "With regards to the rebound, we\u2019re just remaining cautious on this front.  There are very mixed views from an economic standpoint as to whether or not what we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s economy even globally is supported by strong fundamentals.  But, there is no denying as I referenced on the cross border transactions, that we are in an environment where the world is traveling again.  I say the world, we don\u2019t have Europe but it seems everyone else is traveling and we\u2019re starting to see a return to growth in the credit portfolios not just the debit.", "When we say positive growth in the credit portfolio, that\u2019s a global comment.  We\u2019re seeing positive growth in our portfolios, both debit and credit in the United States and across the globe.  Whether that will be sustained or at what level remains to be seen but back in December and January it was just hard to know whether, particularly on the cross border front whether we were seeing pent up demand.

It\u2019s unfolding very consistently in terms of a yield standpoint with how we planned the year.  What is proceeding faster is the rate of recovery.  Again, I use the word recovery advisedly but I assure you we did not expect to be generating 19% revenue growth at this time almost a year ago when we were assembling budgets.", "With regards to credit portfolio, I\u2019m afraid our credit growth is being generated by categories that are a little less sexier.

But, let me reiterate that we are an efficient organization, we intend to be a efficient organization, we\u2019re simply refocusing resources where we think that they should be refocused and our intention would be to end the year spending less on that line than we did last year, modestly less but less nonetheless.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A quick question, Joe are the signings in the back half, are these renewals or are they mostly new business?  I guess going on to Byron, are the signing bonuses becoming more prevalent, especially the ones that don\u2019t have the claw backs?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "I don\u2019t think so.  There\u2019s a combination of things that could come together under \u2013 I mean the funny thing about this is would happily come together particularly in the third quarter.  But, they\u2019re not one thing, they\u2019re a number of things and they are in a number of parts of the world.  The real answer to the question is what\u2019s going on, is we continue to attract new business, better business and we continue to excel from a competitive point of view and it\u2019s very, very consistent with our plan and where we want to go and where fortunately we seem to be ending up.  So it would be wrong to say that everything is something new but it would be just as wrong to say that a lot of it isn\u2019t very new.  That\u2019s where we are.", "But you\u2019re not talking about 10%, it\u2019s crippling our revenue growth by 10% or something, you\u2019re talking about amounts of money that may amount to somewhere between 1.5% , 2% to 2.5% of our revenue growth in a particular quarter.  That would be a great quarter. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities.", "Timothy Willi \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "A question on yield and just sort of tying it in to maybe your thoughts around pricing.  I know you\u2019ve commented every quarter about what you expect there but could you talk about how you think about on a multiyear basis impacting revenue yield by value added products whether that be around pools that give consumers more security around using the card or accessibility or prompting.  Is there anything there to think about around revenue yield outside of just price increases that you would highlight?", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "I would say at this point nothing to highlight.  It is very clearly an objective over time to introduce more services that not only will yield more but that will differentiate Visa more relative to more alternative payment forms and of course, that is one of the strategic underpinnings of why we were interested in CyberSource which is a discussion as you know for another day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "I wanted to ask about the prepaid and Joe, thanks for sharing the $1 billion debit prepaid number, that was helpful.  I\u2019m wondering if the growth in prepaid is noticeably different from some of your other products?  And, if as we had dialoged at the analyst day, you might contemplate breaking that out over time, how significant is that for the company?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "We\u2019ve never broken out the absolute significance of it but I think we suggested of the new products that we\u2019re involved in or the new initiatives that we\u2019re involved in this is the most mature.  I think that we would certainly consider breaking it out as we go in to 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Can we get an update on the merchant lawsuit in terms of some of the pending deadlines?   Then, maybe looking at the recent volcano eruption and in terms of can you give us a feel on whether there was an impact on cross border transaction volumes during the June quarter because of that.", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "I\u2019m going to let Byron start out by telling you about the volcano and then I\u2019ll comment.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "What we can say is that for about three days we saw a blip in the forest but it was not a blip of any substantive size in that if I can call it the bounce back, things seemed to have bounced back very, very quickly and so we do not expect to have any call out in the quarter associated with the volcano eruption at this time.  It was an event but for revenue purposes I think for us it was a non event.", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "As it relates to the litigation there are motions that are pending.  There is no trial date that\u2019s been set.  There\u2019s a mediation that\u2019s ongoing but obviously under those circumstances I don\u2019t have anything else that I can report to you about the litigation at this time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Is there anything to read in to the 1% slide in the April volume from March?  Then, is it just my imagination or are you a little skimpy on the guidance for 2011 relative to this time last year?  I don\u2019t see any revenue growth guidance or volume?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "Let\u2019s just level set everything, I talked earlier about the fact that we thought we\u2019d see a little bit of pullback in the second half of the year as it related to our revenue growth due to lapping the pricing increase in the fourth quarter and due to, as Byron said, the lumpiness in the incentive line.  Having said that, our projections for our guidance for the rest of this year are not predicated on a continued rapid ramp up of volume. ", "I also mentioned earlier in my speaking points that while we\u2019re optimistic I\u2019m not betting on a continued recovery that just goes through the roof.  So, that kind of sets where we are in 2010.  Obviously, under those circumstances as it relates to 2011 we\u2019ve talked about the better than 20% growth in our earnings per share but I\u2019m really reluctant to try and specifically pinpoint revenue or some of the other categories until we get a little bit further in the year and I\u2019m a little bit more comfortable where the economy is and where it\u2019s going and where our volume is going.", "We\u2019re poised to do well if the economy does well.  Our success to some extent will follow an economic recovery.  We have enjoyed volume increases up to now by expanding categories and moving in to new geographies, we will continue to do that but that would obviously be enhanced by any worldwide economic recovery or economic recovery in certain pockets of the world.  We\u2019re optimistic but we\u2019re not going to go overboard and I\u2019m going to continue to be reluctant to predict what\u2019s going to happen until I have some more certainty around whether it\u2019s going to happen.", "Byron H. Pollitt, Jr. ", "I would just add to that, that by the time we give 2011 guidance we\u2019d like to be able to include CyberSource in to that guidance assuming the transaction closes in the fourth fiscal quarter.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup.", "Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup", "Joe, in terms of the alternative payments and eCommerce are you sort of where you think  you need to be with our pending acquisition in Right Click?  And, how do you think you stand versus some of the other networks?", "Joseph W. Saunders ", "I think that our recent acquisition is a spoke in the wheel.  I think it\u2019s one of the things we had wanted to do and had thought about doing as we were putting our eCommerce strategies and our strategies for growth in the future together.  I think we talked about that at investor day and so what we\u2019ve just done is consistent with what we talked about but it\u2019s one part of it, it\u2019s not by any stretch of the imagination the entire answer.  But, as it relates to whether I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019re where we need to be given what we need to do, yes I am comfortable or as comfortable as one can be in a rapidly changing environment.", "I think Visa has done a good job over the years in doing the research and the heavy lifting and moving that is enabling us to bring products to market today.  We at Visa as a public company are very fortunate as it relates to some of the things that went on in Visa the association prior to our IPO.  We\u2019re the very fortunate recipients of a lot of infrastructure and a lot of effort and testing and tests in the market that are the type of experience that you can\u2019t buy, you have to experience.  So I think we\u2019re prepared and I\u2019m as confident as ever that we\u2019re ready to move forward.", "Jack Carsky ", "That concludes our call everybody.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph Saunders", "Thanks, Jack, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Visa once again delivered strong earnings results. Against a backdrop of a recovering global economy, we posted net operating revenues of just over $2 billion, a 23% increase over the year-ago period. Revenues were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. Net income on a GAAP basis was $716 million, a 45% increase over the prior year.", "Overall, we more than delivered on guidance with fiscal third quarter earnings on a GAAP basis at $0.97 per diluted share, a 49% increase over the third quarter of 2009. And these figures exclude the impact from the gain from the VisaNet do Brasil sale in the prior-year period. We also successfully completed a de facto $500 million stock repurchase, while continuing to invest in new initiatives that will fuel our future growth.", "On today's call, I'm going to leave the more detailed view of our financials to Byron while I address a few items I'm sure are at the top of your mind. Let me begin by providing color on recent events that have unfolded in Washington.", "It's clear that the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law last week will reshape the U.S. debit landscape. However, precisely how the Wall will impact Visa's business and that of our financial institution clients is yet to be determined. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has embarked upon a rulemaking process to clarify the details of the legislation and how and when it will be implemented. We have an opportunity to inform their deliberations and we intend to participate in the process as a constructive voice.", "In parallel, we have teams at Visa focused on developing a range of business strategies that will enable us to compete effectively in the new environment once the details of the law become clear. So until the Fed finalizes the rules and until we finalize our mitigation response, it's not possible to specifically detail our actions.", "On the other hand, there are things that we do know. First, given the time frames outlined in the legislation, our business should not begin to feel the effects of the legislation until this time next year. Therefore, I do not anticipate any impact in FY '10. And looking ahead to 2011, I expect the impact will be modest and contained to our fourth fiscal quarter.", "With that, I feel confident reiterating our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 at better than 20% growth. And per past practice, we will be updating other guidance metrics for 2011 on our October call.", "We do know that we are working with the best set of assets in the industry. We are the lowest cost provider of debit services. We have deep debit expertise, and we have a powerful brand. We also know that debit delivers tremendous value as evidenced by the growing appetite of consumers, governments and others to use the product and by merchants who accept it. Given our continuing discussions with our clients and the preliminary business strategy options that we have already developed, I'm very confident that we will effectively adapt to the new environment and continue to lead growth in this segment of the business.", "And as you think about our future prospects, it's important to keep in mind that Visa has a globally diverse business. While future opportunities in the U.S. remain, our growth is increasingly likely to come from outside the U.S. borders regardless of the domestic environment. Today, our non-U.S. revenues make up approximately 40% of our business, and one of our stated 2015 goals is to generate half of our revenues from operations in the rest of the world.", "So when I step back and take a global view of our existing business and future opportunities, I'm reminded how strongly I feel that I would rather be Visa than anyone else in our industry. And how personally committed I am to accomplishing the goals we established at last March's Investor Day.", "Turning to the legal front, we have two topics to update you on. We have made progress on our ongoing engagement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its investigation into the payment card industry and its key players.", "We have been cooperating with the department to satisfy the civil investigative demand filed within late October 2008 concerning the major payment networks, rules on surcharging and merchant steering as previously reported, and in recent months, have met with the department on numerous occasions. The department has indicated that it is considering filing a civil lawsuit challenging rules prohibiting surcharging on credit and differential discount in between networks, similar to the claims that have been included within the merchant interchange litigation that\u2019s been pending since 2005.", "Although the outcome is uncertain at this time, we are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without litigation or payment of monetary damages and in a way that proactively addresses concerns in the covered litigation.", "Regarding the covered litigation, it is proceeding on its normal course, and we continue to be actively involved in settlement discussions. As a reminder, this litigation is covered by our U.S. financial institutions under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan.", "That being said, I remain highly confident in Visa's strategic plan introduced earlier this year, which will continue to guide our priorities, initiatives and investments over the long-term. In particular, we remain intensely focused on innovation, which is critical to accelerating growth and further diversifying our revenue.", "To that end, Visa completed the acquisition of CyberSource right on schedule. CyberSource enables us to expand our capabilities and competitive position in e-commerce, one of the fastest-growing segments of the payment industry. Not only do they possess approximately 25% of all e-commerce dollars transacted in the U.S. today, there is also tremendous opportunity for us to expand CyberSource globally, winning the new customers and the potential to increase revenues from international markets. We look forward to commenting on our joint performance in the quarters to come.", "Another innovation priority for Visa is mobile payments. And on that front, among other mobile initiatives, we built upon our existing relationship with Monetize by establishing a joint venture to provide financial institutions and mobile network operators in India, with a technology platform that enables them to offer a range of mobile financial services to consumers.", "Additionally in May, we were selected by the State Bank of India to execute a joint venture in India in partnership with Elavon to help drive the growth of digital currency in this important emerging economy by increasing acceptance and acquiring services.", "We also continued to successfully win new contracts and expand our relationships with issuers, merchants and governments around the globe. For instance, we just signed a five-year credit and debit deal with Tedesco, one of our most important partners in Brazil. It is the largest contract we have ever closed in our Latin-American region.", "And finally, I'm pleased we were able to continue delivering on our strategy to return excess cash to our shareholders in the third quarter via the funding of our litigation escrow, which has the same effect as a $500 million share repurchase. This brought our fiscal year-to-date share repurchase total to almost $1.2 billion, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in this regard over the next quarter.", "Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and I'll be back to wrap up.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and full year guidance.", "Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars, rose to 13% from a positive 8% in the December period. We witnessed meaningful growth in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the March quarter, up from 7% in the December quarter.", "Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December quarter. Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% rate in the December period.", "On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy, diversified country base outside the U.S.", "Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period.", "Growth in the month of June at 18% suggests that in contrast to our view a quarter ago, this is more representative of a broader, cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $11.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and on par with the 14% growth rate we saw in the March quarter.", "Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2.4 billion were up 22% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue, came in at 16%, below the prior-year level of 17% and below our expectation. The expected rate of 18% was predicated on the signing of certain contracts during the quarter, which carry a high level of one-time contra revenue incentives.", "While timing is still uncertain, we project these contracts will be signed in our fourth fiscal quarter, which would elevate the support and incentive line into the range of 17% to 18% of gross revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.", "Net operating revenues in the quarter were just above $2 billion, a 23% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the third fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by broad-based economic recovery and secular growth.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $873 million, up 13% over the prior-year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending March. The growth rate for the June quarter should mirror the March quarter's results.", "Data processing revenue was $792 million, up 31% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14% and the final quarter of previously enacted pricing action. In contrast, our final fiscal quarter will see data processing revenue driven by processed transaction growth, which will be partially offset by yield compression due to two factors. First, recent contract wins and conversions. And second, more clients exceeding volume thresholds which qualify them for lower prices.", "International transaction revenues were up a solid 25% to $574 million due to continuing improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the third fiscal quarter was a positive 1% as a result of continued currency volatility, combined with our hedging activity. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be slightly positive.", "Our operating margin was 56%, in line with our guidance of mid- to high 50s. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $892 million representing a year-over-year increase of $68 million or 8%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend related to the FIFA World Cup and continued investment in growth initiative.", "Our expectation continues to be that expenses for the full year will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, including about $15 million in CyberSource-related acquisition costs, but excluding any CyberSource operating expenses incurred subsequent to the acquisition on July 21.", "On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising given our higher spending on the FIFA World Cup event. We also saw higher professional fee expenses as a result of costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and higher investment in product initiatives and IT infrastructure upgrades.", "We expect to see a further sequential increase in professional fees in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of closing and integration costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and continued investment in product and infrastructure.", "Capital expenditures were $65 million in the quarter and $144 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Based on higher levels of spend in the third and fourth fiscal quarters for all of fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be moderately higher than $200 million.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $7.4 billion. Of this total, $2 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1.5 billion that is currently uncommitted.", "As you recall, in May, we placed $500 million into the escrow account, which had the effect of a 6.7 million share buyback. As of the end of fiscal Q3, Visa's outstanding share count is now 731 million on an as-converted basis.", "Now let me comment on the June quarter's payment volume data and our early read on July. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.", "Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars, rose to 14% from 13% in the March quarter. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up slightly from 13% in the March quarter. Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth, same as the March quarter.", "Credit accelerated to 6% growth in the June quarter from 3% in the March period. More recently, through the 21st of July, U.S. payment volume grew at 13%, one percentage point below the June quarter rate, but one percentage point higher than the month of June growth rate of 12%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 20%, while credit grew at 6%.", "On a constant-dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the June quarter same as the March quarter. These results recognize a continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume grew at 17% in the June quarter on a constant dollar basis.", "Growth in the month of June was a strong 18%. July cross-border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong rate we saw in June, posting an 18% rate of growth through the 21st of the month.", "Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted for the third fiscal quarter, and up slightly from the 13% growth rate delivered in the month of June.", "Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance.", "We continue to be comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 18%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics in the fourth quarter.", "First, the data processing fee increase we implemented in July 2009 lapped in June 2010. This will contribute to a significantly lower growth rate in fiscal Q4 for reasons described earlier.", "Second, we expect volume and support incentives to increase in the fourth quarter for two reasons: First, higher earn-out rates tied to the higher payment volumes we're experiencing. And second, as mentioned earlier, we anticipate signing certain contracts, which, if concluded, would result in an incentive level as a percent of gross revenue of around 18%. This in turn would result in a full year rate at the high end of our previously stated range of 16% to 17%. Our expectation for full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid- to high 50s.", "Increased marketing, advertising and new initiative spending in the second half combined with the CyberSource transaction expenses, offset the higher margin we reported early in the year. We are narrowing our guidance for our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to a range of 37% to 38%, in spite of the year to date run rate of approximately 36%. This refinement reflects an anticipated increase in our effective tax rate in Q4 due to the impact of the CyberSource transaction, the true-up of our state tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as a part of our October 2007 reorganization.", "Taken together, we anticipate that these factors will cause our fiscal fourth quarter effective tax rate to be closer to 40%. The full year 2010 tax rate keeps us on track to reduce Visa's effective rate.", "We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain, and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. Both years include the addition of CyberSource.", "Regarding the CyberSource impact on fiscal 2010 earnings, we expect the Q4 impact on EPS to be $0.03 to $0.04, of which approximately $0.01 is from transaction costs and is already included in our full year operating expense guidance and an additional $0.02 to $0.03 from combined operations largely driven by the amortization of intangible assets arising from the transaction\u2019s purchase accounting. We still expect this transaction to be slightly dilutive in fiscal year 2011.", "Turning to capital expenditures, we are adjusting our expectation around CapEx to be moderately higher than $200 million. And lastly, our projection of free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made on the previously settled retailers litigation, but before the $2 billion spent on the CyberSource acquisition. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe.", "Joseph Saunders", "Thanks, Byron. In summary, I want to underscore my confidence in Visa's future and our ability to drive continued growth both in the United States and internationally.", "Visa remains at the forefront of this highly competitive, dynamic industry after more than 50 years in the business because we have a track record of innovating, adapting and successfully navigating challenges. And we will continue to take concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long-term growth to the benefit of Visa's shareholders and clients. This past quarter was a great example of executing on those goals. With that, I'll open the floor to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Real quickly, looking at both the gross revenue yield and the net revenue yield in your model, seeing some pretty decent uptick there. Kind of taking some of the commentary about the higher rebates and thinking about some of the puts and takes in pricing as we think about the forward quarters. Can you talk specifically about the pricing levers that you guys would have left in the forward quarters as we roll into fiscal 2011 both in the U.S. versus the rest of the world, please?", "Byron Pollitt", "Julio, Byron. So we're just going to respond to the pricing opportunities pretty much what we have said before that we have behind us most of the mark-to-market opportunities, which were more domestic in nature going forward, more of the opportunity that we have. First of all, more modest. Second, it is much more outside the United States. So much more of a rest of world opportunity. We are still in the process of standardizing practices so opportunities still remain. And then of course, with the unfolding legislation that we have in the United States. Once the legislation is clarified, then that will give us an opportunity to relook at the services that we provide that deliver value and look for opportunities to reprice consistent with the strategies that we will be pursuing in the new environment going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Napoli, Piper Jaffray.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Joe, the payment system is somewhat of a mess, I guess. If you look at the changes, some of the big ones, banks less than $10 billion are excluded from the bill. Prepaid cards are excluded. You have this debit exclusivity. As you look at some of those challenges in managing that system, do you think it is -- how do you think that will work? I mean, is it too early to tell? Do you think it's feasible that these smaller banks get excluded in practice? And what are your thoughts around how banks will respond with prepaid cards?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, look, the answer is that I can't specifically answer that question until I get a little bit more clarity in the rulemaking process from the Fed. Now we\u2019ll, as I mentioned, be a positive part of that, but until that happens, it's a little difficult to ascertain. Now we maintain through the process that having a dual-price structure would be difficult, if not impossible, and nothing has happened that particularly changes my mind about that. The solution to the issue does not lie with Visa alone. It lies with several different parties in the chain, as you know, so it's not totally in our control. We will, of course, do everything in our power to adhere to the law of the land. And we're just going to have to see what kind of effort that takes and how other people respond to the same challenge.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Hochstim, Buckingham Research Group.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Yes, I wondered could you give us a sense of how much customer account conversions might have contributed to the debit growth in the U.S. and processed transactions, are they meaningful? Senator Durbin's got some new credit card interchange proposal relating to government cards. I wonder if you have any color on that.", "Byron Pollitt", "On the first part, the conversions did contribute, but very, very, modestly, not material. And on the second part of the question...", "Joseph Saunders", "As it relates to the proposals that Durbin just made, it would have very little effect on interchange in total. I mean, it's de minimis.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Greg Smith from Duncan-Williams.", "Greg Smith - Duncan-Williams, Inc.", "You guys made some changes with regards to the dynamic currency conversion outside the U.S. Just wondering, can you give us an update there? Is that signal maybe a future additional revenue opportunity for Visa?", "Joseph Saunders", "We have rules in place that govern direct currency conversion. We have some of the globe operating under those rules. Some of them have been grandfathered based on practices that existed before Visa merged. And so what we have done is put a moratorium on direct currency conversion, while we study this situation. And so in the months to come, expect to hear more from us on this subject.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JP Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I thought I\u2019d maybe ask about the share repurchases. Just your appetite, Joe, to buy back stock given what's going on. I guess as a follow-up, how much freedom do you have to do something like the $500 million synthetic repurchase that you guys just did?", "Joseph Saunders", "I'm going to turn that over to Byron. There is an authorization existing.", "Byron Pollitt", "So the appetite remains. So I'll just use this as an opportunity to once again reaffirm that management's intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and repurchases. Of the outstanding authorizations that we have today, we have $336 million unutilized, and we will be looking for opportunistic moments over the next several months to use that authorization. And then, of course, we are never hesitant at future board meetings to ask for additional authorization.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Adam Frisch, Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "The next 12 to 18 months is a more uncertain landscape than when you reported your March quarter. And I just wanted to ask two questions about that uncertainty, whether it be legislative- or macro-related. One, has it impacted your plans at all to invest capital in the growth initiatives you discussed at your Analyst Day? Have any of those plans been altered? And two, Joe, you reiterated your 20% EPS growth for next year. Have you incorporated additional scenarios and contingency planning and so forth, and how firm is that guide?", "Joseph Saunders", "At this time I don't have any reason to back off anything we talked about in our March Investor Day. We're moving forward with all of those strategic notions. As it relates to reaffirming the guidance, we're reaffirming the guidance so I mean I think that, that speaks for itself. And we didn't do it without thinking about it. I mean, we didn't do it without looking at what was going on in the economy. We didn't do it without understanding what was happening legislatively. We just didn't do it without being cautious and prudent and thoughtful, and so we're confident that we'll deliver.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Kissane, Bank of America.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Joe, can you give us a little more color on the DoJ situation? I mean that came across pretty complex, I know it\u2019s legalese. But is it a surcharge issue, a credit interchange issue, or just maybe big picture color?", "Joseph Saunders", "There is not an interchange issue with the DOJ. The primary issue is their concern over surcharging, and it relates to credit cards. This is a dialogue that we've had with them for a lengthy period of time. The current conversations are dovetailing with the litigation conversation. So we're in the midst of -- so I think this is just part of the same fabric, and I think that things are moving in a direction that we have anticipated and so we're not unhappy with where we are.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois, Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein Research", "Not that you want to talk any more about the Durbin amendment, but if multiple PIN debit brands are required on all U.S. debit cards, and there are no restrictions on merchants routing, do you think your Interlink business could boost some share or experience some pricing pressure? And then, I guess, a part B to that, have you changed anything in your customer-engagement strategies in light of the Durbin amendment?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, you made some specific statements as to what the implications of the amendment are, and I'm not as certain as you are about how those are going to manifest themselves. And we've already had, of course, had dialogue with our clients. We've had an initial dialogue with the Fed. We\u2019ve continued to pursue it congressionally as it relates to intent. We've looked at who we are. We looked at what we do. We look at what value we bring, and we have a number of different ways to react to the situation that you're referring to. And I think that when everything is said and done, and all the smoke is cleared that we'll continue to do well. What that specifically means, I can't speak to right now. And as it specifically relates to Interlink, it may or may not affect Interlink per se, but that's just part of our business. I mean we have a PIN Debit business and a Signature Debit business. And maybe there's less distinction between the two, maybe there isn't. I think we'll have to wait and see. But either way, we're prepared.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg, UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS Investment Bank", "I was hoping you could compare for us your conviction level, if you will, now versus a quarter ago. Just in terms of this volume recovery in your business being sustainable and not just mostly a function of easy year-over-year comps. I think you've made it pretty clear on the cross-border side that you think it's more than just pent-up demand. But putting cross-border aside, we\u2019d just love to get a qualitative sense on how you're leaning now versus a quarter ago in terms of sustainability?", "Byron Pollitt", "So let me take that one, Jason. Let me share a few more granular numbers to give a little bit of perspective. I would say overall, our view is that we are in recovery. What we're seeing on balance suggests maybe a lower probability of a double dip than what we might have suspected a quarter ago. But we also believe that the recovery is going to be protracted. When you look at it on a month-by-month basis, the numbers are certainly good, given the prior-year comps. But you're going to have some bumps along the way, and hence, the notion of a recovery without turbulence, our guess is it's not in the cards. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we saw the last several months for the U.S. This is all-in payment volume. Let's start with March. March payment volume increased 16% then went to 15% in April, then it went to 15% in May. Then it dropped to 12% in June, still a good number, but a little turbulent. And July, through the 21st of July, it's positive 13%. So all suggesting recovery. But whether it will be consistently upwards sustaining and accelerating, hard to call.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Craig Maurer, CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Regarding your marketing budget, you've guided to under $1 billion. The number hasn't strayed that far from there over the last few years. I was wondering if you view that number as enough to sustain you going forward and you probably just move marketing regionally as you have to. But that the $1 billion number seems like a reasonable target going forward.", "Joseph Saunders", "Let me offer the initial response. We will look to give you an update on annual guidance going forward at the next earnings call. That's our custom, to guide at the beginning of the year. It has been around $1 billion for the last couple of years. And in light of the unfolding recovery in the economy, where we stand in the environment, hopefully clarified by then in the U.S., we'll take a very hard look at where the marketing dollars yield the most return. And then, on a bottoms-up basis come to a total and give you some reference points at the next earnings call.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Don Vendetti [ph 57:17], Citigroup.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Joe, certainly understandable that there's going to be some time before you can really assess the risk around Durban and debit. But is there any scenario, I mean are we talking about just arrested growth rates or is there a scenario where you could have to reduce your fees to the banks? And are you feeling any pressure from the banks as they look at their different scenarios?", "Joseph Saunders", "I don't think that there's any pressure that we're feeling right now that we haven't been feeling for quite some time. I think we've been in a competitive environment for a while. This probably exacerbates it to a certain extent. I obviously can\u2019t get into talking about any of our contracts specifically. I think that we have thoughtfully taken our relationship with our clients into consideration in giving you our current guidance. And beyond that, there isn't much I can say. I mean, look, there are different things that can happen as a result of the Financial Services Act, and we'll have to see what that means. I really don't believe in my heart of hearts that it's going to stop the electronic payments from growing in the United States. And I really believe that Visa will be a significant part of that in the future as we are now. What that means, what form that takes, how that changes our business model is not -- I'm just not able to specify that at this particular point in time. But you should take some confidence in knowing that we are paying attention. We\u2019re not just sitting on our hands waiting for something to happen. We are aware of the different directions that things can go and we are aware that different things will come into play. But to specify that publicly right now is just not possible.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tom McCrohan with Janney.", "Thomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Yes, two quick questions on the growth in payment transactions. They grew $1 billion sequentially primarily due the U.S. debit cards. If it was not new clients converting such as WaMu, what drove the really strong sequential growth in U.S. debit cards?", "Joseph Saunders", "Some of it was WaMu. I mean some of it was WaMu and some of it was -- we did have some conversions. And I think that Chase started putting out Visa cards last July and started their conversions in January and the conversions are still going on and will go on through the end of the year.", "Byron Pollitt", "I would just add to that, that in addition to the conversions, we are perhaps seeing a build in recovery. Remember, we are comping off of a pretty low volume last year that is -- relatively, we had actually negative-payment-volume growth last year. So we are ramping up. And then, in addition to that, you have your conversions that are contributing to that. So it is an underlying resurgence in the business. Consumers spend within that. And then on top of that, you have an extra increment associated with the wins that we've experienced and conversion.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Brendler, Stifel, Nicolaus [Stifel Financial Corp.]", "Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Lots of questions on Durbin. I have one as well. The one area that I can\u2019t put my hands around it and I was hoping, Joe, you could give me some color commentary since you\u2019ve been in the business for so long. Is the prospect of merchant discounting, is that a significant risk? It seems like that could be a pretty big impact on payments volumes, discounting for cash or PIN debits becomes a big part of U.S. payment system. Do you have any color you can provide on just how big that risk is?", "Joseph Saunders", "We've allowed discounting for a number of years. The definition of how someone can discount has been modestly expanded. But frankly, we've never looked at that as a significant risk. I mean, we've always been okay with the notion of discount. We've had a little bit more trepidation as it relates to surcharging, but not at this time.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tim Willi, Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Question about CyberSource and maybe the longer-term implications of the mobile in the commerce world. Is there anything in that business model or as you envision those markets developing both domestically and overseas that would have any kind of secular shift on the revenue yield in terms of purchase volume or revenue per transaction? Again, as you advance that strategy which I think you said CyberSource is pretty critical to?", "Joseph Saunders", "We have not looked at it so much from the yield side as just the raw, secular revenue opportunity. And you particularly singled out mobile as opposed to the e-commerce space, which is one of the, if not our fastest-growing source of transactions, many of which are cross-border. So from that standpoint on the transaction basis to the extent that there is a disproportionate number of cross-border transactions within the e-commerce space that we're seeking, yes, the yields could be significantly higher. But you focused specifically on mobile, and in our view, there are going to be, particularly in the developing and emerging countries where a U.S.-type infrastructure is simply not in the cards, there is a significant opportunity for mobile to be the plastic of the emerging and developing world. India, it is why we are so focused on building out our business in India because mobile is such a good match with the infrastructure that will be cost effective for that enormous country.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets", "Byron, could you put a little bit of an order of magnitude around compression in the data processing field in the fourth quarter? And then, also a little bit of a decline in the service fee yield this quarter. That's been ongoing. Could you comment just on what's going on there?", "Byron Pollitt", "So let me talk about the data processing first. I think the biggest dynamic, as you transition from three to four in terms of quarters, is that we've lapped the pricing action that we took last year. That's by far and away, the single, largest dynamic. And from a modeling perspective, the way you might think about looking at data processing as I described in my opening remarks is that if you began with the underlying transaction growth, Visa processed transactions are the primary driver of data processing. And then, basically what we're saying is that as volume is building, a lot of that volume is going to clients that are already in our lowest pricing tier, or we're putting more of the volume in lower pricing tiers. And that's a natural outgrowth of the healthy growth in the business and what happens when you have increasing economies of scale. We share that with our clients. And so that's basically the dynamic on the data processing side. On service fees, it's a much more complicated dynamic. I wouldn't read too much into month-to-month shifts. And so, hard to comment surgically on that. I would just say, there's no material callout today on service-fee trending.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Parker, Lazard Capital Markets.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "During the quarter, you released a new e-commerce product, Payclick, in Australia that stacks up better with PayPal than Right-Click did. Can you just comment on your strategy with that product and how you might use the CyberSource acquisition to get closer to the merchant and penetrate that channel?", "Joseph Saunders", "On Payclick, literally in June, we just launched a pilot. And as you pointed out, that was done in Australia. So it is very, very early days in that. We'll have much more to talk about that going forward, but early days on that. Pilot just underway. Stay tuned.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I just have a quick question on pricing changes. I seem to recall there was a pricing change that would kick in, in July. One, I wanted to make sure that was the case. And two, just want to make sure that was incorporated into the revenue guidance.", "Joseph Saunders", "The answer is, there was a pricing action that took effect in July. But because of the quarter lag in our reporting of service fees, that won't actually show up until the first fiscal quarter of next year. And on the second part of your question, it is incorporated in the guidance that we have given for fiscal year 2011.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Mammone, Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess the one area on revenues that sort of misses the mark as far as where we were modeling with international transaction fees, especially given the easy comp with last year's. Anything to call out there? And then as a follow up just on the incentive line, were there any recurring themes on why a lot of these deals got pushed out to beyond the third quarter? And I guess, what are the chances that you don't get some of those signed and sealed until fiscal '11?", "Joseph Saunders", "No call out on the international. It is somewhat impacted by currency, but basically, we just outperformed during the quarter. And this has been a significant upside for us during the year. Just to give you all a little color, in month of April in constant dollars, cross-border volume was up 15; May, 19; June, 18; July through the first 21 days, 18, and that compares to the first month of the fiscal year when cross-border was zero. So this has been a very good story for us through the course of the year. With regards to timing of contracts, this is always hard. It's just hard to pick the quarter. And so nothing to read into this other than the pace has probably slowed a bit because with our U.S. banks given the dramatic attention that Washington has commanded over the last two quarters. Other than that, I would say nothing in particular to read into it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bruce Harting, Barclays Capital.", "Bruce Harting - Barclays Capital", "It's hard to differentiate over these last few months of underperformance between fears of double-dip or the things that have happened in the legislation. But I would just be curious to your view on the feedback you get, what is weighing more heavily on the stock? Is it implications from the Durbin amendment or just fears of a double-dip? But Joe, your comment that Durbin won't impact \u2019til this time next year, so therefore, might have impact on fourth quarter next year. Thus, 20% EPS growth is still in place is very reassuring new guidance today, which thank you. But in the past, the President of Australia suggested there wouldn't be an impact on Visa. So I\u2019m just wondering are you implying that there may be -- is that a change in the view from Australia that the Durbin amendment may indeed impact you? And is it too simplistic to simply divide -- to get to per card debit spend, I get about $2,500, if I just take total cards by annual debit spend. Couldn't the banks simply, that's about $25 a year of income at a 1% average debit fee, couldn\u2019t the banks simply replace that with some other form of fee in their bundled checking account structure and recoup what they lose in debit interchange? So sort of another reason I'm wondering why it seems like you might suggest post 2011, there could be an impact on the fees you receive.", "Joseph Saunders", "I don't know that I indicated that I thought that there was going to be an impact one way or the other. I just said that I have clarity as it relates to where we are for the last quarter of this year and next year. I also said I wasn't sure of all the implications. And I wasn't sure of exactly how we would position ourselves in response to some of the implications. But if I indicated to you that I thought there was a storm on the horizon, I didn't mean to. I'm just not going beyond 2011 at this particular juncture. As it relates to your question about our stock, you guys have more to say about that than I do. You tell me what happened. That's not my job. My job is to tell you who we are, how we're performing and how we see our performance in the future and that's what we're doing.", "Operator", "The last question does come from Jamie Friedman, Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Just as we tune the model, Byron, the personnel expenses were somewhat lower than what we had modeled, but the professional consulting fees were higher. I realized you said the professional consulting fees were related to CyberSource. Will those sunset as we move into fiscal '11, and is the reduction in personnel expenses sustainable?", "Joseph Saunders", "With regards to CyberSource, we had some impact in pro fees in the third quarter. We will have much more in the fourth because we closed out the transaction during that quarter. And so, most of the direct CyberSource cost that are specifically deal-related will hit in the fourth and, of course, will not recur. We could easily have some integration costs that will stretch over into the early part of fiscal year '11. But the CyberSource fees pretty much goes away at the end of this quarter. Personnel, we're not going to talk about that specifically. But what we will do on the next earnings call is give you a sense as to where we see revenue growth and where we see margins, operating margins, which will encompass personnel, and don't be surprised if we have a word or two on marketing.", "Jack Carsky", "Well, that concludes the call. Thank you, everybody, for joining us here today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, please feel free to call either Victoria or myself.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. ", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. The PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe", "Joseph Saunders", "Thanks, Jack, and as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa began fiscal 2011 with another very strong quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over last year. As has been the case for several quarters now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross border volume and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe. ", "Net income for the quarter was $884 million, a 16% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2010. As previously reported, early in October, we funded the litigation escrow by an additional $800 million, which has the same effect as the share repurchase. Later that month, our board authorized a $1 billion repurchase program, which we actively executed upon during the first quarter by buying over $300 million worth of shares. So we're off to a good start in terms of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Byron will provide more additional detail on the repurchase. ", "Nearly one year ago at Visa's inaugural Investor Day, we laid out our long-term strategy that would drive continued revenue growth. Key to this strategy is maintaining a dual focus on growing usage of our core products, which drives the majority of our revenue today while simultaneously advancing an aggressive innovation agenda to accelerate long-term growth through new platforms and channels. ", "During that same event, we also made a commitment to further diversify our business, including a long-term goal of ensuring our revenues more fully reflect Visa's global presence. We continue to make steady progress on achieving our aspiration of having more than 50% of revenue come from outside the United States by 2015. ", "Consistent with that objective, in this quarter, just over 60% of total revenue growth came from Rest of World. VisaNet is the key asset that enables Visa to deliver on these innovations and revenue diversity commitments. As we invest in long-term growth initiatives, we will maintain the unmatched scale, reliability, security and convenience that we deliver today. Our competitive advantages in this regard are significant. VisaNet's processing infrastructure is unparalleled in its capabilities, enabling us to deploy those assets and drive more volume and more value to networks and its participants. ", "Importantly, the flexibility of VisaNet allows us to lead the evolution of our industry towards payment into new technologies and form factors that will spur the future growth of this industry. To illustrate that point, I'd like to provide you with our most recent updates on key initiatives. ", "First, we will look at eCommerce and Money Transfer, two critical channels to driving usage of our products. Growing our eCommerce business remains a top priority for Visa and will be an area of increased emphasis in fiscal 2011. Our investments in this category to date are yielding results as we saw 25% year-over-year growth in eCommerce payments volume globally in Q1. ", "CyberSource enables us to accelerate growth of the eCommerce category overall by extending Visa's capability to deliver innovation to merchants, consumers and partners with services such as fraud management and payment security management. CyberSource got off to a great start in 2011, delivering 40% year-over-year growth in billable transactions in the first quarter. ", "We have also made progress in driving future growth by continuing to expand merchant relationships with new wins such as Hertz and Tommy Hilfiger. We also signed up LAN Airlines thanks to a lead from our Visa LAC team that demonstrates the synergies that exist for building the business through shared lead generation. ", "We've also begun making targeted investments to expand CyberSource's international footprint, including adding personnel to our existing office in Singapore, establishing a legal entity in Brazil and assessing the landscape in our CEMEA region. While the international build out will take time, we are excited about the opportunities for growth. ", "Money Transfer is an example of our commitment to leading the evolution in payments, giving consumers a new channel to use their credit, debit and prepaid products. In fact, today, I'm pleased to announce substantial progress on that front. ", "We have expanded our partnership with MoneyGram to introduce the first cash-to-Visa account program for remittances from the United States to Mexico, which according to the World Bank is the largest remittances corridor in the world. Utilizing the strength of our global network, this program allows consumers in the U.S. to visit any of the 35,000 MoneyGram locations to send funds directly to any Visa credit, debit or prepaid account in Mexico in a fast, secure, reliable and cost-effective way. ", "Money Transfer holds significant potential for our business, both in the U.S. and globally. In addition to our strong partnership with MoneyGram, we are currently engaged with other leaders in the field to pursue additional opportunities. ", "As a leader in product innovation, prepaid is an area where we will continue to invest and foster global growth. In the U.S., our efforts to support issuers of major government prepaid programs continue. ", "With the Bank of America, we recently launched a significant prepaid disbursement card program for the state of California Employment Development Department. Additionally, the state of New York recently announced the launch of a Visa prepaid pilot program with Chase bank that will streamline how payments are made to parents receiving adoption subsidies. ", "Adoptive parents now have the option to receive those funds through a Visa-branded prepaid card issued by Chase instead of receiving their funds by check. ", "More and more, we see prepaid making a case for itself in every pocket of the globe and particularly, in emerging markets. This is true from Botswana and Georgia, two countries that recently partnered with Visa to introduce their first prepaid product solutions to India and Pakistan, which are further along the payments development curve. ", "In India, Visa developed the payment solution for the Unique Identification Authority of India to support that country's massive national program to issue unique identification numbers to local residents. This program has the benefits of deepening our relationship with the State Bank of India, potentially growing the number of transactions on Visa's network and advancing our goal of financial inclusion for underbanked individuals worldwide. ", "And in Pakistan, we are gratified to see the progress that has been made since we joined the government of Pakistan and United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah and Habib Bank Limited to launch a national aid disbursement card program after last summer's floods. More than 1.4 million cards have been issued, delivering $317 million in humanitarian aid, one of the fastest rollouts of a disbursement program of this kind. ", "All of us who have been reading the news have seen a clear build up of excitement and attention around mobile payments, and we absolutely agree. The convergence of payments with mobile devices is a significant development in the evolution of digital currency and a top priority for Visa. Visa's presence in mobile payments is already well established worldwide with 25 payment programs in 19 countries worldwide. ", "We expect international markets will continue to be amongst the fastest adopters of this innovative payments technology. That said, we announced the commercial availability of mobile contactless payments in the United States and in other select markets. Last quarter, I said that we were standing on the threshold. And now for the first time in Visa's history, a mobile contactless payment solution is officially included in the list of Visa-compliant products available for use by our client financial institutions. ", "Wells Fargo has joined Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bank in piloting the technology with their customers. The solution works with existing contactless payment terminals installed at retail outlets worldwide, enabling Visa account holders to simply hold up their phone to pay for purchases. ", "We recognize that the U.S. market is complex and will require an inclusive approach that addresses the specific needs of all stakeholders. However, I believe Visa's network and payment expertise offers significant competitive advantage over new entrants, and I'm confident that we will play a key role in the evolution of mobile payments in the U.S.", "Visa's presence in the mobile channel also offers opportunity to build deeper relationships with existing customers as well as connect new participants with Visa through value-added products and services. An example is our recent launch of the Visa Mobile iPhone application, now available as a free download from the iTunes app store. ", "The application delivers customized discounts and is tailored to consumer's preferences and physical location, which enables merchants to reach consumers in a targeted way and gives consumers access to exclusive deals not available to other shoppers. ", "Security is another area in which we are evolving and differentiating Visa through innovation. Just last month, we announced significant improvements to VisaNet security capabilities, which will dramatically improve our ability to detect and prevent global electronic payments fraud. ", "By enhancing the underlying processing platform that powers Visa's advanced authorization offering, we are enabling our issuers to isolate fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in real-time. And historical data tells us that this could help identify an incremental 29% of the global fraud annually. Not only is this applicable domestically but more importantly, in cross border applications, where you have higher incidences of fraud and so have greater levels of denied authorizations. Enhanced measures will allow for a greater number of transactions. ", "It's often easy to take our reliable, secured global processing capabilities for granted. But the reality is that as technology enables new payment platforms and competitors, our processing excellence will differentiate and advantage us competitively. So in that regard, I'm pleased to report that we had a flawless peak season of transactions processing, which means that we achieved 100% success in authorizing and settling all transactions between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. This marks the 18th year in a row that we have hit this mark.  ", "That captures some of our most recent highlights and there will be more to come. Overall, we believe that we are operating from a position of strength, fully utilizing our assets and points of differentiation. Our competitive advantages are significant and will continue to enable us to deliver the payment in commerce solutions that consumers and merchants want. ", "Finally, I'd like to close with our thoughts about the recent legislative developments in the United States. With respect to the Federal Reserve's initial recommendations related to the debit provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, we believe the government is engaging in price mix into the benefit of virtually no one. ", "The debit price control legislation has been policy and requires thorough review and revision before potential implementation. To that end, we're working with the entire industry to help the 112th Congress and the Federal Reserve better understand how the provisions create significant unintended consequences that will harm consumers, the economy and financial institutions of all sizes, even if those institutions were supposedly exempt from the regulation. ", "Because of these threats, particularly the harm to the consumers, we believe Congress should re-examine the Durbin provisions and delay implementation to more carefully consider the complexities and unintended consequences of the provisions. Joint federal agencies should also provide an objective assessment of the impacts and present their findings to Congress for review and debate. ", "We are encouraged by the increasing number of voices speaking up about the unintended consequences of this legislation, most notably the authors of the financial reform, Representative Frank and former Senator Dodd. ", "We believe it is noteworthy that Representative Frank has indicated a willingness to work with those who are similarly concerned and amend the debit provisions to allow financial institutions to recover full costs associated with want running a reliable and secure debit network. ", "I've never seen the industry, including banks of all sizes, this engaged and coalesced around working together to improve the outcome. We and others in the industry are looking forward to participating in Representative Bachus' proposed hearing on this legislation, currently planned for mid-February. As we have seen, the more this issue is debated, the more questions are raised about who will really benefit in the end. ", "While we don't know yet the final rules, Visa is working aggressively to protect the interests of consumers and our clients, and we'll support the industry's activities to shape the legislation that impacts community banks, credit unions and larger banks alike. ", "But no matter the ultimate outcome, I want to say to you that we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth over the long term. We have developed a priority set of business strategies and are ready to deploy them when the law is finalized, allowing us to utilize our people and our assets to drive us successfully towards our goals. As you can appreciate, I think it's inappropriate to elaborate further on these strategies at this time for a host of reasons. ", "And now over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. Our business results reflect continued positive economic momentum, which remains global in scope. We saw solid worldwide growth driven by increases in cross-border travel and healthy gains in both credit and debit payment volumes. Now let me quantify these trends. ", "First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the September and December quarters, as well as payment and transaction results for the first four weeks of January. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter, followed by guidance updates for fiscal year 2011. ", "Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 14% and improved slightly in the December quarter to 15%. We saw the following breakdowns in December quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, down slightly from 13% in the September quarter. ", "Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up two percentage points from the 15% rate in the September quarter. More recently, through the 28th of January, U.S. payment volume growth moderated to a positive 10%. Although not yet available, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be significantly higher. ", "Global cross border volumes delivered a healthy 15% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter as the world continued to travel. And more recently, through the 28th of January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis sustained momentum with a 16% rate of growth. ", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 15% over the similar period a year ago and just slightly behind the 16% growth rate we saw in the September quarter. Through the 28th of January, processed transactions stayed the course, posting growth of 14%. ", "CyberSource billable transactions totaled $987 million for the quarter, a very strong 40% growth rate. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as eCommerce activity continues to grow both in the United States and internationally. ", "Now turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.6 billion were up 13% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, a 14% increase over the first quarter of 2010, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing sectoral growth and better-than-anticipated cross border transaction. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was just over $1 billion, up 22% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending September and the impact of pricing adjustments. ", "Data processing revenue was $844 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter based on strong processed transaction growth rates for both Visa-processed and CyberSource transactions. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth was moderated by the impact of key contract renewals last quarter and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting gateway pass-through revenues and expenses. ", "International transaction revenues were up 14% to $630 million due to the sustained improvement in cross border volumes during the period. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 15%, a little lower than our guidance but on track with expectations. We still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for the entire year. ", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $872 million, up 17% from the prior year, driven by the incremental expense from the acquisition of CyberSource as well as the non-recurrence of our prior year onetime benefit of $41 million associated with the prepayment of the retailers litigation. ", "Additionally, remember that we announced an earnings-neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. As a result, $67 million of revenue and expenses, which were booked in Q1 fiscal year 2010 will not re-occur in Q1 fiscal year 2011. ", "In the first quarter, this represented four percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral and will impact revenue growth. ", "The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the first fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 1% increase compared to the same year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 61%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund necessary long-term investments across our entire business. ", "One callout on depreciation and amortization. While the CyberSource acquisition added $22 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter, as an offset, beginning this fiscal year, we no longer recognize the $17 million in quarterly amortization for the asset step-up that was applied when we first merged in 2007. This step-up became fully amortized at the end of September 2010. ", "Capital expenditures were $75 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.5 billion. Of this total, $2.7 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining five quarterly payments with $2.3 billion uncommitted as of the end of the first quarter. ", "As Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we effectively repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of Class A shares at an average per share price of $72.08. This resulted in the lowering of our outstanding share count by 15.3 million shares, taking us to 713 million on an as-converted basis at the end of the fiscal first quarter. ", "Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to be active buyers of our shares in the future at prices that align with our long-term view of the value of our shares. At the end of this fiscal quarter, $694 million of open-to-buys still remains from the $1 billion authorization approved in October. ", "Last week, we announced the early release of all remaining locked up Class C shares. This means 55 million shares will become eligible for sale on February 7, a month and a half ahead of the prescribed unlock date of March 25. All Class C shares sold in the public market after this date will automatically convert to Class A shares. As a reminder, the release does not increase our outstanding share count nor is there any dilutive effect. ", "In order to broaden our participation in the Brazilian prepaid market, we recently announced the sale of our 10% stake in Visa Vale issuer, CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Bradesco. CBSS will continue to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil. ", "Visa's gross proceeds from the sale are $103 million. Upon regulatory approval, we will recognize an estimated pretax gain of approximately $85 million net of transaction costs, and we'll record the event in investment income. The amount of the gain, net of tax, is estimated to be approximately $44 million. ", "As for our guidance for 2011, given the results to date and little incremental clarity from the recent initial Fed rule-making, we have no changes from our prior outlook. As evidenced by our stock buyback, we remain optimistic about Visa's growth prospects over the long term. Once the final rules have been promulgated by the Fed, we will be in a better position to share with you our views on the financial impact to Visa in 2012. ", "And with that, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about Money Transfer and how you sort of see your expansion plans, not only geographically, but if you'd also shed any light on sort of the economics that are shared between you and future Money Transfer partners. How do you think about that occurring as the business opportunity evolves?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, I think we've mentioned pretty succinctly the arrangement that we have with MoneyGram, and much of the revenue that we generate out of that comes through the transactional volume on our cards, both at the front and the back end of the transaction. Beyond that, Money Transfer is an integral part of our mobile strategy or our mobile technology strategy, both domestically and outside of the United States. I think that money transfer takes on different forms, depending on what part of the world it occurs in. The transactions or the cards that we provided in Pakistan are a good example of how something might be manifest. Some of the things that we are beginning to think about doing in India also would embrace that notion. As it relates to our financial arrangements between various different parties from a Money Transfer point of view, I think I'll decline to comment on that at this point in time, but we are excited about the notion of money transfer and how it will fit into our nook going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies", "As far as your goals for 2015, over 50% of your revenue international, looks to me like -- I mean, are you progressing faster than you thought? It looks -- I mean your revenue, your payments volume is down to 55%. Now U.S. actually down 200 basis points just quarter-over-quarter, and it looks to me like you might get your payment volume under 50% in U.S. maybe in one year to a year and a half. So are you progressing faster? And what is the difference in the revenue yield on the U.S. and international?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, there are differences in our yields around the world, depending on what business we're in in various different geographies. Having said that, I mean as it relates to your question, I think we have a goal out there. I think we're well on our way to meeting that goal. We might get it done a little bit faster. Remember, I've talked about country acceleration strategies, and we're doing much better in Brazil and Russia than we had thought we'd be doing. We think that the same thing will happen in Japan, and we're looking at several other countries right now. I can't bring that all together as succinctly as you might like and say, \"Hey, we're going to have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in two years or a quarter, three years.\" But we are well on our way to getting to that point, and let me re-emphasize what I said in the comments. And that is that 60% of our growth in the past quarter came from -- revenue growth came from transactions outside the United States.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS Investment Bank", "Joe, just wanted to pick up on some of the comments you made around what's going on in Washington and just to get your sense if there is truly a genuine effort within Congress to pursue legislation that would actually change the language of the Durbin amendment. And absent that type of legislation, do you feel that the public comment period and lobbying by various folks on the Hill would be enough to try and make the final version of the rules much less onerous on the industry than the initial proposals? Because it seems like the Fed kind of came out December 16 and said, \"Hey, it doesn't really matter whether we like the Durbin amendment or whether it makes logical sense.\" They're simply charged with writing rules that implement the language and intent of the amendment, and they kind of said, \"Hey, our hands are tied.\" So I just wanted to get a sense from your vantage point, is the approach here to really push the legislative path to try and actually get the language of the amendment changed as opposed to just work kind of softer lobbying channels, which was kind of done back in November and December and at least, as it relates to the initial proposals, didn't seem to have a big impact on the Fed's initial decision making?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, I learned in November and December that it is foolish to try to predict exactly what Congress will or will not do. Having said that, I think I lean towards agreeing with you as it relates to the Fed and what they are able or not able to do. And while I don't think that dialoguing with the Fed or sending opinions or commenting about what's already out there, as we are supposed to do, is over and while I don't necessarily believe that some things can't be changed at the margin, I would say that the focus would be the Congressional focus at this particular time. And our position as well as I think every other financial institution in the United States is that the enactment of this legislation should be delayed and the unintended consequences should be studied, and it should require some action to reinstate or to bring into that anything associated with this amendment predicated on the findings of that study.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Adam Frisch, Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "The question we get a lot is around the fiscal '12 guide. And while you were able to give the fiscal '11 outlook, which theoretically includes one quarter of the Durbin impact, but not a view on fiscal '12. So Byron, my question for you is can you provide at least some color on the influences to the P&L in 2012 as a result of the regulatory activity?", "Byron Pollitt", "Our view has been from the beginning that when we guide to 2012, we would like the benefit of being able to interpret the rules that the Fed has promulgated and to put them into the context of the mitigation strategies and our go-forward strategies in the debit arena that we have crafted knowing that once the rules are clarified, we will know which ones are relevant. We'll be able to much better size the impact by line item and be able to give to all of you much more thoughtful guidance than we would today, which would be largely speculative. And so until the rules are clarified at which point we'll be able to -- we'll be much more open about what our competitive strategies would be at that time, we're going to defer at least another quarter before we address 2012.", "Joseph Saunders", "Having said that, we've repeatedly suggested, by buying back our own stock and by publicly making comments, that we believe that Visa will survive and be a very viable growth company in the future, regardless of the outcome, the specific outcome of the legislation. But the specifics of that and the timing of what happens and how things may or may not happened really is, as Byron said, pretty dependent on what the final outcome of everything is currently happening becomes. I will remind you that the majority of our growth in the past quarter did not come from the debit card business. Much of it came from outside the United States and from other initiatives that we have within the United States. And I'll remind you that the debit business is about in the neighborhood of 20% of our total revenues. So I, again -- and of course, without being specific, we're not going to lose all that business under any circumstances. So you're going to have to think about it in your own terms, but we are excited about Visa's future, and we'll be specific about how excited we are when we have a framework in which to communicate it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Kind of as a follow-up to what Adam just asked, I saw in the 10-Q that you know that it's going to be possible to mitigate the negative impacts from the Reform Act. And I'm curious, are these mitigation efforts going to come from primarily diversifying away from the U.S. and growing the international business like you just talked about, Joe? Or do you have a game plan in place in the U.S. to, I guess, reinvent the business model, particularly in debit? I'm not really looking for details. I'm just trying to rank the two in terms of priorities as we think about modeling the midterm -- the longer-term outlook for Visa?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, certainly, not all of our mitigation efforts will be focused on increasing our revenue outside the United States, although that is and has been, even prior to Durbin, one of our primary objectives, and it's an important part of who we will be in the future. But there are mitigation efforts that we will back against the business in the United States. And as we've just said, I mean, I'm not going to go into detail, but we're not going to turn our back on the United States. And we expect to grow revenue and develop our business whatever the outcome of the legislation is.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros, Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Byron, real quickly, just on the expense side, a little bit higher than what we were looking for here on the personnel side. Obviously, it looks like you guys have the inclusion of the CyberSource stuff and talked a little bit in 10-Q about having some additional headcount. And then on the other line item, I guess if you could also address the G&A side with a comment about the reserves for potential government assessment? How big is that? And is that a recurring item? Or it was just a onetime item?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes. So on the personnel side, the major callout is we are lapping a quarter in which we did not have CyberSource. So we are -- that's the single largest component being added to the personnel line year-over-year. And then in addition to that, we are actively staffing our growth initiatives outside the United States. And so as we continue to put more boots on the ground to drive and accelerate revenue growth outside the U.S., you're going to see some of that in the personnel line, which will be somewhat amplified by the weakening U.S. dollar. So you are seeing some foreign exchange impact in that line as well. With regards to the G&A line, there are always going to be some factors that are non-recurring that are adjustments to certain reserves. That's the line item that it appears in, and this quarter, part of that explanation is non-recurring accruals related to those matters.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein Research", "Turning away from the Durbin amendment stuff, can you give us an update on the latest status on the merchant litigation case in the Brooklyn court? And can you give us any thoughts on how to dimension the possibilities for a settlement and what forms the settlement might take?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, unfortunately, the answer is no. I can't answer any of those questions. Obviously, the litigation continues, and there are conversations. But beyond that, I really would be foolish to say anything else.", "Byron Pollitt", "If I could just add one comment, actually, to Julio's prior question. Julio, the G&A also is impacted by the addition of CyberSource. So literally, all the line items in the P&L are being impacted by the pickup of CyberSource expenses. So that's another important driver of that line.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bruce Harting, Barclays Capital.", "Bruce Harting - Barclays Capital", "I guess we agree with your position on the Durbin legislation and on unintended consequences, but in the event that the Fed rule stands as is and they extend the exclusivity issue to signature debit, what are the technology difficulties? Or what would you be lobbying to the Fed right now in argument of not extending to signature? And indeed, I mean, it looks like there's only two networks able to provide that, correct? So wouldn't that just solidify the strength of the oligopoly that they're worried about policing? And who pays the cost to change the cards? Would that be incurred by the banks? And how long would it take to implement that change? Would it take -- would that be something that could be turned around by the banks in terms of reissuing new cards with two networks within a month? Or is that a six-to-12-month issue? And is it true that the merchant acquirer decides on the routing anyway? And wouldn't they be incentivized to go with -- to stick with you, since many of the merchant acquirers are your customers currently and would want to get the discount?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, I mean you've asked a lot of extraordinarily good questions and therein lies the dilemma. I mean, everything you said is reasonably accurate. We are in a very good position, and regardless of what happens, I don't think you're going to see any kind of an overnight deterioration. And I think you're obviously going to see us doing everything that we can to be the network of choice, and I think that there are many compelling reasons that we can put forth that will help us secure that position. And whatever happens, we look forward to using our people and our assets, which we believe in this regard are second to none, to make sure that we come out ahead of the game.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Kissane, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Byron, can you give us a sense of what portion of your U.S. revenue is from issuers and what portion is from acquirers? Again, just on the U.S. side.", "Byron Pollitt", "Jim, for some time, it has been plus or minus, roughly equal, plus or minus. It has not materially changed when we first talked about that. I think it was about a year ago. It might be a bit more. If I were to round it, we would round it a bit more to the acquirer, but there's been no material change since we first voiced that ratio about a year ago.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Craig Maurer, CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I wanted to follow up on your discussion of Mobile. Considering we are likely to see the likes of Google and Apple come out in a big way supporting contactless payments this year, how do you expect or how do you envision re-terminalization to occur? Do you expect there to be subsidies to get merchants involved, who will likely be offering those subsidies? And will we see the tone of Visa's marketing in the U.S. change to support some of the issuers that are trying to roll this out?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, Visa is in support of chip technology and on a global basis. Timing of when it will occur and how it will occur is still somewhat questionable, particularly in the United States. I think that the current state of affairs between the Card Act and the Durbin amendment has stopped some issuers as it relates to whether they want to invest and how do they want to invest. I don't think that there's any magic wand that is going to automatically make a contactless chip terminals or contact chip terminals automatically appear in an overwhelming way in the United States. I think that that will indeed take some time, and I think most issuers and even merchants believe that to be the case. I'm not certain, but I actually think there are somewhat fewer contactless terminals today than there may have been a year ago. So we've got -- there are issues in that regard as it relates to standards, chip standards. There isn't one contactless chip standard around the world and so all of this has to be reconciled before it becomes -- we become a country, where people walk around with cell phones and just automatically walk into face-to-face merchants, swipe their cell phones on a contactless. That being said, there is an inextricable momentum to mobile technology and contactless chips that is beginning to occur, and it will manifest itself over some period of time. We are extraordinarily involved in those efforts, and things that we are doing in that regard will become apparent as each quarter goes on. And we're reasonably confident that we have invested the right time and effort and capital into taking our business in the appropriate direction.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Just model related, Byron, on that personnel color that you provided, so that delta year-over-year, is that something we should extrapolate for the remainder of the year across the quarters? And then you mentioned rebates kind of coming in within the same range you guys had articulated. That would suggest that the next three quarters' run rates are probably going to be higher than what we saw in the first quarter, obviously. Is there any kind of seasonality that we should expect within that trend?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes. So on the first one, with regards to personnel, as you readjust your models for that line item, it would make sense to look at the fourth quarter of last fiscal year recognizing that we integrated CyberSource and I think the last two months of the quarter. So you should see a beginning step-up in personnel expense the next quarter -- so the quarter just completed, that's reflective of what you should be thinking about going forward, recognizing that there's always going to be some degree of lumpiness in personnel as we make various accruals, but we would suggest keying more off the first quarter. As it relates to our word, our expression is client incentives. I think another company uses rebates. With regards to client incentives, this is -- as we've talked about historically, this is a category that tends to be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on when certain contracts are signed, when renewals are signed. And so rather than seasonality, let's use it's a bit lumpy, and therefore, we came in a bit lower than our full year guidance in the first quarter. Therefore, you should see some -- in future quarters, we would expect it to come in a bit higher to average out to somewhere between 16% and 16.5% on a full year basis.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a question on Rest of World credit volume. Nice pickup in the most recent data, so just wondering if you had anything to call out there, just what you see what's sort of driving that net solid growth rate.", "Byron Pollitt", "So on Rest of World credit volume, looking at it on a constant dollar basis, it has been pretty steady -- again, on a constant dollar basis, pretty steady double digits, mid-teen double digits through 2010, and January picked up a little bit, but that's -- no, the first quarter picked up a little bit. So it looks like very sustained positive momentum. Our transaction volume is picking up. Our processed transactions are picking up outside the United States, so that's encouraging. And the cross border travel outside the United States has remained very, very healthy. So with January, a pickup over the first quarter levels by a couple of points. So from that standpoint, the economic momentum for Rest of World appears very solid, very sustained, both from a domestic standpoint and from a cross border standpoint.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Bryan Keane, Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess just two questions. I guess first, do you have any indication from Washington that getting the Durbin amendment delayed is a realistic outcome? Meaning, is there some real legs behind this right now? And then secondly, just on mobile payment, how will the economics change with the new competitors getting involved like Apple, Nokia, Isis and others? Or do you think the economics of Visa, like they have in the physical world, will be the same in the mobile world?", "Joseph Saunders", "I can't predict what Congress is going to do. I can remind you that there is significant effort that is going on that is embraced by large banks, mid-sized banks, small banks, credit unions. I think that you will see some reaction from consumers, because in our opinion, consumers have been thrown under the bus in this legislation. And so in that regard, I would have to think that through some of the conversations we've had and because it is the right thing -- and I want to emphasize, it is the right thing. We're on the right side of this issue. I'd like to think that something will happen. I would like to think, as I said earlier, that it will take the form of a delay in the implementation of the legislation until the unintended consequences can be better assessed. But I can't promise you that. I can't tell you that I've had secret conversations with anybody and that this is a [indiscernible] (1:03:14), because none of those things would be true. So now that I've answered that, I forgot the second part of -- Mobile. That's an interesting question. But when you look at mobile technologies, as I said just a few minutes ago, I mean, it's coming or it's here. However, you want to define it. It makes it easier for people to shop. It opens up new avenues of things that may be purchased through your wallet, and there are a lot of technology companies that have significantly positive offerings and capabilities in this regard. Visa also has significant capability. We still have VisaNet. We still have a whole processing infrastructure. There are still 1.8 billion cardholders around the world, and we have been vigorously looking at and working on the technology. And we think we're going to be in a very good position as it relates to the evolution of mobile technology in the electronic payments business. I think that it will afford us some revenue opportunities that we currently don't have, and I think that will be a very positive thing. Will it change some of the other economics we have? I mean, it could. It could, but when we look at the overall landscape, we are comfortable that this is a positive thing for Visa and will be a positive thing going forward. And remember, we've talked to these other entities that you're referring to, and they do need some of the capabilities that we'd have, or they're either going to have to provide them themselves, or they're going to have to come to somebody like us to get them. And so there are compelling reasons for partnerships to occur. A significant -- even when you look at somebody like PayPal, let's not forget that a significant amount of their business is driven through Visa, MasterCard, and that isn't about to change in the near future. And I know that's not totally analogous to mobile technology, but I think that what Visa has put together over the years is very compelling as it relates to what it brings to the party from a speed or reliability or privacy and a security point of view. I don't think we're going to let that go.", "Jack Carsky", "Jose, we have time for a final question.", "Operator", "The final question does come from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just for Byron, the services yield went up pretty significantly, Q-to-Q. I think you alluded to a pricing change in the quarter. Does that account for the whole differential on the yield? And is it a sort of a sustainable yield level going forward?", "Byron Pollitt", "That is the primary driver, and that would be sustainable going forward.", "Jack Carsky", "All right.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet, and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph Saunders", "Thanks, Jack. And as always, thanks to all of you for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of solid financial performance posting net operating revenue of over $2.2 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. As has been the case for over a year now, these revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume, and Visa-processed transactions from across the globe. ", "Notably, 62% of our total revenue growth came from outside the United States, getting us progressively closer to our stated objective of having our business outside the United States represent more than 1/2 of our revenue by fiscal 2015. ", "Net income for the quarter were $881 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.23, a 28% increase over the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, we effectively repurchased an additional $630 million worth of shares nearly exhausting our $1 billion authorization first announced at the beginning of this fiscal year. ", "Given that, and recognizing our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, today, we're pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This brings our total amounts of repurchases in fiscal 2011 to $2.8 billion. Byron will provide some additional detail on the specifics of the activity. ", "Before covering some of the business highlights from the quarter, I'd like to first address the ongoing legislative dialogue in Washington in the industry's efforts to address the Durbin Bill. Reiterating what I said on last quarters call, since the introduction of the Durbin amendment, Visa has worked with the industry to help educate legislators on the unintended consequences of this piece of legislation. And our efforts are gaining increasing traction. ", "As you know, Senators Tester and Carter have introduced legislation calling for a delay in the study of the Durbin Bill. The Senators' efforts have generated support from a large, growing and diverse group of individuals and organizations who are concerned about the unintended, anticonsumer consequences of debit regulation. We believe strongly that Congress should examine what the real impact of this regulation will be on consumers, the financial institutions that serve them, the payment system and the economy as a whole. This would be the reasonable and rational course of action. To that end, we are hopeful that the Senate will consider Senators Tester and Corker's Bill in the very near future. ", "That said, no matter what happens with Durbin, we will continue to compete in and lead the U.S. electronic payments market, and be a growth company for years to come. ", "I'll now turn to Business Developments from the past quarter that underscore our focus on driving global revenue growth today, while also setting the stage for future growth through new and innovative ways to pay. As ever, our strong relationships with clients continue to help drive our success. In addition to delivering solid financial gains in the second fiscal quarter, we were successful in advancing our strategy of growing and protecting our core business through key wins and relationship renewals with financial institutions and merchants. ", "First, we grew our core issuance business with several important new deals. For example, in India, we've made significant strides in expanding our business with the State Bank of India. We signed a multiyear deal to issue Visa debit products across the SBI franchise, whereas until now the bank's business was entirely with our competitor. Nearly 500,000 Visa cards have been issued since March, and we expect several million to be issued within the first year of the program with significant runway beyond that. ", "This new win is in addition to the joint venture we already have in the works with SBI and Elavon to terminalize major metropolitan areas of the country. We also recently signed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with HSBC, covering most of our Latin America and Caribbean region that will considerably broaden our issuance with HSBC in this part of the world. ", "This builds upon the long-term issuing relationship we have had with HSBC globally for many years. And in the U.S., we expanded our credit program portfolio with a new 7-year program with U.S. Bank and Kroger, one of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., which will begin converting to Visa in September. ", "We also strengthened several relationships with longtime key issuing clients in the U.S. Most recently, we resigned Regions Bank to a multiyear credit debit agreement to include signature debit, interlink, and some processing services. Regions is a top 10 debit issuer in the U.S. and a longtime client of Visa. ", "We also continue to see good traction on the prepaid front in the U.S. with our state government programs. We recently initiated unemployment insurance programs in Connecticut with Chase, and in Florida, with Wells Fargo. On that subject, our unemployment programs with the Bank of America in New Jersey and California are ramping up at a very nice pace. Importantly though, we are seeing increasing use of these cards at the point of sale versus cash withdrawals at the ATM, as consumers get more comfortable with this form of prepaid product. ", "Beyond working with our financial institution and merchant clients to expand issuance and acceptance of our core products, we also continue to look ahead and develop new channels and form factors to diversify the utility of these products. ", "For instance in the mobile space, we just announced our realtime messaging service with our first client, the GAP. This service allows merchants to send realtime location-based discounts and promotions to consumers via text message. In this case, consumers can opt into the GAP Mobile for You program to receive GAP discounts that are triggered when they conduct a qualified Visa transaction, which they can choose to redeem at a GAP store while they are out shopping. GAP was the first national retailer to test and rollout realtime messaging and we have a strong pipeline of other retailers to follow. ", "This is an excellent example of a value-added service that supports merchants' desires to personalize the consumer shopping experience made possible by the realtime processing capabilities and unparalleled data from our Visa Net processing infrastructure. ", "Equally important is the legislation has not delayed, RTM along with other offerings such as CyberSource's enhanced decision manager, which I'll talk about in a moment, are the types of Visa value-added services that would incent merchants to route transactions over Visa Net. ", "In the area of person-to-person payments, we continue to make important strides in leveraging our network and significant card base to enable people to pay each other using Visa cards. Our recent announcement with CashEdge and Fiserv in the U.S. underscores one of the important ways we are accelerating growth in this area. Increasingly by working with partners like these, we have existing distribution channels, we can broaden the reach and ease of use of the prepayment programs of Visa products. ", "A recent example of one of these P2P programs overseas involves a service we recently launched in Russia and the Ukraine. We are working with Kiwi, Russia's largest payment kiosk operator, First Processing Bank in Russia, and PrivatBank, the Ukraine's largest bank. Together, we are enabling domestic transfers within Russia and with the cross-border functionality between Visa account holders in the U.K. and Russia. Over time, we will partner with additional entities to expand these programs globally. ", "On the eCommerce front, we closed the PlaySpan the acquisition on March 1. In the meantime, we have seen CyberSource's business continue to grow rapidly and gain increasing traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, CyberSource delivered 38% billable transaction growth and secured a number of new business wins with major merchants including IDS, America and Olympus America. I also want to point out one or more of the recent examples of the synergies we are finding with CyberSource that deliver tangible value to our global merchant base. ", "This quarter, we combined the strength of Visa and CyberSource's individual fraud detection capabilities to launch our first iteration of enhanced decision manager, which I mentioned earlier. By combining the risk force that CyberSource has historically provided to its merchants clients with data from the Visa Inc. advanced authorization service, we are delivering a unique and unparalleled view of transaction data that merchant clients recognize will serve them as a powerful new fraud detection mechanism for their business. ", "All of these advancements are important steps towards capturing the enormous opportunity we see ahead, with payments innovation fueling our business growth over the moderate to long term. All of us know the way people connect and transact across the globe is changing dramatically driven by 2 global forces. First, the continued secular shift from paper base to electronic payments that still largely occurs at the physical point of sale, and second, the widespread adoption of mobile and Internet technology. These forces our conversion, and consumers and merchants are looking for payment solutions that harness these technologies. To that end, we have been working hard to develop a Visa quality payment solution that brings reliability, security and convenience to mobile and eCommerce environments. ", "In our view, a globally viable payment solution must have 5 fundamental characteristics: convenience and simplicity, standardization, interoperability, global accessibility and security. None of the solutions we have seen from competitors is comprehensive enough because they don't address all of these criteria at once. Visa has long delivered solutions at the physical point of sale that passed this test and we are applying the same standard in the online and mobile arena. ", "Look for us to make an announcement of our global eCommerce and mobile strategy later this month. And now, over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth was broad based, with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 21% growth rate in rest of world. As Joe mentioned earlier, over 60% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue is now 45% of Visa's total. ", "Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of February and March both comped at 11%, which is the first time we have seen double-digit growth since the recession. We are clearly encouraged by this trend. Third call out relates to client incentives. Incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue was 16.7%, up from 15.3% in the first quarter. Taken together, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16% for the first half of the fiscal year, at the low end of our guidance.", "While we still expect client incentives to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% for fiscal 2011, if implementation of the Durbin amendment is not delayed beyond July, it is probable that we would see some upward pressure on this number as a result of potential actions we would take to mitigate volume loss with certain issuers and merchants. ", "Fourth call out relates to Durbin. Whether the legislation gets delayed or not, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and earnings per share growth of greater than 20%.", "Finally, it's worth noting that beginning with the second fiscal quarter, our 3 key revenue drivers are now growing at double-digit rates, while comping double-digit growth in the same quarter of the prior year. This is true both globally and for the U.S., indicating that the strength of the recovery is now more broad based. ", "Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for the December and March quarters, as well as more recent payment and transaction results for the entire month of April. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal year 2011. ", "Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 13%, a modest decline from the 15% growth we saw in the December quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the March quarter figures. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 12%, relatively flat from the December quarter. Rest of World payment volume on a constant dollar basis, grew at 15%, down 2 points from the 17% rate in the December quarter. ", "More recently, in the month of April, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 11%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the second quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth to be higher than the U.S.'s 11%. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the March quarter, down slightly from a 15% rate in the December quarter. There was notable drop off in inbound travel to Japan, Middle East and North Africa. In aggregate, these situations may have negatively impacted growth by about 50 basis points. In April, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 13%. ", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 13% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 15% growth rate we saw in the December quarter. In April, processed transactions posted growth of 12%. CyberSource billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion for the quarter, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. ", "We continue to expect strong results in this part of our business as eCommerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. ", "Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenue of $2.7 billion was up 16% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year, driven by a sustained economic recovery, previously enacted pricing changes and cross-border transaction growth. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 24% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. ", "Data processing revenue was $823 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transaction. As expected and discussed previously, data processing revenue growth has moderated due to the impact of key contract renewals 2 quarters ago, and by the prospective removal of certain offsetting Gateway pass-through revenue and expense. ", "International transaction revenue was up 14% to $624 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentive as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.7% and are running at 16% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Approximately 65% of the year-over-year dollar increase in incentives is due to payment volume growth in client portfolio, about another 25% of the increase is due to non-U.S. client renewals. ", "Total operating expense for the quarter was $862 million, up 3% from the prior year. Increases in personnel, professional fees and general and administrative expense were offset by lower marketing in the period. Additionally, and I'll continue to remind you of this for the next 2 quarters, recall that we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass through activity. ", "As a result, $55 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q2 fiscal year 2010 did not reoccur in Q2 fiscal year 2011. In Q2, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. For the remainder of the year, these changes in presentation will continue to be earnings neutral, and will affect revenue growth. ", "The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the second fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity and contributed a positive 2% increase compared to the same prior year period. While our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, please note that we expect to aggressively fund important long-term investments across our entire business. ", "Capital expenditures was $72 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Lastly, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. And we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04 for the full 2011 fiscal year. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investments of $6.6 billion. Of this total, $3 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the remaining 3 quarters with $2.7 billion uncommitted as of the end of the second quarter. ", "In terms of our ongoing buyback, at the end of the quarter, we announced the prefunding of the litigation escrow by $400 million to be funded with cash previously designated for our $1 billion share repurchase. This was executed at an average price of $73.81 per share. Additionally, we repurchased $230 million of our shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $70.53 per share. All told, we effectively repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $73.58. This leaves us with $64 million of open to buy under the original program. ", "At the end of the quarter, we had 704 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. And importantly, the A class now accounts for almost 75% of our outstanding shares. Management remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And through this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. ", "As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given the results to date, we are not making any adjustments at this time. With or without a Durbin delay, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Once the timing and content of the Reformed Act Regulations are clarified, we will determine whether any 2011 guidance requires adjustment, such as client incentives, and we will consider providing an early earnings outlook for fiscal 2012. ", "In summary, we expect Visa to remain a solid growth company for years to come. Our core businesses continue to grow at healthy rates, while we are aggressively investing in technologies and platforms that will extend our core payment and processing capabilities, thereby creating new sources of growth. ", "Finally, we expect to deliver this growth while driving significant free cash flow, which we will use to enhance shareholder returns through a continued dividend increases and share repurchases. ", "And with that, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.", "Bruce Harting - Barclays Capital", "With 60% of growth coming from Rest of World, I'm just trying to circle the next time you have an earnings announcement, hopefully, we'll know one way or another the outcome of the fed decision and whether it's stalled or not. But is it one way to look at it of $2.2 billion of net revenue this quarter, I figure about 10% given your previous numbers came from issuers at U.S. debit, so call that maybe $200 million. And in theory if that were reduced say, 20% just to pick a number or maybe worst case, or $40 million a quarter, the other $2 billion of revenue is growing faster as you said with 60% of revenue growth coming from Rest of World, particularly strong in credit given that credit is much larger Rest of the World than debit. Is it one way to look at it and say that, that other $2 billion of revenue not impacted by Durbin growing say, 15% would more than offset say, the $40 million decline and the $200 million of U.S. debit coming from issuers. Is that one way to try to size this in the second half if we get a worst case?", "Byron Pollitt", "Without confirming any of the numbers, I think the mindset that we are conveying and you're picking up is that with that 45% of our net revenue in the quarter is now coming from outside the U.S. That revenue this quarter, grew at 21%, twice what the growth rate is of the U.S. at '10. And we were particularly pleased to see that this is the fifth straight quarter of positive payment volume growth in U.S. credit. And so, within the U.S. portfolio, which is being outgrown by Rest of World, credit is beginning to take a stronger presence and thereby putting debit in a different financial perspective than it was say, 12 months ago. So I think that thesis is exactly what we were trying to convey on the call. Thank you for asking.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Joe, I guess I want to ask you, I guess you're teasing us a little bit here with the eCommerce mobile strategy announcement later this month, is there anyway you can elaborate on that further? And I guess, I'd also ask if you can update us on your willingness to work with I'll call it, non-bank partners in the U.S., names like Isis, which I believe is now opening things up outside of Discover?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, I can't really expand on the first point because as I suggested, we're going to make an announcement and we'll begin with something in the middle to the end of next week. And so, you're going to have to hold off for a few days or several days in that regard. As it relates to the second part of the question, obviously, one of the things that we're looking at is opening up new and different sources of revenue. And that would suggest that we'll be working with different types of entities and we have pretty much exquisitely worked with before. Having said that, I want to make perfectly clear, we're not going to do this at the expense of our primary customers and financial institutions.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "I want to address the 8 online in the quarter because all the calls that I'm getting post their releases is on this. And I know Byron, you went through the details. It was based on the accounting changes around extras and no Olympics this year and so forth. But just to set an apples-to-apples basis, what would the year-over-year EPS compare have been? And as a follow-on, you said that you will continually invest in growth initiatives with the margins of 62%. Does that mean they're not sustainable at current levels?", "Byron Pollitt", "So on the first one, I think what you're asking, Adam, on marketing is because we took the Visa extras out of the expense base going forward, does that have a P&L impact? Is that the question? Because the revenue came out equal to the expenses, so while marketing is down and it is down in part because of the removal of Extras and also because of timing, the full year impact of the change that we made with Visa Extras is income statement neutral. So no impact on EPS, and no impact on the full year guidance for marketing because when we guided, while marketing is down versus the same quarter last year, there's always, given the campaign that we have last year relative to the Olympics, you would naturally expect it to be down somewhat. So we are still fully consistent with the guidance that we gave earlier on marketing. And the adjustments we made for Extras no income statement impact. With regards to the margin at 62 for the quarter, that would be -- what you should take away is that we are increasingly investing in our products platforms to drive future growth. And the margin will simply be an outcome of the level of investment that we make and we continue to invest aggressively in that arena.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.", "Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I had a question as it pertains to watching inflation, gas prices and food. I wanted to know what really has been your experience, where in a certain I guess, friction points or price levels, which could impact your transaction growth relative to what you guys get from higher average ticket prices? And then, are you really concerned at current levels? Or would you be concerned if these levels, where kind of held up for a long period of time?", "Byron Pollitt", "This is Byron. Let me give you a few -- a little bit of factual perspective first. With regards -- let's talk about this in the context of the U.S. So for gas, historically, go back a year. At gas prices that we're roughly 30% less than they average, on average than they are today, we were running about 8% of total U.S. payment volume in the gas category. We refer to it as oil, in the oil category. In the month of April, that was just a little over 10% of U.S. payment volume, suggesting that the share had moved up about -- that's about a 25% increase in the share of U.S. payment volume. When you compare that to roughly based on our measures of 32% increase in the average price of gasoline, April versus about where we were a year ago, and you factor in that there is probably been some degree of consumption cutback given prices that are now posted in the $4-plus range. That is the immediate impact. We have not yet seen and it may be a bit early, we have not yet seen any specific call outs relative to trade outs on other spending categories, which may be in part due to the additional disposable income created by reductions in withholding tax and social security. So we're still trying to sort that out. Inevitably, there is probably going to be some friction. But at the moment, it's hard for us to identify it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Byron, if we operate under the assumption that indeed, Durbin is not delayed, and as you said, you would adjust incentives to maintain volume, should we think about that, first of all, I'm assuming what you're saying is you'd be above the high end of the 16.5% range you set. And second, would that effectively be a onetime event concentrated in the second half of '11 and then you'd go back to more normalized levels in the future? Or is that a structurally higher level of volumes to support incentives in your view?", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me deal with the first part of your question. We've delivered the first 6 months at 16% incentives as a percent of gross. And our guidance was 16% to 16.5%. That 16% to 16.5% guidance did assume that Durbin would not be delayed, that we would have some impact of Durbin before the end of the year and we provided for some degree of incentives in the event that, that were to happen. Without knowing the exact timing, without knowing exactly how the rules will be promulgated, without knowing the timing, the implementation timing associated with those rules, those are some pretty big wildcards with regards to the incentives that we may or may not be putting on the table this fiscal year. And therefore, we were drawing attention to the fact that we've got a year in the bag at 16, but there's some significant uncertainties still to go. But some of those uncertainties we're contemplated. So don't automatically assume that were it to be -- were it not to be delayed that we would necessarily be above that range. But where we end up is going to be a function of the timing and the exact wording of the rules. And I would say on the second, it's just hard to know with regards to how we would be deploying incentives today versus how we would do it under Durbin. The notion that incentives would be in play I think is a fair assumption. To what degree whether it be onetime, sustained. I think it will be -- once we understand better the environment ahead, we'll be much better able to opine on that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.", "David Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Guys, I was just wondering if the acceleration in credit growth is just all being driven by just consumer preferences as maybe their incomes arise et cetera? Or if there's some external push from the banks that are just starting to push credit over debit or just deemphasizing debit?", "Byron Pollitt", "Credit is typically much more discretionary in its use. And therefore, we have continued to see very strong debit growth, which is more nondiscretionary. As the economy recovers, our belief is that consumers in combination with more employment, become more willing to spend on the discretionary side. From what we can see, this is still concentrated in the high-income segment of the market, but driven by more discretionary spend and not coming at the expense of debit at this point.", "Operator", "Next question comes from David Hochstim, Buckingham Research.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Could you just give us maybe a better stance of how much deconversions affected the revenue and payments growth metrics this quarter, if we look at year-over-year comparisons this quarter versus the December quarter?", "Byron Pollitt", "We are -- we don't actually guide to or disclose what the actual impacts are. But it is a -- conversions are accretive for us through this fiscal year. And we can address that again with fiscal year '12 coming up when we talk about our guidance for that time period at the end of the year. We'll address conversions or deconversions at that point. But it should be accretive in each quarter for the balance of this fiscal year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citi.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc", "Joe, as you look at markets such as Asia, I mean there's clearly a very strong growth trajectory. I was curious on the headwind side, I mean, how do you feel about the competitive sort of landscape from a regional network perspective. We talked to some folks over there, and it seems like they are continuing to be pretty active?", "Joseph Saunders", "There's a lot of competitive activity that is different in Asia than in the United States. I mean there's China UnionPay, there's JCB, there's national payment system considerations. And so there's a lot going on. But we've been doing business around the world in a lengthy period of time, we've had people on the ground for decades in most of these countries. And the fact that these economies are emerging, and that electronic payment mechanisms are becoming more and more prevalent, we continue to have a huge opportunity almost everywhere in the world. Now I'm not being dismissive about the competition that we face. I mean obviously, there are areas of the world like China where we can't do business domestically. But I don't think that -- I think that our numbers would suggest to you that we're doing quite well in increasing our volumes in Asia and other parts of Latin America and other regions outside the United States. And so, I'm pretty bullish on where we'll be on the next few years in that regard.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Byron, maybe just sort of horn in a little bit on sort of the confidence to grow through Durbin, as we think about that longer term, is it the volume growth outside of the U.S., some of the mitigation strategies that you're talking about, what gives you guys the confidence? Or is it a combination of all of the above? You guys have the visibility on obviously, where the growth of the business is? But maybe anyway to sort of hone in on how you're think about the mitigation efforts themselves in terms of post-Durbin world et cetera?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, it would be -- this is Joe. It would be kind of silly for me to sit here and tell you exactly what we're going to do, because it clearly has something to do with the competition in the event that the rules change. But we certainly haven't been passive as it relates to understanding what the various implications and scenarios could be coming out of Durbin, whether it is delayed or it isn't delayed, what the final links from the fed would be. And so each of those cases, we have a different set of mitigation tactics that we would intend to use. I mean, obviously, we'll be doing some things that we would intend to do across the board regardless of how things developed. But our suggesting to you that we're comfortable, that we are going to be valuable and a company predicated on confidence that we have as it relates to what we do. If that's sufficiently vague, I'm sorry.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Maybe just a follow-up on that Joe, some of the things that would mitigate the effects on you wouldn't necessarily even be things that you would do, you might help them. But I was wondering about the idea of how much do you think of debit volume could be shifted either in more upscale customers up to credit or downscale customers to reloadable prepaid that would have kind of better economics for the issuer and for yourself as well? And would Visa be advantaged in that just because you tend to be partnered with the banks that have more robust credit card platforms like JPMorgan and BofA?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, yes. I mean I don't -- your logic is good and then also [indiscernible] space is a significant investment. I can't tell you, it's hard to judge what percentage of debit a volume could move up or down in the way that you're suggesting. But I don't certainly wouldn't be saying anything out of score or giving away any secrets if I suggested that there isn't a bank in the United States that isn't.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Yesterday, on First Data's earnings call, they have mentioned making significant investment in dynamic routing, whether that's premature or not depends on the Durbin delay or not. But I wanted to get your thoughts on the prospect of dynamic routing at the acquirer level and whether that would create a price war at the merchant level for debit?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, I mean, look, if this gets back into what are the mitigation tactics that we're going to use, and I understand what FDR thinks, and I understand that they're probably excited about the potential from their point of view. But frankly, I'm as excited about what we can do as they are about what they can do. And I'm really quite prepared to do what I need to do to compete with FDR. And at the risk of sounding -- let's not -- I'm not being flippant. I'm just -- I have a considerably hide the real confidence that we'll be just fine.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "It makes sense that you have your incentives outlook and your 2012 outlook essentially on hold until we get clarity on the fed's debit rules. But I'm wondering if you could give us a way to dimension the percentage of your U.S. revenues that are attached to clients, where your incentive agreement would need to be altered if the fed chooses either alternative A or alternative B, under the no network exclusivity provision. In other words, how much of your U.S. revenue mix is subject to incentive agreement modifications under the Durbin amendment, if in the long run, recognizing that Durbin's timing is very unknown?", "Byron Pollitt", "Rod, let me try and be helpful in putting some perspective with 2 observations. The first one of which, since we're not going to specifically talk about revenue in the context that you asked. We're already public that roughly a little over 50% of cards are issued in the U.S., where Interlink is exclusive on the bank, number one. In the debit, where Interlink is exclusive on the bank. Second, we have also said on a number of occasions that most of our contracts are set up with incentive arrangements that are tied to volume. And so, we will naturally at our impetus, want to revisit a number of those contracts to make sure that the incentives are structured in a way that makes sense given the legal environment that we will be under post-Durbin. I can't think of very many contracts at all that require us, because of the legislation to revisit the contract. We're going to want to in order to adjust the incentives so that it is a win-win for both us and the financial institution.", "Operator", "The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "So Byron, I'm just going to just improvise here in light of your response to that prior question which was intriguing. I just want to kind of reiterate what it is that you have addressed so far with regard to volume and et cetera. So you have said that you're 16.5% for this year had contemplated already some impact from Durbin, but the comment you just made suggested that perhaps volume and incentive would be in your interest to reduce in fiscal '12, should Durbin actually proceed? Am I misinterpreting that comment?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, you're misinterpreting. The incentive contracts that we have in place -- most of them are based on volume growth. And if the routing provisions go into place, where the financial institution potentially has less influence over the actual routing, we just have to look at the incentive provisions to make sure that they are reflective of the way the operating environment will conduct itself under legislation.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just wondering, I know it's small, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the PlaySpan acquisition. And we know the digital gaming category is displaying pretty explosive growth, so just any color on earliest thought and the strategy there as you layer in that platform? And then maybe as a quick follow-up, was there anything to call up in volumes, Byron, regarding the Easter shift?", "Byron Pollitt", "On the Easter shift, I would say there might be -- that one's hard for us. There might be a little noise in April, but we've got a pretty diversified portfolio. And so I don't think there's really a call out April and May. Early days on PlaySpan. Joe, do you want to, I think we just completed the acquisition. So we're fast integrating it and that may be...", "Joseph Saunders", "It will play a role beyond the gaming space and our strategic direction, which we will kind of an add for next week, so which will be much more apparent next week when we make an announcement.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Byron, can you comment on the expected timeframes for contract renewals with some of the maybe top 5 or maybe top 10 banks, and how much flexibility do you have in trying to modify some of those contract terms long before some of those contracts expire obviously, specifically we've been focusing on what you were saying regarding rebates et cetera?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, there are no top 5 contracts scheduled for renewal, I want to say, for a good 18 months or more. We do from time to time, when the opportunity is attractive, we will look at early renewals. But in terms of major contract renewals, at the end of last year, we pretty much cleared the decks and don't expect, we have no scheduled major renewals for at least another 18 months.", "Joseph Saunders", "And we just announced Regions today.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Joe, I know you're not going to give -- there's a lot more data coming next week. But I was hoping you might be able to give a little more color on -- like with the Visa announcement here leading us to tonight, for next week. Is it going to be something that is comprehensive with other joint ventures combined that is like live business? Is it something that's incremental? I mean maybe a little bit more color to help prepare us for next week?", "Joseph Saunders", "Well, I think that what I said earlier was that we recognize that as time moves on that mobile and eCommerce technology are going to consume a greater role in the electronic payments arena. And if we are going to remain as a viable player as we are today then we are going to have to be out in front as it relates to interoperability, simplicity, security and factors of that nature. So we have been paying attention to that, the acquisitions that we have made, that in the back of our mind. And we have a strategy both in the United States and other mature economies in a different strategy in different parts of the world, where there are emerging economies that depend more on technology. So it is kind of bringing that together, the way that we think about that. What we've done, what we have ready to induce and what we will be contemplating doing as time moves on. So our point of view, it's significant and from our point of view, it is -- we are better than any in the competition that we think we have to deal with, has been because our solution is a more complete solution than what we've seen in the market before. And so we've been reluctant to talk about it until we have put together and put together in an appropriate where we can tell you something positive and significant. And we can talk about how it all comes together. So that's where we are.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bill Carcache with Macquarie.", "Bill Carcache - Macquarie Research", "There has been some recent announcements that suggests that EMV is gaining traction in the U.S. Can you talk about whether you're seeing that and share your thoughts what that would mean for Visa?", "Joseph Saunders", "Chips, it is gaining traction and we've supported it. We've made an announcement several months ago as it related to our support globally. We didn't encourage it in the U.S. There have been a lot of things going on as you are probably aware like the [indiscernible] acting, the Durbin acting. Distracting to issuers in the United States. But for cards to be global, chips are going to play a role and we encourage moving the chip technology. We don't necessarily encourage them into pins and chips. We encourage moving to chips and other forms of identification or authentication than what exist, have existed here before. We don't believe that contact with chips would become something that is ubiquitous within the point of sale marketplace in the United States in the near future. We didn't know that there will be specific things to which it is applicable and for which it will be used, but it won't necessarily be widespread tomorrow or the next day or in 2012, 2013.", "Operator", "And the last question does come from Jim Kissane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Joe, do you think the economics with mobile would be better, worse, or the same, compared with plastic today, given that there's any carriers involved, handset manufacturers involved, potentially technology companies?", "Joseph Saunders", "I think we have a terrific opportunity in mobile technology. And I did mention answering one or the other questions, I believe that, we believe that not only, well, as it relates to the technology and just payments in general, we do believe that there are other sources of revenue that will be made available to us that are not now, that takes our CyberSource acquisition or PlaySpan acquisition, and other things what we've done and when we put it altogether we're pretty excited about the revenue that can come out of this in the future. Now let me caution you. I'm not talking about the spike in revenue in 2012. I mean this isn't something that happens overnight. It's something that evolves. But as I sit here and look at Visa and I look at our sources of revenue and our growth, I have to anticipate what is going to be fueling that growth 3 years from now, 4 years from now, not just what's going to happen next week. And so I think that what we're going to talk about next week, the way we're putting things together. And mobile technology in particular will be something that we'll be happy -- excited to be involved in as time moves on.", "Jack Carsky", "Well, that ends it.

Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal 2011 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph Saunders", "Thanks, Jack, and as always, thank you all for joining us today. Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net revenues of more than $2.3 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put option was $883 million, a 23% increase over last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26, a 29% increase over the third quarter of 2010. ", "Our performance over the past quarter reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and services offering, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. ", "Before turning to the business highlights, I'd like to update you on Visa's activities to adapt to the new United States regulatory environment. As stated during our update call on July 6, overall, I continue to expect the impact resulting from regulation to be dilutive but manageable with fiscal 2012, bearing the majority of the financial impact. It is important to appreciate that we were prepared for a wide range of outcomes. And with the Federal Reserve's final rules in hand, we have the clarity needed to execute on our strategies. We are now moving forward on multiple fronts and with a variety of new offerings for our clients. And today, I'd like to share with you, at a high level, a feel of our areas of focus. ", "We will offer additional detail in the coming quarters once we've had the opportunity to further discuss these strategies with our clients and partners. Regulation has dramatically altered the competitive environment in the United States and given merchants' broad discretion over how transactions will be routed. Recognizing this new dynamic, we are resetting our business approach and implementing a number of new strategies for all products. ", "Specifically for debit, we will continue to focus on maintaining Visa debit issuance through strong partnerships with our issuing clients, thereby positioning Visa to compete for as many transactions as possible. Equally important, we will ensure that Visa is positioned to compete for routing for merchants and acquirers by strengthening these important relationships. We are adapting Visa's business to deliver even more value to all participants in the value chain, while preserving our ability to grow and positioning Visa for continued leadership in the U.S.  ", "Our approach is based on multiple actions, which were incorporated into the guidance we provided earlier this month. I'm going to address 2 of them now. ", "First, we are modifying our economics in a way that we expect will result in a reduction in merchant cost in total and on the margin. The modifications include both fixed processing fees and a reduction in variable fees. We expect this will help us win routing decisions and maintain debit volume in the new environment. Specifically, Visa is implementing a new fixed acquirer fee called the network participation fee, which will apply to the acceptance of all Visa products and is based on both the size of the merchant and the number of merchant location. This fee will allow Visa to continue investing in our secure, reliable and interoperable global payments network, a long-standing area of strength for our organization. These attributes are cornerstones of Visa's brand promise, and it is critical that we make ongoing upgrades, innovations and enhancements. ", "In fact, Visa facilitates issuer-standing processing each day for more than 600,000 transactions, minimizing system disruption and ensuring more transactions get completed. In order to reduce fees in the aggregate, Visa will also lower our variable processing fees for all Visa debit products across all merchant segments. That combination of fixed and variable fees offers merchants an even greater incentive throughout more transactions over our network by providing them an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction costs and take advantage of economies of scale that are now more readily available to them. ", "As I said a few moments ago, our 2012 guidance, which incorporates the reductions we expect at Visa's debit, volumes and fees and the fees we charge also reflects our appreciation that regulation has changed the landscape in which we operate. ", "We recognized that we need to focus more than ever on delivering greater value to both issuers and merchants to win debit routing while continuing to grow our successful credit business. In that regard, we are taking multiple actions to ensure we are well-positioned to compete for both issuance and routing. We will extend the merchants of all sizes through direct negotiations and through acquirers the successful partnership programs we have historically offered issuers. We will also increase our engagement with merchant associations to achieve the same goal. Now a broad set of acquirers and merchants can receive incentives from Visa in exchange for routing commitments. ", "The second quarter element of our strategy focuses on additional investment and value-added services aimed at winning routing decisions. These include powerful merchant benchmark analytics, loyalty rewards programs and realtime mobile messaging to drive merchant sales growth. ", "For example, we continue to make progress on our realtime messaging program, including the Gap's recent decision to expand their existing program across more brands in their portfolio as well as new agreements with the Sports Authority and the Kangaroo Express, a leading convenience store operator in the Southeastern United States with more than 1,600 locations. ", "With these actions, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the United States and positioning Visa to grow from here. We are 100% prepared. We are fully engaged with our key stakeholders. We are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. ", "Taken together, our strategies will provide Visa with a strong foundation to adapt to the new landscape while also generating sufficient revenue to make the investments needed to drive forward the future of this industry. Of course, while the regulatory process generated headlines over the past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa's revenues are derived from products and geographies that are completely untouched by VisaNet. And in that regard, I'm pleased to say that Visa's employees maintained their focus and continued to advance our growth agenda. ", "In the U.S., we saw a continued strong performance in credit, posting Visa's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Of note, affluent credit posted particularly strong performance, growing 3 times faster than the overall credit category. Building on that success, we announced a multiyear agreement with United Continental Holdings to continue to issue co-branded Mileage Plus Visa cards. The recent merger of the United and Continental Airlines will result in the consolidation of their card portfolios under Mileage Plus, and the combined entity will begin exclusively issuing Mileage Plus Visa cards to all new customers beginning January 1, 2012. An important aspect of this major co-brand program is the proportionally larger number of affluent card carriers, and the greater cross-border volume usage associated with Mileage Plus Visa cards, all big benefits to Visa's overall growth. ", "Another key renewal was with Disney, with whom we have enjoyed an important co-branding and promotional relationship for many years. Outside of the U.S., International markets are increasingly important contributor of Visa's growth, increasing payment volume by 17%, which is driving approximately 60% of the company's overall revenue growth. In line with our strategic aspiration to grow Visa's business outside the U.S., we continue to make progress on our long-standing commitment to invest in key markets that show the greatest potential. ", "In critical markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, the GCC, Mexico and Sub Saharan Africa, we have tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase revenue growth over a 5-year horizon. We will continue to target additional countries for our investment in 2012 and beyond. ", "For example, in Russia, one of the fastest-growing countries globally, we are focused on delivering the core Visa product at value proposition and continuing to expand acceptance. We are investing to enhance mass credit and premium credit offerings and delivering products like prepaid and Visa Money Transfer to our Russian issuers and consumers. ", "In Brazil, where the acquiring landscape is changing, Visa is accelerating growth of processed transactions versus new acquirer relationships in renewing issuing partnerships. We continue to differentiate ourselves by delivering superior products across our core portfolio of credit, debit, small business and commercial solutions. ", "We also continue to advance our core product growth in India, establishing new or expanded agreements with several large clients, including the Life Insurance Corporation of India as well as the State Bank of India. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, we signed a multiyear agreement to support Visa debit products across the State Bank of India franchise. In just a few short months, over 1 million Visa debit cards have been issued as part of this program. ", "In Japan, we are accelerating growth by driving more sophisticated product offerings, such as co-brand programs with major issuers, merchants and commercial card programs that deliver solutions to more mature electronic payments environments. For example, we recently launched a debit program with Resona Bank, Japan's fourth largest financial institution. It's our first traditional debit program in that market, and we are hopeful that it will lead to similar programs with other clients, accelerating the migration towards electronic payments in Japan's traditionally cash-centric economy. And we are partnering with clients and governments and investing in long-term growth in developing markets in Africa, Latin America and South Asia to accelerate efforts to advance financial inclusion and ultimately grow domestic transaction growth. ", "On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. We continue to make progress on Visa's next-generation e-commerce and mobile payment solutions announced in May, including a focus on single-click and aliasing capabilities. We believe these elements of the Visa offering will help to differentiate and deliver value to the other NFC-only solutions recently announced. This remains a top priority for the organization, and we are moving full speed ahead towards broad commercial availability. ", "As we've said all along, Visa firmly believes an open approach is the key to success in mobile commerce. So in addition to building Visa's own capability, our strategy must also enable Visa payments on third-party platforms. That's why last week, we announced an agreement with Isis to join their consortium and we continue to engage in productive discussions with other potential partners. ", "Part of our efforts to make mobile a reality in emerging markets, we completed our acquisition of Fundamo, a leading mobile wallet software provider for emerging markets with over 40 programs in more than 25 countries. I can report that the integration is progressing well and we are now focused on building managed services for issuers and mobile operators around the Fundamo platform. Additionally, we are developing capabilities to overlay a virtual Visa prepaid account on the closed loop accounts managed by Fundamo and other wallet platforms. ", "Since our announcement, we have received substantial interest from issuers and mobile operators into Asia and Latin America. We are also taking action to further tap into the creativity and the expertise of the developer community, an increasingly critical participant in the creation and rollout of new payment technology. ", "Today, our existing developer center has more than 6,000 active developers using our tools and resources to build Visa payment functionality into websites for mobile applications, which in turn brings more merchants into the Visa network, ultimately driving transactions and payments growth. Additionally, through the center, Visa helps reduce e-commerce transaction risks, which means even more transactions are approved and flow through the network. This makes Visa a more attractive payment network partner. ", "To accelerate these efforts, we will launch our expanded Visa developer center in the current quarter, combining our existing PlaySpan and CyberSource developer activities into a single platform while also introducing direct connectivity to VisaNet for the first time. By connecting directly to VisaNet, we can offer our merchant partners and financial institution customers faster and easier access to Visa products and services, making them more competitive and ultimately driving incremental revenue growth. ", "On the e-commerce front, CyberSource's business continues to gain traction in the marketplace. During the quarter, billable transactions totaled just over $1 billion, a very strong 38% growth rate over the same period a year ago. We secured a number of new business wins with major merchants, including Twitter and Torno [ph]. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business, as e-commerce growth remains strong in the United States and internationally. ", "Finally, we continue to deliver on our long-standing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that our board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. This comes on the heels of completing our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in April. At approximately $77 per share, we retired 13.7 million shares in the quarter. This brings our repurchases in fiscal 2011, including escrow funding actions, to $2.8 billion. ", "In conclusion, as we reorient the U.S. debit business in the wake of the new regulations, we will simultaneously pursue our growth strategies both at home and abroad. Our commitment to our clients, new product rollouts and ongoing innovation combine to make Visa's value proposition more compelling than ever. And we are prepared to use our comprehensive array of products and functionalities to win in the marketplace. Visa remains a strong, globally-oriented growth company as we move ahead. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth was once again broad based with solid 9% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Over 62% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means the non-U.S. revenue is now 44% of Visa's total, up from 41% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. ", "Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 6 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of May and June comped at 8% and 12%, respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. We continue to be encouraged by this trend. ", "Third, incentives for the quarter as a percent of growth revenue was 16.2%, down from 16.7% in the second quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, incentives as a percent of gross revenue was 16.1%, in line with the lower end of our guidance. However, as we stated on our update call on July 6, we expect client incentives for the full fiscal year to be at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range based on the pacing of our contract pipeline and potential Q4 partnership contract that provide merchant incentives aimed at further encouraging Visa routing preference. ", "Fourth, as first discussed back in January, we sold our 10% stake in Visa Vale, a Brazilian prepaid issuer. Though we expect to book the gain as investment income in our second quarter, we actually recorded a gain in Q3 once we received the necessary Brazilian regulatory approval. The net benefit to Visa in the quarter was $85 million pretax and $44 million after tax. ", "Finally, as we did in the fourth fiscal quarter last year, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, which had a positive noncash impact to our earnings this quarter. The $122 million decrease in the value of the option is nontaxable, is reported in other income and is solely due to decline in Visa's TE ratio relative to historical level. It does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise the put. The put option is now valued on our balance sheet at $145 million. Eliminating this impact provides a cleaner picture of our operating performance, and yields an adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter. ", "Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the March and June quarters, as well as the results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. ", "Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollar was 13%, relatively flat from the March quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the June quarter. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 10%, a slight decrease from the 12% growth we saw in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 17%, up 2 points from the 15% growth rate in the March quarter. More recently, through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 10%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the third quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth to be higher. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the June quarter, up slightly from a 13% rate in the March quarter. We have seen some rebound in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa, but it is still too early to gauge the longer-term trends. Through July 21, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 18%. ", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the year ago period and modestly behind the 13% growth rate we saw in the March quarter. Through July 21, processed transactions posted growth of 10%. ", "Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenue of $2.8 billion was up 14% from the similar period in 2010. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the U.S., continued recovery in the U.S. economy, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the March quarter and the impact of pricing adjustments. Data processing revenue was $886 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions. ", "International transaction revenue was up 15% to $652 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes during the period. As I mentioned, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue came in at 16.2% and are running at 16.1% fiscal year-to-date, on track with expectations. Total operating expense for the quarter is $977 million, up 10% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were included in Q3 of the prior year. While marketing expense was up, approximately $70 million on a sequential quarter basis, this was due to the timing of planned campaign and is consistent with our full year guidance of less than $900 million. ", "In the U.S., we have continued to rightsize our spend, and refine our marketing focus to put greater investment toward digital media. We have also focused on marketing efforts on driving greater cross-border transaction growth. As a reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentations related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activity. Consistent with this announcement, $52 million of revenue and expense, which was booked in Q3 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q3 fiscal year 2011. In Q3, this represented 3 percentage points of revenue growth. ", "The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the third fiscal quarter was moderated by our hedging activity, and contributed 2 percentage points of growth. Our operating margin for the quarter was 58%, on target with our expectation for the full year. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter and now total $236 million year-to-date. ", "Given the pace of our investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives, we now expect our full year 2011 capital spending to be moderately above $300 million. ", "On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. For the full year 2011, we anticipate a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.04. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.01 for the third quarter. Full year EPS dilution is also expected to be $0.01. Finally, our recorded tax rate for the period was 35%, including the favorable impact from the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe consumption. Adjusting to exclude the put impact, the tax rate would have been 38%. On an as adjusted basis, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with our guidance. ", "As we announced on July 6, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board in April. During the quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to repurchase 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Year-to-date, Visa has spent $2.8 billion to effectively repurchase 37.8 million shares at an average price of $74.12. At the end of the quarter, we had 691 million shares outstanding on an as converted basis. ", "Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Bill mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion repurchase plan through July 20, 2012, which we will execute at prices we feel are attractive, relative to the long-term value of Visa. ", "As to guidance, for the balance of 2011, given results to date, and to reiterate what we told you on the July 6 call, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 11% to 15% range and EPS growth of better than 20%. Client incentives are expected to come in at the top end of the 16% to 16.5% range. And we are now expecting capital expenditures to be moderately above $300 million for the year, up from our prior range of $250 million to $275 million. ", "Our net revenue outlook for 2012 stands at high single to low double-digit growth, while earnings per share growth is expected to be at the mid- to high teens range. We will have additional guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 when we report our fourth quarter earning in October. ", "And with that, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just wanted to ask a question on the network participation fee, and thanks for the disclosures around some of your post-Durbin strategies there. Can you talk a little bit about that network participation fee in the context of some of the what sounded like are fee reductions from merchants and merchant acquirers? Just trying to understand from the Visa point of view how do you envision all that netting out on the merchants/acquiring side of your business?", "Joseph Saunders", "I think that our intention is clear, and that is to affect this change in our infrastructure while at the same time reducing fees to all merchants in every category. So the variable fee reductions are obviously an offset to fixed fee. If you look at our 2012 guidance, it presumes that there will be a deterioration in our debit card revenues for the year. We said that 2012 will be the low point. So that is the net result. The net result is that we won't do as well as we have here for in the debit card business at least in 2012. Hopefully, we can grow off of what we do in 2012 to 2013. But what we have done is, in our opinion, consistent with helping to ensure that Visa will be successful in the long run, and done within the spirit, and the intention of the regulation.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on the expense lines on a go forward basis. The personnel and the admin lines are fairly elevated. I was just wondering, is that the run rate to consider on a go forward basis? And also, just the card service fee margin, that seem a little lighter for this quarter sequentially relevant to past quarter, so I was hoping for some color there.", "Byron Pollitt", "On the personnel, in particular, the expense line items, no, that would -- at least on a percentage increase, that is not the run rate. So in the personnel line in particular, a little over 55% of the year-over-year increase is due to the personnel costs associated with CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, none of which were in Q3 of the prior year. So we're -- we will have a lapping for one more quarter for CyberSource, a few more quarters for the other 2. And we will give more color on the run rate with regards to expenses in the context of our margin, operating margin, at the Q4 earnings call. No real call outs on the service fee. We were pretty pleased with the yields, which held pretty firm for -- sequentially over the 2 quarters. So from that vantage point, no call outs.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc", "Joe, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit on the new debit pricing strategy, how the issuers might be thinking about that just given sort of the issuers' fee that you try to balance between the merchant acquirers and the issuers. And also, does that impact your ability to raise pricing in the future?", "Joseph Saunders", "I don't think that anything that we've done is inconsistent with our commitment to our current clients. In fact, most of what we've done and the restructuring that we've done is to ensure that we can continue to serve them and we can continue to help them run profitable businesses. I think what we've done also reflects our focus on making sure that everyone in the value chain has higher expectations of what they can expect in the future and that that helps regenerate the whole, at least from a debit card point of view, it helps sustain and regenerate the whole process of electronic payments continuing to move forward. I -- what -- there was a second part of the question...", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc", "Pricing?", "Joseph Saunders", "Oh, it doesn't constrain our ability to price. I don't think that we have done anything that constraints our ability to take actions in the future that we deem to be appropriate. I think the key word here is deem to be appropriate. And right now, we don't have any intention of raising any prices in the United States. I think that we're in the position that we're comfortable with, and that's the way we're going to look at it going forward for the time being.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I was hoping you could help us understand a little more the magnitude of change between the former pricing structure in debit and what's coming perhaps in the context of the 20% of revenue, 20% plus of revenue, that you've discussed as being generated from U.S. debit. Now I'll totally shift the topic. This morning, Cielo down Brazil held their conference call. They discussed that in a very brief time. LOs are already issued over 0.25 million cards, and that growth rate is accelerating. And I'm curious, if you take into account that the bank's pushing LO or mainly Visa issuers, are you seeing any impact to your growth rate of cards enforced down in Brazil?", "Byron Pollitt", "So Byron. Let me respond to both questions. With regards to a deeper description of the impact on the 20%, I think the way we've chosen to respond to that for now is related to what we described on our last call that in preparing for a new post-Durbin environment, there are a number of ways this can play out competitively. We have run a variety of scenarios. We have used those to inform the revenue range we gave to you all at the July 6 call. And I think you all recognize that there's a lot of market reaction here yet to unfold. Strategies need to play out before we can be more descriptive about these impacts. And as they do, we will update appropriately. Having said that, we do believe that the primary impact of the Durbin legislation will be felt in 2012, and we would expect to regain some revenue growth momentum in this arena in 2013. With regards to Cielo, it was contemplated all along that Cielo would be entering in this market. It is a lower income profile, lower spend-oriented market segment, and that's a segment very different from the one that we currently occupy. And so from that vantage point, we're -- we feel that the enormous growth we're experiencing in Brazil will continue and the developments we're seeing today are not unexpected.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Glenn Fodor, Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley", "Regarding your comments on the July 6 call, and this call as well on, that net revenue growth in fiscal '13 can regain momentum. This is a very important nuance for investors in the street. I was wondering if you can provide us with a little roadmap of how you see that occurring. I mean, I appreciate the color you gave today on Russia, Brazil and India, but those are going to take some time. So where is the fiscal '13 reacceleration going to come from? And then given that margins are pretty healthy already, could we still expect the same spread between revenue and earnings growth and why?", "Byron Pollitt", "Maybe the best way to respond to that, again, I'm going to elevate a little bit and describe some of the high-level baseline assumptions that we -- that informed the 2012 guidance, recognizing that on the fourth quarter earnings call, that is typically when we would provide more metrics to describe '12, and we'll see about '13. So in '12, we are projecting a global payment volume growth off of current trends adjusted for the investments we are making related to our country acceleration strategies. In U.S. debit, in particular, we do expect, as Joe mentioned, a decrease in yield. We expect to lose some routing, weighted more to PIN. We expect some volume shift from Signature to PIN. We expect much of that to play out in '12, therefore becoming part of our base in '12. And so from a revenue standpoint, by the time we run into 2013, we are benefiting from strong growth outside the United States that is accelerated, based on investments we are making in a number of key markets, to amplify the growth in those markets, and with post-Durbin impacts substantially embedded in the 2012 base, with our strategies in place and gaining more traction with each passing quarter. That is the underpinning of why we would expect to see revenue begin regaining momentum in '13.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "So first, a quick clarification and then I guess an easy question. U.S. guys debit payment volume growth decelerated by a couple of points from March to June. And I guess I'm wondering if Durbin potentially had a disrupted impact at all in your opinion on the debit volume growth. And then the meatier question is really about how do you expect your debit competitors might react to the altered debit pricing structure that you're rolling out? It seems desirable to avoid price-based competition, but it seems price-based competition is now somewhat of a certainty given that the other competitors are likely to respond to your altered structure. So do you expect the other networks to be more aggressive on pricing? And to the extent that they are, are you prepared to do something with your financials to try to buffer the impact, such as cutting advertising expenses, or something along those lines? Can you just give us an idea, because I know you run multiple scenarios on how competitors might react. But if those worser scenarios play out, where pricing competition gets more aggressive on a more aggressive side, you have a kind of a plan b to buffer the impact.", "Byron Pollitt", "So I'll take the first one. So Rod, with regards to the deceleration in debit, which you will also see in the -- that is also the explanation for why processed -- Visa processed transactions dipped a bit in the quarter. What you're seeing is the tail -- the runoff, so to speak, of the Chase/WaMu Conversion and the initial ramp up of the SunTrust change. And the combination of those 2 completely explain the drop in growth rate down to -- the dropping growth rate on Visa processed transaction. So that's the answer to the first question. Joe?", "Joseph Saunders", "And the -- well, the answer to the second question is, yes. We thought very clearly and gone very deeply into what our notions about what our competition would do. We think we have put ourselves in a position where we are more than capable of responding. We have no intention, nor do we think we have to start a race to the bottom. We do have contingency plans. We are very confident in the guidance that we gave you for 2012. And if you can remember, we withheld giving specific guidance on 2012 for quite some time. And we didn't actually say anything until after the Feb regulations came up, so that we could match what the rules said to what our plans were. We've done that. We're confident we're going to get where we said -- where we say we are going to go. I just would add to what Byron said earlier. He explained to you why 2013 might go up. I will also tell you that I think that 2012 is an extraordinarily achievable objective.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I had a couple of quick clarifications tuned in on each question I had as well. Just on the fixed fee versus lower variable fee strategy. I just want to make sure, is this just for debit? Or is it also for other Visa products? And also, just the impact on the P&L, does this -- I'm just trying to reconcile the strategy versus, Byron, the guidance you talked about the fourth quarter and the incentives picking up to win routing decisions. Is that one and the same? Or are they 2 different strategies? And then my primary question was just around the International volume that did accelerate. It looks like, and yes, it did accelerate in every region. So how much of that acceleration is from new programs being launched versus just a pickup in underlying same-store growth? Or is same-store secular growth obviously a lot of focus on the macro today?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, so with -- on the last one, it is same-store growth without question. That's the accelerator; fixed fee, all products and the 2 different strategies. So when we talked about entering into some additional merchant partnerships, trading incentives for routing preference, that is a different strategy. It's all contemplated in the guidance that we've given you for '12. But it's 2 different strategies with the network participation fee and the introduction of lower variable transaction cost being a separate pricing strategy, all contained within the guidance we gave for 2012 .", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Kissane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just another question on the network participation. Do you have a sense on what portion Visa will directly negotiate with merchants and what portion will be negotiated by the acquirers? And will merchants be able to opt out if they don't want to go along with the program and stick with the old variable structure?", "Joseph Saunders", "I'll leave the financials to Byron, but as it relates to an opt out, they can opt out if they don't want to accept Visa cards.", "Byron Pollitt", "And yes, we do. It is -- we have a sense as to the proportions. That's part of the scenarios that we have run. For competitive reasons, of course, you wouldn't expect us to be very specific on the call, so I will honor that expectation and not be.", "Joseph Saunders", "Yes. And let me go back and just remind everyone that this fixed fee that you're talking about is not a fee that sits on top of what merchants are paying. It is part of what we consider to be a reduction in the fees that merchants will pay.", "Byron Pollitt", "And I...", "Joseph Saunders", "I think that's extraordinarily important because to mischaracterize it would be a mistake and a disservice.", "Byron Pollitt", "And I would add, Jim, that the -- when Joe said earlier the strategies in part intended to honor kind of the spirit of the new regs, this will allow merchants to begin realizing more economies of scale on the incremental transactions as they grow their volumes. And we thought that that was an important design element of the pricing structure going forward. And so the notion of introducing a fixed component, having a lower variable and then allowing the variable to be the one in play as merchants grow their volume honors one of the objectives of this regulation.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Byron, just a clarification. Just a second ago, you said that this would apply to all products. Did you mean credit and debit products? Or did you just mean all debit products?", "Byron Pollitt", "No, all products. So the fee -- to pay the fee is -- makes you eligible to use -- to accept credit, debit, prepaid, all Visa products.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Okay, great. And just out of curiosity, in the rollout of India, you talked about 1 million debit cards being issued. I'm just curious on form factor there in terms of choice. Why not having gone to something more like mobile or some alternative technology, I guess, relative to classic at this point?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, there's some history there in the Indian market. We are absolutely going to mobile in India. But there initially, we are solving for cards that are PIN-enabled and that have standardized protocols that will allow broad-based acceptance and it addresses some historical issues in the India market. But this is in no way a substitute for mobile, which we view as a very important form factor to penetrate the vast majority of locations in India since it is very unlikely they would ever be able to support the fiber-optic infrastructure that more developed countries have developed overtime.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Robert Dodd, Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Dodd - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Just again seeking on the NCSA, how confident are you in your reporting ability to track the number of locations? If we look at the PCI DSS data you've given us in the past, the number of Tier 1 merchants that you disclosed has always been something of an estimate. I mean, so is there going to be a -- necessitate a change in recording from acquirers or anything like that for you to be able to extract the number of locations to appropriately levy the fee?", "Byron Pollitt", "The short answer is, yes, but we have researched this significantly, understand what the changes would be, have solutions to make those happen and are comfortable that this can be done in a relatively straightforward way within the timeframe contemplated.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tim Willi with wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Just a question on sort of thinking about routing preference and minimizing some, I believe, end market share.  To what degree do you think that the market share you currently possess and maybe the touch points of data and scale between the Signature business and Interlink affords you a competitive advantage around cost or the data and value that you've talked about in terms of building additional products versus what might be at the disposal of the competition if they decide to employ the same type of strategy?", "Byron Pollitt", "So I don't think there's any question. With our installed base, we have a highly, highly competitive cost position. With the data that we process, we are very well-positioned in order to add value-added services. And with regards to routing preference, given our market position, we have assumed, as I said earlier in our guidance, that some of the volume is at risk. It's contained in our guidance, more PIN and Signature, and that there is -- and our guidance assumes that there would be some conversion of Signature to PIN. So our guidance is based on those assumptions. Having said that, we feel very well-positioned to compete for transactions. The one change in the environment that we are sensitive to is that 2 unaffiliated networks need to be on those cards. And a meaningful number of our cards today are Visa branded on the front, Interlink on the back. And so we are mindful of that situation, mindful that we will -- that puts us in a different competitive position in the post-Durbin world. And those -- these -- that is the set of circumstances our strategies are aimed to address.", "Joseph Saunders", "In general, we think that our clients', that our infrastructure, that our recent announcements on e-commerce and the wallet capabilities that we're developing among a number of other things put us in a very, very, very strong position, which is not to say that there won't be competition and it's not to say that we're not mindful of what other people can do. We think that we have the largest market share because we have executed better than anyone else. I think that we have shown an ability to operate in front of the market. I don't see any reason why that should change. We will be diligent in that regard, and we will be mindful of the competition. And we have thought long and hard about all of that in delivering our guidance.", "Operator", "The last question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "I was wondering, are you planning to offer a new pricing structure and network participation fee in any markets outside the U.S. at this point?", "Joseph Saunders", "Not at this point.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And then could you just clarify 2 things? One, what the impact of gasoline prices was on spending in the last quarter and through July; and then just on the United agreement, what happens to the existing Continental cards when they expire? Or after the merger, what happens when somebody grabs a Continental card with another brand on it?", "Joseph Saunders", "We've asked -- you've asked a number of -- do you want to answer the gasoline one, Byron?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, well, the gasoline -- well, actually, we can get back to you on the actual impacts. We do have a phenomena that, when looking at the payment value -- payment volume trends, that once pricing gets much above, I think $3 approaching $4 a gallon, you begin seeing a switch from debit to credit. And so we're starting to see some of that, and some of that switch may come back the other way if prices drop. But largely, what we're seeing is a somewhat higher percentage on credit and debit to gasoline with no immediate trade out on other expenditures that's particularly noticeable. So that's it on gasoline, and...", "Joseph Saunders", "It does not, in aggregate, add at least significant amount to our growth.", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, and we've made no explicit assumptions with regards to the impact of gasoline plus or minus in next year's -- with regards to next year's guidance. On United Continental, all new cards under the new plan will be issued Visa. And then the existing cards -- well, the way that we articulate this is the deal is focused on the new issuance. And we get 100% of the new issuance given the effective date of the contract going forward.", "Joseph Saunders", "Cards outstanding will be reissued as they are -- must a consumer, of course.", "Jack Carsky", "All right. Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has nay follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This call has concluded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.'s fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings conference call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. ", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call. ", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and as a result of a variety of factors, actual results could differ materially from such statements.

For historical non-GAAP but pro forma-related financial information disclosed on this call, related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's earnings press release. This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you, all, for joining us today. Visa closed out fiscal 2011 with a solid fourth quarter delivering net operating revenues of $2.4 billion on a 13% increase over the same period last year. ", "Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.27, an increase of 34% on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, our adjusted figures exclude the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in the prior year.", "Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by strong payments volume growth around the globe, strong cross-border activity and continued recovery in credit spend worldwide. Net operating revenue growth for the quarter was impacted in part by a strategic decision to increase client incentives, as Visa aggressively pursued routing decisions from U.S. merchants and acquirers. These deals, most of which are onetime in nature, were the primary reason we modestly exceeded our annual incentive guidance of 16.5%.", "Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue was a record $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over 2010. Adjusted net income for the full year was $3.5 billion, a 22% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $4.99, 28% ahead of last year. ", "While Byron will get into more specifics on fiscal 2012, we are continuing to commit to our guidance provided in July of high-single to low double-digit revenue growth and mid to high-teens earnings per share growth. This takes into account only modest of global economic growth as well as anticipated industry reaction to the debit regulation.", "Given our outlook for continued growth, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, Visa repurchased $423 million worth of our stock at an average price of $80.87. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion, bringing our current repurchase authorization to almost $1.6 billion. And as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 47% over last year's rate to $0.88 per share on an annualized basis.", "Visa is fundamentally committed to driving growth by expanding our core debit, credit, prepaid and commercial businesses, which offer tremendous potential to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth and to deliver greater value to our financial institution and merchant clients. The goal is to grow the number of users, acceptance locations and ways to use Visa products.", "All of our priorities and investments focus on expanding that core well into the future. This includes applying both the businesses we've recently acquired, which are generating revenue growth today as discrete entities, as well as the innovative technologies we're developing in-house.", "Importantly, our core business is performing well today. Worldwide Visa delivered strong growth in the September quarter, with credit and debit payment volumes growing 14% and 13%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 15%. ", "As I review highlights for the quarter, let's first turn our attention to the United States. To help drive future growth, Visa finalized several deals with financial institutions over the past quarter. These include an extension of our long-term credit and debit issuance agreement with PNC Bank and long-term brand agreements with the Independent Community Bankers Association and card services for credit unions. In all cases, I firmly believe Visa's extensive industry expertise and experience were critical differentiating factors that helped secure these important wins.", "We also continue to win important co-brand deals with valued partners. This includes a new agreement with Williams-Sonoma, as well as the Marathon Oil co-brand mandate, which is a conversion from one of our largest competitors. These build on our momentum from the United Continental Holdings agreements announced last quarter.", "On the acceptance front, our ongoing strategic initiative to expand merchant acceptance is yielding important benefits. For the 12 months ended June 30, the most recent date we have available, Visa expanded U.S. acceptance by 400,000 merchant acceptance locations. And now, we are building on that. Beginning next month, Neiman Marcus will accept Visa in all of their stores, building upon their long-standing acceptance of Visa products online.", "Of course, we are moving forward on several fronts to implement our evolving debit strategies for the newly regulated U.S. market. These activities are progressing well and quickly, as we address the needs of both merchants and issuers. Our first set of activities focuses on winning merchant preference. ", "As a reminder, U.S. debit revenue impacted by the regulation contributes approximately 20% of Visa's total revenue today. Of that, signature debit contributes more than 75% of the U.S. debit revenue, and we are confident in our ability to retain the overwhelming majority of that as we move forward in the newly regulated environment.", "However, to address the pockets of debit revenue at risk as a result of the regulation, particularly revenues related to PIN debit, we are moving forward quickly with a program to incent routing decisions. In fact, between the start of the fourth quarter today, Visa completed dozens of merchant deals and executed contracts with a handful of our largest acquirers. ", "As I noted, by expanding our incentive program to the merchant community, we increased our client incentive sign for the most recent quarter. Byron will provide additional context, but I want it to be clear that I view these merchant incentive agreements as a critical aspect of Visa's business-building strategy in this environment. These are investments that create strong and productive relationships with our merchant client. ", "We're also moving forward with our modified debit economics, including the implementation of our network participation fee and the reduction of variable acquiring fees on debt, Visa debit and Interlink. As stated last quarter, we believe this offers merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per-unit transaction costs.", "As for details, we anticipate providing the specific pricing information to merchants and acquirers in January, which will go into effect on April 1. As a result, we will begin to recognize the related revenue impact in our fiscal third quarter of 2012. ", "At the same time, we are intensely focused on maintaining and expanding debit issuance through a strong partnerships with financial institution client. I've been clear since the Fed debit rules were finalized, the new legal requirements will likely result in a portion of transactions being moved away from Interlink as issuers take action to comply with the regulation. Specifically, in limited cases, this may very well result in the removal of Interlink from the card and migration to a competing network. These changes to the market are incorporated in our guidance.", "A key part of our strategy positions Visa to compete for every transaction on a Visa-branded debit card. To that end, earlier this year, we reminded clients that Visa check cards are enabled for PIN authentication. While merchant acquirers have historically used signature authentication for check cards, in the overwhelming majority of circumstances, Visa is fully capable of facilitating both signature and PIN debit transactions over one network, VisaNet. This is an important competitive advantage and differentiator in the new environment.", "Bottom line. As a long-term leader in debit, I'm confident Visa offers issuers a differentiated suite of debit products, a robust processing platform and economics that will help clients optimize their growth.", "Turning our attention outside the United States, we are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international markets by 2015. In fact, our international businesses grew 19% in the fourth quarter, driving 65% of Visa's overall revenue growth. ", "Each market is distinct and requires a unique approach to drive local growth. But much like the United States, the overwhelming majority of near-term revenue growth will come from expanding Visa's core businesses, including affluent credit, debit and processing.", "For one example, let's turn our attention to Latin America, where our core fundamentals are incredibly strong, and Visa has increased share in each of the past 5 years, that is, bulk share versus cash and checks and share versus our traditional network competition. ", "And we are building on that momentum. In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.", "In Brazil, we strengthened our partnership with Banco Rendimento to provide Visa processing services on prepaid products in the country. We are also engaged in productive discussions with other Brazilian clients and hope to soon announce some important transactions. ", "Our Asia Pacific region also continues to deliver very strong growth, with payments volume growing by 17% for the most recent quarter. And to drive future growth in the region, we signed several important agreements with key clients. ", "For example, in Australia, we secured an important agreement with Westpac Banking Group for expanded prepaid processing services. On the merchant front, we established acceptance for Visa prepaid products at Woolworths Group, the largest retailer in Australia, a critical step towards bringing prepaid into the financial mainstream in that country.", "Lastly, let's talk about innovation. We are aggressively stepping up investment in new technologies that will increase transactions on our core business platforms and add incremental value to the merchant community and create a new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients. As technology and thus the physical and digital shopping worlds converge, Visa is building its platforms in anticipation of a broad global adoption of next-generation payment technologies, including e-commerce mobile payments and information products. ", "Over the past 18 months, we've enhanced our position by assembling what we believe are the best assets in the business, including CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Each of these are discrete businesses driving revenue growth today and arm Visa with best-in-class technology and capabilities to quickly bring emerging products to market. Combined with Visa technology, global reach and proven reliability and security, these new assets will enable Visa to capture significant new revenue opportunities by providing the backbone for our next-generation offerings in the U.S. and globally. ", "When it comes to next-generation products, everyone is talking digital wallets. As a reminder, you don't transact with a wallet, whether it's leather or digital. You transact with what's stored in that wallet. And we have spent decades successfully placing nearly 2 billion Visa cards in cardholders' wallets.", "And today, when most people talk about digital wallets, they're talking about NFC payment on a mobile phone, and in that regard, no company is doing more than Visa to set the stage for broad adoption. Visa's suite of wallet solutions include Click-to-buy, touch to buy and tap to buy, which embrace e-commerce transactions, mobile commerce transactions and transactions at the physical point-of-sale using NFC chips. Our top priority is making the act of purchasing online or on-a-mobile device as convenient as when you use your plastic cards, benefiting both consumers and merchants. ", "Today, 46% of all e-commerce transactions are conducted with a Visa product, and I'm confident Visa is positioned for continued leadership in this category. To that end, we will soon begin rolling out a superior and simple online shopping experience through a Click-to-buy payment capability, which will be available on mobile devices and at home on your computer. ", "Our Click-to-buy and touch to buy functionality includes aliasing capabilities requiring only a user name and a password at checkout. This increases ease of use and customer convenience, while maintaining the highest levels of security for Visa cardholder accounts. ", "Rollout of our Click-to-buy functionality begins in November with pilot programs and integration with merchants. Following that, we will introduce subsequent releases in the first quarter of calendar year 2012, expanding functionality to include loyalty programs and the like over the following months.", "In parallel, we are committed to consumer choice and developing partnerships to ensure that core Visa products can be used easily no matter which wallet a consumer chooses to use. Our recent agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with other leading players in the social networking, mobile e-commerce and related industries.", "Another import element of our innovation strategy is creating new offerings that deliver differentiated value with the tremendous data that Visa generates. Our scale and reach provide the most compelling transaction information available in the world, and we will use this data to strategically grow our business. ", "We use that advantage today in applying aggregated anonymous data to power our advanced authorization service, which has helped to drive fraud rates to the lowest level in years. And now we intend to extend that capability to drive even more value to consumers as well as merchants. Let me be clear that we are 100% committed to maintaining the highest standard of security and privacy with this information. And of course, account-specific information will only be used with direct consumer permission.", "One example of what Visa can do with the information products is our real-time messaging service, which brings benefits of the virtual world to the point of sale. We are building sales momentum, and now have 14 major merchants under contract representing 68 brands across a wide range of verticals. We are exploring ways in which this platform can be leveraged to enhance issuers' relationship with their cardholders. ", "Prominent partners signed during the fourth quarter include United MileagePlus, Nordstrom's, Guess and Petco, and we are working towards more deals in the near term. I strongly believe this transaction in the market is a testament to the effectiveness of this product in enhancing the value proposition Visa offers to merchants by helping to drive their customer loyalty and sales, while also incenting routing decisions to the Visa network.", "Outside the U.S., we are investing in innovative mobile money solutions in both developed and emerging markets, recognizing that different geographies require specifically tailored [indiscernible]. An important key to our efforts is Fundamo, the global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing market. Fundamo has a track record of more than 50 successful client deployments in 40 countries including 27 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East and is in the process of integrating its mobile money services platform with VisaNet in an array of Visa products and services. I look forward to providing some important updates on our progress in the coming months.", "So to sum it up, I think the examples showcased by today highlight how Visa is building off of our strong foundation and moving ahead both in the U.S. and around the world. We are harnessing our strong core businesses, our competitive differentiators and our ongoing focus on new technologies to position Visa for revenue growth and as a leader of the payments industry well into the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations. First, Visa's 13% net revenue growth in the fourth quarter was once again broad based with solid 8% growth in the United States and a very strong 19% growth rate in Rest of World. Approximately 65% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States. This means non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 45% of Visa's total.", "Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 7 consecutive quarters of positive credit payment volume growth. Most recently, the months of August and September comped at 11% respectively, which continues the strong growth we have seen all year. While encouraging, much of this volume over the past year has been driven by affluent cardholders. As we enter fiscal 2012, it is worth noting that we have not yet seen any discernible broadening of the U.S. credit spending base beyond this affluent income group.", "Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19.5%, resulting in a full year incentive level of 17%, slightly ahead of our full fiscal year expectation.", "Two incentive callouts. First, on the issuing side. As telegraphed on our last earnings call, a disproportionate number of our contracts got signed in Q4. Second, on the acceptance side, we experienced greater success than anticipated in the signing of partnership contracts with merchants and acquirers. ", "Finally, operating expenses for the quarter were 2% above the prior year, while on a fiscal year basis, they were up 7%. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of previously unplanned restructuring expenses, close to 1/2 of which were the result of the decommissioning of our London office. The majority of these positions will be relocated to other countries, placing them closer to the clients we serve. And of course, we also incurred incremental expenses associated with the acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo. ", "Excluding the restructuring and acquisition-related cost, expense growth this fiscal year was in-line with our expectations for heightened investment spending to support our core businesses, our e-commerce and mobile initiatives, as well as the growth of our CyberSource business internationally. ", "Now let's turn to the numbers. First, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for both the June and September quarters, as well as results through October 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012. ", "Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13%, relatively flat from the June quarter. We saw the following breakdowns in the September quarter: In the U.S, payment volume growth was 9%, a slight decrease from the 10% growth we saw in the June quarter; Rest of World payment volume, on a constant-dollar basis grew at 18%, unchanged from the June quarter. ", "More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 9%. Although not yet available, based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect Rest of World payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin. ", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 15% growth rate on a constant-dollar basis in the September quarter, up slightly from a 14% rate in the June quarter. We continue to see a recovery in inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa and the longer-term trend, absent an economic downturn, appears to be back on track. Through October 21, cross-border volumes on a constant-dollar basis grew 13%.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior-year period and modestly behind the 11% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Through October 21, process transactions posted growth of 8%. ", "Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in regions outside of the United States, previously enacted pricing changes and solid cross-border transaction growth. ", "For the full fiscal year 2011, net revenues were $9.2 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue was moderated by our hedging activities and contributed 2 percentage points of growth in Q4 and on a full year basis.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% over the prior-year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, as well as previously enacted strategic pricing adjustments. ", "Data processing revenue was $925 million, up 10% over the prior year's quarter and based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. On that note, CyberSource posted a 31% gain in transaction over the prior year's quarter and 36% growth for the full fiscal year. ", "International transaction revenue was up 23% to $758 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States and above-average currency volatility during the period. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the full year came in at 17%, slightly ahead of a guidance, but fully consistent with our strategy to incent U.S. merchants and acquirers to choose Visa when routing signature and PIN debit transactions.", "Total operating expense for the quarter was $1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. As a reminder, these results include operating expenses for CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo, of which the latter 2 were not included in Q4 of the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2011, expenses totaled $3.7 million, a 7% increase over the 2010 period.", "As a final reminder, last October, we announced an earnings neutral change in income statement presentation related to revenue and operating expense associated with certain pass-through activities. Consistent with this announcement, $45 million of revenue and expense, which were booked in Q4 fiscal year 2010, did not reoccur in Q4 fiscal year 2011. In the current quarter, this represented 2 percentage points of revenue growth. ", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 57% after absorbing 120 basis points of impact from onetime restructuring charges. Our full fiscal year operating margin was 59%, in-line with our yearly guidance. Capital expenditures were $117 million in the quarter and totaled $353 million for the year. This was on target with last quarter's revised guidance.", "On the acquisition front, the PlaySpan acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 for the fourth quarter and $0.03 for the full year. The Fundamo acquisition was EPS dilutive by $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 for the full year.", "Finally, our reported GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 35% and 35.5% for the full year. Adjusting to exclude the beneficial impact of the put revaluation last quarter, the tax rate would have been 36.3% for the fiscal year, consistent with our guidance.", "As Joe mentioned, we were buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing 5.2 million shares at an average price of $80.87. For the full fiscal year, Visa spent $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43 million shares at an average price of $74.94. Inclusive of dividend payments, we returned over $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2011.", "At the end of the quarter, we had 687 million shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 692 million. ", "Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion increase to our existing share repurchase plan. Our current open to buy now stands at approximately $1.6 billion.", "As has been our practice, we will execute trades at prices we feel are attractive relative to the long-term value of Visa. We also raised our annual dividend 47% to $0.88 per share, which represents a payout ratio of about 17% on 2011 adjusted earnings.", "Finally, our guidance for fiscal 2012. Last quarter, we communicated to you our expectation for revenue and earnings. As Joe said at the outset, we remain comfortable with that initial look. Net revenue growth in the high single to low double-digit range and diluted EPS growth in the mid to high teens.", "Client incentives are expected to range from 17% to 18% of gross revenues. The modest uptick over fiscal 2011 is driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the United States, in combination with incentive contracts with large merchants aimed at influencing routing decisions for Visa debit transactions.", "Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion, while somewhat higher than the past 2 years, it is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions as well as some modest incremental spend associated with Visa's sponsorship of the summer Olympic game.", "Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The cash tax rate is expected to be in the 33% to 34% range. This reduction anticipates a change in the formula for calculating our state tax rate, as well as our initial filing for foreign tax credit. ", "Since this lower tax rate is expected to be ongoing, it will likely result in a revaluation of our deferred tax liability. This onetime non-cash adjustment may reduce Visa's tax rate an additional 1 to 2 percentage points for the year. However, to be clear, our adjusted earnings per share growth target for 2012 assumes a 33% to 34% cash rate.", "Capital expenditures are projected to range from $350 million to $400 million. This represents a modest increase over the $353 million we spent in 2011 and fully funds investments we're making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiative.", "Finally, we expect free cash flow above $4 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. As the fiscal 2013 guidance, as we previously stated in July, we expect an acceleration of revenue and EPS off 2012 levels.", "We will provide additional clarity around 2013 as we approach the beginning of that fiscal year. And with that operator, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bob Napoli, William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Question on the incentives. What are the length of terms of the merchant contracts, and would we expect to see the incentives higher earlier in the year as you continue to aggressively negotiate these routing incentives with the merchants?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Hi. Byron. The answer is the -- let's say, the average length of the merchant contracts that we have been signing are about 2 years. And to your second question, I would say no, they would be more \"back end of year\" weighted, once we begin to see what the actual routing experience is related to those contacts. Much of what was booked in the fourth quarter was onetime, and therefore, the bulk of the incentives associated with this will be validated during the course of the year once we understand what the actual routing experience is.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask a question related to the non-U.S. side of the business. Obviously, the growth remains very strong there. And I want to get a directional sense on the kind of revenue yield you are seeing outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. I guess we tend to think that it's less outside the U.S. because you aren't processing as much or as many of your own transactions there. So I just wanted to get a sense that if we continue to see this trend of non-U.S. growing revs and volumes faster than the U.S., what does that imply for overall operating margins over the longer term if you continue to go through that makeshift and ultimately get non-U.S. to be north of 50% of total revs?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "We've never disclosed what the revenues are in the countries outside the United States. Obviously, when we're not processing, there is a different yield structure. I just have to say that what is growing are our net revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues. So net of incentives, these are the revenues that we're booking. And so, I think that's a pretty good news story.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "And let me add 2 dynamics here. As we begin to grow and penetrate outside the United States, remember, the first areas that are penetrated tend to be cross-volume, cross-border types of transactions. So the yields there, early in the development curve, are much higher. As we begin to penetrate more and more domestic payment volume of countries outside the United States, domestic comes with less international. And therefore, the yields, frankly, in any country, including the United States, will naturally move down as domestic picks up a bigger piece of the payment volume. And then there's one final dynamic, which is actually important to understanding how our incentives behave in 2012, which is, when we originally went public, the notion of having multi-year contracts was primarily a U.S. phenomenon. What has happened over time is that we have pursued a deliberate strategy of entering into multi-year contracts with our major clients. As we have pursued that aggressively outside the United States, the quid pro quo for a multi-year contract is incentives. So as we put more, as our volumes build overseas, as more and more of our clients are under multi-year contract, our incentives will just naturally rise, which then has an impact on yield. So to sum, the most important element is what Joe said, we have a much higher degree of processing penetration in the U.S. Outside the U.S., because of that, it tends to be lower. But we pursue the strategies that optimize the growth of our revenue, and it is revenue measured in dollars we saw [ph]  for, not yield.", "Operator", "The next question comes Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask about client incentives as well, just in the quarter to clarify. Now these one timers designed to secure, I think, you said it was for merchant commitments. But did you also secure some network commitments from the issuers as well? And is there a way to quantify what percent of at-risk volume you've actually protected?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "It's merchant and acquirers, not issuers, which have been the focus, Tien-Tsin. And these contracts don't guarantee volume. What they do is they incent volume. And at this point, we're not public on the amount of volume, but it's a meaningful increment of volume that is influenced by these contracts.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I mean, as I mentioned in the script, we signed PNC to a longer-term contract. And we obviously have continued negotiations going on with all of our clients. And well, what Byron is talking about is generally the PIN volume and the decision to route the transaction that's in the hands of the merchant or the acquirer. There still are decisions that issuers make as it relates to the signature portion of the card, and we're in a very comfortable position as it relates to that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Lot of a good color on the call here. We're getting a lot of questions on the impact on debit growth from all these checking and DDA fees that banks are levying. So I think if you give us some color could kind of help investors out quite a bit. I mean, what's your take on how this could impact volume growth going forward? And can you draw any correlations to other experiences in the payment industry to kind of defend your view?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, first of all, I think the banks are clearly making recent business decisions to adapt in this newly regulated environment. I think all of the banks recognize that their customers have an option to move to a competitor. But they believe, in whatever case you're talking about, that their pricing or their future pricing will reflect the value, will reflect the value that they offer to their customers and the value that the customers bring to them. That being said, I don't believe that anything that's happening is going to substantially alter the macro debit volume in the United States. I don't think it's going to go away. Even the one fee that has been specifically announced is a flat fee. It doesn't make any difference. It's not a per-transaction fee, or anything of that nature. I think that, as a result of the recession and the result of the CARD Act, as a result of the Durbin legislation, you're also seeing a lot more activity wind up in prepaid cards. And our growth in that regard, which is really part of our debit-processing environment, is very significant also.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just want to go back to one item that I know came up here in the quarter about small ticket items and the pricing on those transactions. Can you guys go back and just walk us through what the sort of situation is there in terms of what pricing looks like and maybe how some of the potential unintended consequences here are being resolved with small ticket merchants?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I mean that's a good question. The answer is that there were a series of events that occurred, and the end result is that small ticket prices from both associations, were raised to the cap of the Durbin legislation. And I'm not sure that I'm not ready to comment on whether that is absolutely the right thing to do or not. What I will say is that we're pretty confident that there is an answer somewhere on the continuum that will benefit both financial institutions, consumers and merchants. And of course, we will endeavor to be a part of getting to the right solution over a reasonably short period of time.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask Byron about the incentives to merchants. You said the incentives for routing are for both signature and PIN. Just wanted to ask about the signature piece. What would you be incentivizing them for? Maybe you can explain that. Kind of semi-related to that, you guys think that some volume will go more towards PIN debit than signature debit in the marketplace and maybe why that would be?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So probably better expressed is, these are incentive agreements to deliver payment volume, whether it is signature or whether it is PIN. And so, that's the way to characterize that. And we'll just have to see how this plays out in terms of movement between signature and PIN. From our standpoint, it's important to preserve the routing. That's what we're focused on. And whether it's signature or PIN, we'll take both.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Remember, when we incent merchants to deliver volume, there's a lot of things that they can do in-store or otherwise with their customers that incent their customers to use these cards. And we've done that over the years in a pretty significant way, and we'll continue to do that. But it's important to us, so Byron's point of incenting merchants to deliver volume is exactly the right direction.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just when you guys had initially given guidance after some of the Durbin announcements, there was -- it was a discussion with conservatism embedded in on the guidance around what Durbin could mean. Just wondering, since that point, there's been some comments I think, Joe, you made since that point, that have suggested that I think you think you're going to come out okay on this. Just wondering, has anything changed in your expectations around what Durbin will impact your revenue by or your earning's power by? And then maybe just talk a little bit about also whether or not some of the embedded assumptions and conservatism guidance have shifted from Durbin to the macro picture?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I mean, obviously, the macro picture, Durbin, our business outside the United States, our prepaid and commercial businesses. When we give guidance, we embrace all of those things. And so, we gave guidance several months ago. We're delivering the same guidance today. We remain extraordinarily comfortable with that guidance. And everything that we think about Durbin, about the economy, about our competitive position is embraced within that guidance. And right now, we're very happy with where we are and what we're suggesting that we're going to do. And we'll see where it goes. But there's nothing that's happened in the last several months that would change our position on this.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Back in late September, we heard from industry contacts that Visa is moving to what we've been calling a common-switch strategy. And so, I wanted to ask about the revenue implications of the common-switch strategy. You alluded to this capability in your opening remarks. In particular, will PIN transactions on VisaNet be priced the same as Interlink PIN transactions in terms of network fees charged to both merchants and issuers? And if you can comment to the issuers receiving this common-switch strategy with open arms at this point?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, we are pursuing the strategy. We're comfortable with it. I mentioned it earlier today. We haven't had any negative reaction that I'm aware of. There is some work that needs to take place, but it is a rule, and I have no reason to believe that people won't adhere to it. In order to compete for a routing transaction in a predominantly PIN environment, it's going to have to be at similar pricing or the same pricing or lower pricing. And it's got to be Interlink-type pricing or we won't win the transaction, so I think that, that answers that question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering, not to beat the incentives thing too much to death, but you mentioned that a large portion of them were onetime. Did that include the incentives that went to merchants? Because I mean, I just was hoping you could explain how that would kind of spur them to bring volume with onetime incentives. And could you just also walk through just the signature PIN, the ability I guess to route over the signature network the PIN transactions that you alluded to?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, let me take the second part of the question first, and then I think I'll turn it over to Byron. But the ability to accept a PIN on our debit card network or our signature network is something that has existed for quite some time. We authorize millions of transactions a year, millions, which PIN numbers are used on our signature debit card. While we have defined it more specifically to make sure that everybody understands the capability and hasn't lost the functionality to be able to do that, but it is been a part of our signature card for many, many years.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "And to answer your first part of your question, the answer is, yes, that the one timers we're referring to were predominantly associated with the merchant and acquired contracts referenced earlier.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us some or quantify, if you will, Byron, the U.S. debit volume growth trends you've seen since interchange was cut 45% for issuers on October 1?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Honestly, it's way too early to comment on that. So we have seen no discernible change in U.S. debit volume associated with that October 1 date with the shift in the interchange. And that is something that we will give periodic updates on, of course, as the year unfolds. We are as interested in that as you are.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Katri, Cowen.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So considering some of the structural changes that are taking place on the debit side, is Visa doing anything different to maybe gain share in credit? And then, in that respect, can you also comment on whether some of the slowdown that we've seen as of October in some of the metrics, is that -- I mean, is there anything you can comment on that? Is there anything you can -- can you say anything about that in terms of maybe a proxy for future trends?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Why don't I take the second part first. The trends that we outlined earlier in my talk demonstrated a pretty strong September ending quarter. So I would say, whether you're looking at the U.S. or whether you're looking at Rest of World, those were pretty strong growth numbers. And it didn't look like we were missing a beat. And I'm looking at the numbers now. Split between credit and debit, both of them looked pretty strong, U.S. and Rest of World. And on top of that, these numbers are comping some pretty serious growth numbers in the prior year. When we move into October, recognizing that's only 21 days, I think in any given month, that is hardly a trend for a quarter. And I would say that there's nothing in the trend data yet to show any material shift in the trend curve.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "As it relates to pursuing credit card business, that is one of our primary focuses. I think we've talked about it before. I think we've talked about the relationships we have with our clients. We've talked about partnerships that we signed and talked [ph]  today, and we're very pleased with where we are. And we are extraordinarily client focused, and we are working with each of our clients on an individual basis to help them develop a credit card strategy, particularly, if they want to expand it, and many of them do. And I think that, that will be one of the big success stories of 2012.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask about it was kind of noticeable that U.S. credit volume growth outpaced debit volume growth in the quarter. It's probably the first time in, I would guess, years? And I was wondering if you can give some commentary on what sort of drove that? Did it perhaps have to do with some kind of competitive factors, i.e., some customer losses or maybe some customer response related to Durbin to drive credit volumes in lieu of debit. Just some color and commentary there.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes, so, you're right. This is -- I'm looking at the data right now. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of credit card year-over-year growth. Eight quarters ago, it was actually negative. And I think what we're seeing here is a just a continuation of a recovery. The recession hit credit hard, and it actually turned growth negative. And I'm speaking here of the U.S. And so, in the first quarter of recovery, which was second quarter, our second fiscal quarter 2010, growth was 3% year-over-year. It has gradually moved up, so that now, for the quarter just ended, it's 10%, 10% in October. And so for us, this is been a gradual return to credit. It's been a sustained but very modestly paced build. And then, as you may recall from my earnings commentary today and really over the past several quarters, this is a credit recovery that is primarily in the U.S. affluent driven. And that through the quarter, through, I would say the June quarter, which is the data where we have more granular data, this growth is primarily affluent, and we haven't really seen a broadening of the credit base yet. So that's in terms of increased and growth and spend [ph]. And so, that is the opportunity to come. And with a further recovery, we expect credit to benefit -- future credit benefit growth to benefit from that expanded set of cardholders.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital.", "Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So as we look at the trends for worldwide process transactions, and I know that the absolute number transactions are still relatively high, but that trend has been coming down throughout the year. And then most recent data, Byron, that you pointed to, is around 8%. So it continues to be kind of on the downward slope. So I'm wondering, what do you attribute that to? And then secondly, to the extent that, that trend continues, do you feel like your business and your strategy going forward is such that you can drive incremental revenue growth, I think from a greater standpoint from increasing prices, throughout the year as opposed to just kind of the secular volume growth?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Our focus on growth is primarily the secular growth. We're not looking to drive any material top line revenue growth from pricing, recognizing that when we talk about pricing, that's pricing net of incentives. So it's one thing to adjust your pricing at the top level. But in the end, it's your net pricing that really matters. And so, it is primarily secular growth, which is one of the reasons why we continue to emphasize how much growth we are now delivering outside the United States. And in the quarter just ended, 65% of our growth, our revenue growth, came from outside the United States. And in the fourth quarter, 45% of our entire revenue base is now outside the United States. And as you know, we have an objective to drive that over 50%, and that is absolutely secular growth. With regards to the process transaction growth, that is primarily attributable to 2 things: one, a slowing in the growth rate of U.S. debit; and then second, a year ago, we began -- we had some significant increases in transaction penetration outside the United States, which are now beginning to anniversary. And so, where we are today and that drift down into high single digits, in terms of Visa process transactions, is primarily influenced by those 2 factors for the moment. But we are very focused in our future strategies at increasing Visa process transactions, increasing the percent of transactions, particularly outside the United States, that Visa processes as a function of the total transactions that are performed on Visa cards. And that's where we stand.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you, Jos\u00e9, and thank you, all, for joining us today.

And as always, thank you for joining us today. ", "Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross-border activity. ", "Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011. ", "Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. ", "With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. ", "Visa's global business continues to expand at a healthy pace. A strong March quarter followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%. ", "In the U.S., payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer for fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact, of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2015 and beyond. From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3/4 of our U.S. credit volume secured into 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success, winning important new credit business from multiple U.S. issuers. ", "On the co-brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a large number of affluent cardholders and a high cross-border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under MileagePlus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued MileagePlus cards. ", "As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no-signature-required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available to the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time. ", "Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. where the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive, but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies. ", "So far, the situation is playing out as we expected, and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth and, as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact. ", "To really understand what's happening in our Debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, Visa Debit and Interlink, independently. Visa Debit, also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest, albeit slowing, payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities. ", "Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month of the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind, though, that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes and recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter. ", "Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. ", "For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitor's brand. More importantly, our comprehensive, integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions. ", "On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa Debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that go until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority spanning beyond that. ", "As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants. ", "Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for a healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S. ", "On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN-authenticated Visa Debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we met with the department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and that our response to the DOJ supports that. ", "But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007, each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. ", "So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we planned for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013, take everything I've discussed into account. ", "Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I have said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients, we are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. ", "Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue. ", "Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors. ", "With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years. ", "We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters. ", "This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals: ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa. And, just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers. ", "At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross-border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these rapidly expanding regions. ", "On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions in CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are paying off and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments. ", "This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to extend Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. Vodafone, the second largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network. ", "Orange telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East a Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number. ", "At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Near Field Communication technology. Our previously announced agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace. ", "Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter include an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel's soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new Lumia smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave. ", "To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we executed a deal with Oberthur Technologies to roll out Visa's mobile provisioning service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device. ", "It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource, and I'm pleased to say that quarter after quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago. ", "At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by co-selling Visa processing services and CyberSource merchant, gateway and fraud services. ", "For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and direct connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Cielo, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants. ", "These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together, and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. ", "Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visa's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we are providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. Together, Fundamo and CyberSource fill the commerce need for a simple account checkout and authorization process. ", "I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance mark, and another example of how we are applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers. ", "A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways and places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and alerts. It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on. ", "Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations, and we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants. ", "This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reQ10sbuy.com [ph]. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing, core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress. ", "On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers, and we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and are engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients. ", "In parallel, we need to bring additional merchants onboard. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants onboard to hold a full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda, and flawless execution will be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful. ", "And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in is both highly competitive and dynamic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance. ", "Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong, globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. ", "And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. ", "First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower, ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05. ", "Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance. ", "Second. Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in Rest of World. ", "Third. U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth. Most recently, through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery. ", "Fourth. As expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth, though modestly positive for the March quarter, will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes, primarily on Interlink volumes, picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category. ", "Fifth. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold. ", "Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate, at this point in time, growth in the high teens. ", "Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. ", "Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%. ", "Several call-outs. First, credit in both U.S. and Rest of World picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1; second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1; third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%. ", "More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning-of-year projections. ", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears solid. ", "Through April 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with a U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%. ", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%. ", "Four call-outs. First. Visa-processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World. ", "Second. As expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January. ", "Third. Given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year. ", "Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning-of-year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings. ", "Now. Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral. ", "Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter. ", "Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. ", "International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with mid-teen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World. ", "As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step-up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers. ", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies. ", "Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. ", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this is largely due to the expense timing as we expect a second half ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. ", "Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter. Given an expected ramp-up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. ", "Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for a full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged. ", "Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing. ", "At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million. ", "Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated, year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross-border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies. ", "And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And I really appreciate all the color on the DOJ situation. I think that was very helpful. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the new FANF  fee structure, which I understand just went into effect about a month ago. But what's been the reaction from the merchant community now that we're actually in implementation, finally? And do you anticipate any roadblocks with the implementation there, putting the DOJ situation aside?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, this is Joe Saunders. We implemented that on April 1, so there hasn't been any reaction because I don't believe the fee has been billed to anyone yet. Although [ph], there hasn't been a lot of reaction to it. It is part of our -- the total structure we've put to deal with the Durbin regulation. We are not making money per se off of that fee. The combination of discounts and incentives that we have put together, I think, actually relate in a modest loss in the amount of $100 million a year. So we aren't doing this with the intent of raising prices. I don't think that -- well, I don't -- I know that we haven't had any difficulties in getting the structure going, so I think we'll have to wait and see how everything works out.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a follow-up to that, on the CID. Does it in any way change your desire to utilize the, I guess, you call it FASB [ph]? Or is it business as usual there with that product? And also, just the service fee yield. Byron, it was up quite a bit more than what we had modeled. Was there a price change there or a reclass? Or maybe just a mix change? Any help there would be great.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Why don't you go ahead?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes, yes. Let me start with the second one, Tien-Tsin. So there has been a mix change. If you look at the payment volume growth, nominally it's 11%. And our service fee growth was 13%. So if I look at it that way, roughly 1% of the -- or roughly half of the increase has been a boost in yield because of the lower mix of Interlink transactions, as I think you were referring to, and the -- our hedging actually produced another percentage point of gain and the rest, I would say, is noise.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "As it relates to the strategies that we've implemented, we just implemented them. I don't have any desire to change what we've done. But we put these in place in anticipation of an environment, and we'll look at them and we'll monitor them and we'll change them if it's appropriate to change them. Otherwise, we'll continue down the path. I think that it would be safe to say that we were more successful in dealing with the -- our relationships going forward and we could have projected in the past. So we'll just have to look at everything and take it all into consideration and we'll do what's appropriate. Once again, though, I mean, I feel that the guidance projections that we've made for 2012 and 2013 are safe to support in almost any environment of things that might or might not happen.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just so I have the pattern right, so we have -- PIN went negative in January, the PIN growth trajectory. Furthermore, we're a further step down after April 1. You have incentives increasing in the second half. But then you talk about the drag on the PIN growth is supposed to ease by September. So it hasn't anniversaried yet because we haven\u2019t  reached next January or next April. So is the logic behind that, just so I have it right, because you're expecting these incentives you're going to pay out to sort of get that volume back to you? Do I have that right?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "You have everything right except the PIN piece. The -- you're right, the -- it's going to take 4 quarters to annualize. So when we referred to a positive trajectory, what we meant by that was the impact of payment volume on lag year-over-year will have its greatest impact in Q3. We would then expect continued negative comparisons through -- until we annualized but at an increasingly less negative rate as we progress through the 4 quarters. That would also be true for debit-related transactions. So PV and transactions.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Let me just follow up on that and make perfectly clear one thing. And that is that we are never going to regain all of the market share that we had in the debit card business. Nothing that we say or none of our strategies suggest that, that will happen or could happen or -- and nothing that we've done or thought about or said anticipates that it will happen. The environment has changed by regulation. We're operating in a different world, and we're going to live forever with less share than we once had.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I guess I had a -- you answered my question on just the market share but maybe on share buyback. I mean, I guess you guys didn't buy back stock because you felt the stock was somewhat fairly valued. But, I mean, did -- should we assume that if the shares stay at these levels, you wouldn't buy back any more throughout the remainder of the year?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "No, you shouldn't. We are a committed management team to returning excess cash to shareholders. I think if you take a -- and so -- and we remain committed to that. If you would take a step back, we had a very large, in our view, very large share repurchase in the first quarter. And so we time our purchases over the course of the year, looking for both opportunities to do that at attractive pricing but also, in the case of the first quarter, being responsive to an opportunity to put a significant increment of cash into the escrow account. So I think if you take a step back year-to-date, we're all -- we've already made sizable repurchases, and you can count on us to continue to return excess cash not just for this year but years to come.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Williams with UBS.", "John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. On the marketing budget, just as we think forward into the rest of the year, regarding calendarization related to the Olympics, and any other things we might need to think about and -- as we look at the marketing line?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "I'm not sure what else to add other than every 4 years, we have a particularly attractive opportunity to put significant media into 2 quarters, which is the third and the fourth. And knowing that, that was the feature of what we want to emphasize this year, we kept -- we phased our marketing in the first 2 quarters in order to accommodate that. We will reset marketing from a bottoms up standpoint beginning next year and, in October, give you a sense of what that will look like.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just Joe, I mean, just trying to clarify a comment. You said, on '12, '13 guidance, you thought it was safe under very -- under various circumstances. Are you suggesting that if you needed to adjust your strategy based upon the CID, that you still felt confident in your -- in the guidance? Is that -- am I reading that right or not?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "That -- the Department of Justice is certainly included in what I said, but it will include a lot more than that. But yes, absolutely certain.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And, I mean, the CID, I mean, is mostly focused on -- I mean, I guess would you -- would you view it focused mostly on the 2% of revenue of that strategy, on that 2% piece of the revenue or more broadly?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "I mean, I don't know how to get into that specifically. You\u2019re asked general questions about what you're doing to react to the legislation, and it's the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. So obviously, they must have a concern that we were doing things that might undermine that and -- but I don't really want to go any further. I mean, I'm not them, and I can't say that. We have talked to them. We provide information to them. And we have obviously very seriously considered various things that may or may not happen, and we've taken it into consideration and in our guidance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You've had really impressive growth on the credit side, especially the acceleration we've seen from last quarter. Byron, maybe you can talk a bit more about the various moving parts in terms of the major drivers here? Can we talk about the consumer side versus the corporate side?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes, our business is still largely driven by the consumer side for sure. The commercial side is growing at good rates. We are very encouraged by the numbers being posted on the commercial side because we think, first and foremost, that's a healthy barometer with regards to how businesses are doing and the continuity in the kind of payment volume growth we're seeing, particularly in credit. And if you take a look at the cross border, which is probably our most important leading indicator, the cross-border trends in both consumer retail as well as commercial are very strong. And so within -- and that is one of the indicators we look to when we put out our guidance, and one of the inputs that gave us confidence to raise our guidance for the year.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Yes. On the consumer side, I mentioned in my comments the extension of our partnerships with a number of financial institutions that represent a significant portion of our volume. I mentioned the United-Continental arrangement, which is going to deliver new volume to us. I mentioned signing other financial institutions that we have done less business with in the past. I mentioned Alaska Airlines. And so the trajectory of what we're doing, we're very happy with, and we're very bullish about it. We're very pleased that this is happening at this opportune time.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I hate to go back to the whole debit thing. But I guess I'm trying to understand how -- the market share loss is that extreme in the short run? I know the revenue impact isn't that large. But even in terms of just the transactions, if your -- if the process allows the merchant to route the transaction over the Signature network -- or has not yet been put in place? In other words, was that -- because otherwise, how is that market share loss that significant if that was already in place?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "The \u2013- [indiscernible] you suggest wasn't started until April 14 and isn't fully implemented and won't be for several weeks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess I expected a decline in Interlink volume. But specifically, what's happened in Visa Debit volume that you expect in 3Q and 4Q? And I guess inside of that, how much of that is market share loss versus just banks maybe deemphasizing signature debit?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "It's hard to be a totally specific about it. I think that, that has leveled off, and we continue to look at modest growth. But right now, I would attribute the majority of it to the removal of all the rewards programs. I mean, there virtually are no rewards programs associated with debit cards anymore. And those programs did drive volume. And a de-emphasis in marketing these programs by the financial institutions. It's a combination of those 2 things that had an effect on it. There were some small pockets of cards that were put out that never had a PIN capability, and the regulation requires that, that change. And so people that simply couldn't use the PIN numbers, can now. Yes, it -- a combination of those 3 things, in our opinion, at this point in time is pretty much what's going on in the Signature business.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just to make sure I have this clear in my earnings addled mind, Byron, when you talk about total transaction volume in the back half of fiscal '12 in aggregate across the business, you're thinking about transaction volume being down, correct? And does that mix -- does the shift in mix away from Interlink change kind of what we should think about as the data processing yield as a consequence?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes, it -- so my commentary on transactions was for debit, specifically, in aggregate. The -- what I think what will become increasingly important as we look at processed transactions is U.S. credit. And then, separately, what are we doing in the Rest of the World. And I think we indicated that we have very, very vibrant transaction growth rates in U.S. credit as -- and in Rest of World. And with regards to yield, we'll give this -- there is definitely going to be some disconnects in the way that you're -- that you look at this from a modeling standpoint because the -- I think one of the -- you heard this earlier. One of the natural effects of pulling out Interlink transactions is -- since it only affects the DP line, there will be a natural drop just because it will be generating last DP fees. But it's also removing payment volume for which there are no service fees. So that will actually boost the service fee yield on the transactions that remain. And we will give some thought as to how to talk about that with you all by the next earnings call to help sort that out. And if that weren't enough, we're going to take the -- I think we've already mentioned we're going to take the fixed acquiring network fee. And we're -- for the most part, that will appear in data processing as a line item. So we have some work to do to make this more transparent with regards to what will happen to those lines, what we think will happen to those lines. And we'll plan that for next quarter's earnings call.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "And as -- just as a reminder, the transaction loss in Interlink is coming from a business that a year ago generated 2.8% of our global revenue and last quarter generated 2% of our global revenue. It gives you an idea of the notion that there are different yields upon different types of payment volume.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Len DeProspo with Janney.", "Leonard A. DeProspo - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "This is a question with regard to sort of the advertising promotion expense. I think the Olympics are going to happen entirely in your fourth quarter, but I assume you all will be doing some spending out of that. So could you just help us break out how much of that incremental spending will occur in the third quarter versus fourth quarter, maybe just percentage split?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes, we don't typically provide that. But you are absolutely right. There is a considerable amount of promotional activity done with our banking partners, which has actually -- some of which actually started in our second fiscal quarter. It really ramps during the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, you have the last of the broadcast media that is fairly intensive around the Olympics themselves. So to be helpful here, we are holding -- we've said we are holding to our existing marketing guidance so that you have an order of magnitude and you now have 2 quarters in the can. And in terms of what our full year results are likely to be, I think we've bounded that pretty well. And between the quarters, we just -- as I said, we typically just don't break that out.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Yes. You should also think about the fact that the advertising we do in the third and the fourth quarter supports the programs that many of our financial institutions initiate around the Olympics with Olympic theme cards, and that those initiatives generate more particularly credit card volume, which is the reason that we do this. We have, I think, almost -- on a global basis almost 3x as many financial institutions participating in promotions this year as we did 4 years ago.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Guys, just to go back to the 2013 commentary, Byron, can you just walk us back through both the revenue expectations and the EPS expectations? I want to make sure we have the -- both of those numbers there correct.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So on the revenue, what we said was our expectation is that revenue in '13 will grow off of 2012 levels. So whatever the growth rate in revenue is for 2012, everything else being equal, we would expect it to be somewhat higher in 2013. With regards to EPS growth, if you recall, back in the October earnings call when we reaffirmed the '13 guidance, what we said was we expected EPS to also grow off of 2000 levels, but our expectation at that point, and our guidance at that time on 2012, was that EPS would grow mid to high teens. We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step-down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we began to, in effect, outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we wanted to make it clear that when we talked about 2013, our expectation was more high teens, recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or possible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS, and  that way, we'd be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13. And so that's why we want to make very clear that, at least at this point in time, our earnings growth guidance should be in the high teens range.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wondered if I could just ask a question around the commentary around processing transactions in Brazil. Curious to what extent this has some impact on the conversation around revenue yield, if it's something we would notice if that ramps up over the next couple of quarters. And in conjunction with that, is there further opportunity with bank partners or other services around this agreement to continue to improve that yield if that relationship would mature further in years?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "The increase in processing on VisaNet in Brazil has a -- does have an effect on our yield because we're going to be receiving revenues for transactions going over VisaNet that we didn't before. It's going to ramp up over a period of time. I don't think that we're in position right now to tell you how that's going to affect our global yields or our global -- or even our global revenues in the short run. We're very excited about it because it puts us in a position in Brazil similar to the United States where not only are we going to be processing more transactions but we will be able to deliver other revenue generating services. And I think that you'll begin to see that manifest itself in our 2013 projection.", "Operator", "The last question does come from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "One clarification, Byron, in response to an earlier question, I think, on the service fee yield, the service fee as a percentage of volume. You had said it's a \u2013- it\u2019s a mix -- or about half of it is a mix issue and the other half is hedging. Just so I understand right, service fees are not earned on Interlink. So the mix we're seeing there is the -- dividing by a lower denominator? Is that what's causing the mix -- the issue -- that yield to go up? And then my unrelated question would be on V.me, do you expect to have anything in your marketing budget or any significant amount on your budgeting for that fourth quarter Christmas holiday launch? I mean, is this going to be a pretty significant launch this year? Or is it going to be more of a soft launch?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "You go ahead.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes, let me take the first one. Yes, you have it right. What we have -- when you remove the Interlink transactions, you're removing transactions from the denominator, but you're not touching the service fees. So the yield automatically starts moving up.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "As it relates to V.me, we will have -- certainly have some advertising in that. But the advertising that we will do will be in conjunction with merchants that are coming on to the network and through financial institutions to encourage their customers to enroll. So I guess in that regard, it would be soft here, and, I guess, you mean [ph] national TV advertising in the fourth quarter.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.", "And with that, I turn the call over to Joe.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you all for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that our hearts and thoughts are with the people on the East Coast of the United States who are now recovering from Hurricane Sandy. Many of our clients, our employees, our partners and investors like you live in affected areas. And we hope that you, your families and your neighbors are all safe and moving toward a full and speedy recovery.", "Visa closed out fiscal 2012 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering net operating revenues of $2.7 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.54, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The adjustment in diluted earnings reflects the impact of a $627 million increase in net income during the fourth quarter from the reversal of tax reserves and accrued interest associated with our covered litigation. This was due to the withdrawal of the notice of proposed adjustment by the IRS during the quarter. Byron will provide additional commentary.", "Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by particularly strong payments volume growth for credit products in the United States, as well as continued expansion of our core business and growth of processed transactions in international markets.", "Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue in 2012 was a record $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over 2011. Adjusted net income was $4.2 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $6.20, 24% ahead of last year.", "Now let's turn the discussion to what's ahead in 2013. Byron will get into specifics on broad guidance for fiscal 2013, but we are reaffirming our commitment to a growth rate in the high teens for adjusted diluted earnings per share. That being said, Visa is taking a measured approach to the coming year. We are mindful of uncertainties in the global operating environment, including softness in some pockets of the global economy and continued volatility in Europe. And given our better-than-anticipated performance in fiscal 2012, we essentially raised the bar in ourselves and now face somewhat tougher comparisons in the coming year.", "With that in mind, at this early point in fiscal 2013, we are once again setting our net revenue guidance growth to low-double digits. An improving economic environment could well change our view, but we'll take a prudent road for the time being.", "Effective tomorrow, Charlie Scharf becomes Visa's Chief Executive Officer. I will continue as Executive Chairman of the company until March 31, at which point I plan to retire. Charlie's appointment was the result of a thorough and robust succession process. Charlie is a proven leader. He has experience as a senior executive with large global enterprise and is familiar with Visa both as a client and as a board member. Importantly, Charlie drove innovation well at the helm of Chase's retail operation. I am confident that Charlie will hit the ground running, not miss a beat and accelerate our forward momentum. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless. And I'm sure he looks forward to getting to know you better, and that he will talk to you directly when he leads our next earnings call.", "Given Visa's outlook for growth, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, our as-converted common share count was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share by spending $324 million. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1.5 billion for Class A share repurchases. Additionally, as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 50% over last year's rate to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis.", "Turning to our business in the United States. Overall, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to expand Visa's business in the rapidly evolving technological and competitive landscape. Our business is tracking closely with our expectations. For credit products, Visa extended our gains. During the September quarter, payment volume grew 9% with particular strength from our products. Prepaid growth also continues to be strong in the United States with the general purpose of payroll segments serving as our 2 biggest growth drivers in the category during the September quarter, posting 28% and 30% payment volume growth respectively.", "Now let's turn to U.S. debit, where the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance. Quarter by quarter, we are getting smarter about how to operate in the new environment in which we wish to pull to grow our debit business. That being said, I want to reiterate our belief that the share loss resulting from the Dodd-Frank regulation is both permanent and fully incorporated in our FY '13 guidance.", "Overall U.S. debit growth rates have stabilized since our last earnings report, with aggregate debit payment volume growth modestly improving to negative 6% during the September quarter. Further, we have been working with issuers to secure long-term contracts. To that end, we've secured our top 15 U.S. debit issuers to long-term agreements.", "In short, our revised strategies for the U.S. debit segment continue to gain traction in the marketplace, achieving Visa's own operational and financial expectations while simultaneously delivering value and benefit to our clients.", "As for the U.S. Department of Justice's civil investigative demand, I have no material update. We are regularly submitting data to the DOJ. The company will continue to update you as the situation develops, but we remain comfortable in our position on this issue.", "At the same time, we are making steady progress towards completing the previously announced merchant litigation settlement in the United States. On October 19, the merchant plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval. Subsequently, the judge set an accelerated timetable last week, which calls for hearings on the motion on November 9. We are hopeful the judge will grant preliminary approval shortly thereafter, with the rules becoming effective 60 days later. Bottom line, I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of merchants will support the agreement and it will be approved.", "Now let's briefly turn to Visa's international geographies where payment volume growth moderated slightly during the fiscal fourth quarter but still delivered strong revenue growth of 13% as we continue to maintain our strong competitive leadership position. Overall, we continue to advance towards our goal of generating 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. To drive growth, we continue to apply a targeted investment strategy, which deploys locally tailored acceleration plans within several key geographies. In doing so, our goal is to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year time horizon.", "In the interest of time, I won't walk through a list of new and expanded agreements from the quarter. But suffice it to say, we continue to grow our relationships with financial institutions, merchants and governments of all sizes around the world. And these are driving payment volume and processed transactions, as well as revenue growth for Visa. This approach will continue to be a priority as our organization moves ahead in the future.", "Lastly, let me talk about Visa's innovation agenda, an area where we are making considerable progress. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business platforms, add incremental value to the merchant community and their acquirers and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our financial institution clients. But most importantly, we know that our innovations must create real value for our clients and account holders who ultimately use these products and services.", "Let's start with V.me, our digital wallet. We are making significant progress putting together the network that will enable us to scale consumer adoption of V.me. On the issuer front, we recently announced 2 major partners, PNC and U.S. Bank, both of which will make an immediate impact as we begin to grow users of the product. All together, we have 34 agreements signed with leading U.S. issuers, including 4 of our 10 largest institutions in the United States. Looking ahead, we're confident that the number will continue to grow. Together, they give us the opportunity to tap roughly 50 million consumers through our bank partners. We look forward to making additional announcements in this area in the coming months.", "At the same time, we're making progress to signing up merchants for V.me. By the middle of 2013, we expect to have more than 1,000 online merchants using V.me, including 20 of the 50 largest e-commerce merchants in the country. I want to reiterate that V.me is designed to help capture the significant immediate growth opportunity in e-commerce. e-commerce is one of our fastest-growing channels, with Forrester Research predicting that U.S. consumers will spend $327 billion online by 2016, up 45% from the $226 billion in 2012.", "As a reminder, V.me creates a simplified and secure e-commerce experience for consumers no matter what payment device or technology they choose to transact with. This offers our clients a differentiated solution to address a real market opportunity today and provides a fast and convenient experience with consumers making online purchases.", "At the same time, Visa is a leader in enabling NFC payments at the point of sale in the United States. As one example, Isis, the payments joint venture founded by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, is currently enabling Visa payments via NFC in its own mobile wallet as part of their recently launched pilot. Isis's open approach aligns with Visa's strategy of enabling consumers to make mobile payments with whatever device they choose using the trusted accounts they already have. Consumer adoption of NFC is in its very early stages today. And I'm very comfortable that Visa is well positioned to deliver the best mobile solutions to our clients, helping them take advantage of this long-term shift in consumer behavior.", "Also on the innovation front, I'm pleased that CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions total $1.4 billion, growing 25% versus the same period a year ago. CyberSource's unique capabilities are particularly resonating in international markets. At the time we bought CyberSource, they had field operations in only 4 countries. Today, that number is 12 and growing, and CyberSource teams are benefiting from Visa's local market knowledge.", "To conclude, I'd like to say again how proud I am of what we've accomplished toward Visa. Since our restructuring 5 years ago, we have successfully delivered on all of our investor commitments and transitioned to a solid public company that will continue to compete globally well into the future. Visa is built on a simple yet effective strategy: To be the best way to pay and be paid. To deliver on that promise, we have created an organization that is focused on delivering payment products and services to the evolving needs of consumers, merchants, governments and financial institutions. We have also established a culture that can adapt to a fast-changing landscape and thrive in the midst of challenges. And we are well positioned to continue to expand our core business, invest in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments and accelerate expansion of our business outside of the United States.", "Today, I know we have the right people, the right strategy, the right technology and the right experience to continue to be a leader of our industry. And with Charlie as CEO, I am confident that Visa will continue to grow globally and deliver innovation that meets the needs of Visa account holders and our clients.", "I'd like to thank everyone at Visa, all of our partners and all of our investors for the opportunity to work with you. I look forward to seeing Visa take full advantage of all that lies ahead.", "And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or Notice of Proposed Adjustment, in connection with the deductibility of our litigation payments made in 2008, had been withdrawn. As a result, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with all covered litigation expense previously recorded. This increased net income for the quarter by $627 million.", "Second, U.S. revenue growth continues to be supported by solid credit payment volume growth, although our 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth were interrupted as the September quarter clocked in at 9%. Through the 28th of October, however, credit payment volume growth has comped at an 11% rate, a notable rebound, reflecting a month-to-month volatility dynamic we've seen more of recently.", "Third, with 4 quarters of lower U.S. debit interchange and 2 quarters of the new debit routing rule behind us, the impacts have been manageable. Aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter versus a negative 9% in the third quarter led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 48% versus 54% in the third quarter. While we are pleased our mitigation strategies are working as planned and are consistent with our expectations, we would caution that the U.S. debit environment is still evolving.", "Finally, as was the case last quarter, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. Management's view of the future effects have been incorporated into our guidance.", "Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter followed by our results through October 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013.", "Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 6%, unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. grew at 1% and Rest of World at 12%. More recently, through October 28, U.S. payment volume growth posted a 3% gain comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 4% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, which compares to a 14% rate in the third quarter. The U.S. grew 8% and the Rest of World, 11%. The moderation in growth was broad-based, with notable stepdowns in the U.S., North and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Through October 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and Rest of World at 12%.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 2% increase over the prior year period and up from 1% in the prior quarter. A debit-led decline of 1% in the U.S. was offset by a 19% growth in the Rest of World. For the month of October through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a positive 4%, driven by an improving trajectory in the U.S.", "Separately, CyberSource recorded 1.4 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year.", "Three callouts. First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product, where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the routing rules in the middle of next year. Second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and Rest of World. Finally, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we are operating under the assumption that the U.S. and global economies will continue their moderate growth over the next 12 months as uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, continued Eurozone concerns and a general slowdown in world trade put a damper on domestic consumer cross-border spending.", "Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year and ahead of our expectations as a result of stronger U.S. debit and credit performance. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year and a better performance than we had anticipated going into the year. After hedges, there was negative 1% foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter and no impact to the full year.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates from Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S. and for CyberSource globally, as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective last quarter. The step-up in gross revenue data processing yield, which we first saw last quarter, continued to carry through this quarter due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the ongoing, though moderating, decline in Interlink transactions, which are, by far, our lowest-yielding product.", "International transaction revenue was up 5% to $796 million, reflecting solid but moderating strength in cross-border volumes, with mid-single-digit-growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, low-double-digit growth in Latin America and low 20s in our SEMEA region as measured on a constant dollar basis.", "Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenues came in at 17%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to better-than-expected revenue performance but in line in terms of absolute dollars. For the fiscal year 2012, incentives were 17% of gross revenues, at the low end of our guidance of 17% to 18%.", "While total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18%, it is important to note that this heavier-than-normal operating expense level is not a new quarterly run rate. When viewed on a full year adjusted basis, expenses grew 12%, of which approximately 2 percentage points were due to annualizing acquisition expenses. And as expected, this annual expense growth was consistent with delivering a 60% adjusted operating margin, which was our guidance for the year.", "As further perspective on expenses, 3 callouts. First, we staged more of our investment spend in the second half of the year to enable a tighter linkage between revenue and expense growth. Second, marketing spend of $271 million intensified in Q4, associated with the London Olympics. For the full year, marketing expenses were $873 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year and in line with our guidance. And finally, third, we took over $30 million in Q4 restructuring reserves, which included the closing of our San Francisco offices and consolidation of our staff into our Foster City campus. Looking ahead to 2013, we have planned a closer balance between first and second half operating spend.", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 56%, bringing our fiscal full year adjusted margin to 60%, which, as noted earlier, was on target with our guidance for the year. Capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter and ended the fiscal year at $376 million. This roughly represents the midpoint of our guidance range.", "Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was 33%, and for the entire fiscal year, 33%. As I mentioned at the outset, both of these figures were affected by events over the course of the year.", "During the quarter, total as-converted Class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share, utilizing $324 million of operating cash on hand. This is inclusive of the $150 million escrow funding made in late July. As Joe mentioned at the outset, our board recently authorized a new repurchase program totaling $1.5 billion effective through October of 2013. This is incremental to the $865 million still outstanding from our previous authorization.", "We also raised our annual dividend 50% to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a payout ratio of about 21% on 2012 adjusted earnings.", "At the end of the September quarter, we had 668 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter totaled 672 million, and for the full fiscal year, 678 million.", "Finally, let me finish up with our guidance for fiscal 2013. In terms of the top line, as Joe said at the outset, we are guiding to net revenue growth in the low double digits, though the possibility of upside exists if we were to see a noticeably stronger economic rebound over the course of the year than we are currently experiencing. As a reminder, going in the fiscal 2012, we built into our internal projections a sustained but modest recovery for that year, with fiscal Q3 and Q4 bearing the brunt of U.S. debit regulation followed by economic acceleration in 2013.", "That said, the trends in the past 2 quarters suggest economic assumptions around 2013 were too optimistic. Many of the same uncertainties remain. And while we lost significant U.S. debit share, we weathered the second half of 2012 better than we expected. As we look ahead into 2013, growing uncertainty in the U.S. and world economy has precipitated a slowdown in domestic and cross-border spending. When we combine this global outlook with the higher bar created by better-than-anticipated 2012 revenue growth, we now find ourselves in a situation similar to 2012 and believe revenue guidance in the low-double-digit range is the right call at this time.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth remains the same, at a high teens rate. Client incentives, as a percent of gross revenue, are expected to range between 18% and 18.5%. We expect this modest increase over fiscal 2012 to be driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the U.S. in combination with incentive contracts with large U.S. merchants and acquirers.", "Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion. However, we will see modest moderate uptick over the level of fiscal 2012 with more of the marketing spend budgeted in the first half versus the prior year. The uptick will be driven by greater investment in our APCEMEA region, as well as incremental investments behind our V.me and mobile initiatives.", "Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range. This reduction anticipates benefits from foreign tax credits to be claimed in fiscal 2013. We anticipate the timing of these benefits to be skewed more to the second half of the fiscal year.", "Capital expenditures are projected to range from $425 million to $475 million. This represents a moderate increase over the $376 million we spent in 2012 and fully funds investments we are making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiatives.", "Finally, we expect free cash flow of about $5 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: first, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Before we take your questions, recognizing Joe's retirement next March, I want to briefly reflect on Visa's 5 years as a merge to business entity and our 4.5-year public life. With 2008 as a base year and despite a deep U.S. recession and challenging regulatory environment, under Joe's leadership, the Visa team has delivered net revenue growth at a 14% compound annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS at a 29% compound annual growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin has gone from 46% in March of 2008 to 60% today. We lowered our tax rate from 41% to 33%. We have tripled our dividend rate through annual increases and have collectively returned $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders IPO to date. Lastly, over that same period of time, we have reduced our common share count through litigation escrow funding and open market purchases by 118 million shares, representing $9 billion returned to shareholders.", "And with that, operator, for the 19th time since going public, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I had a question on your new CEO starting tomorrow, Charlie. I guess why -- what led you to Charlie Scharf? I mean, this is a dynamic time technology business, international growth. Charlie's, everything we can tell, is a very strong executive but more of a U.S. Bank guy. What were the key choices in selecting Charlie and going outside the company today versus internal?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, as I mentioned in my comments today, he's a dynamic executive, he has done well. He understands our business. He's been a client. He has been on our board. And if you remember, he was on the board of this company for 3 years. He has more than a fleeting familiarity with Visa. He is very familiar with the staff at Visa, having interacted with many of them for a number of years. He has run large global operations in the past. And while he's not a technologist, per se, he's run large organizations that depend very significantly on technology. We also, as you remember, have parsed our company in a way where we have focused on technology simultaneous to what we do in our core business. And there has to be a recognition that our core business is the -- is what's feeding this engine and what's creating the revenue and the cash flow that allows us to invest. We have an extremely strong technology organization. We've hired a number of extraordinary individuals over the last 2 or 3 years. We're very, very confident that, that organization has the ability to take -- to continue to take us forward. And, in fact, I think you'd have to admit that vis-\u00e0-vis other companies in our space, we're way out front, and we don't intend to lose that. So thanks for asking the question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just one of the beauties of Visa's business model is kind of the scalability. And just in looking at your operating margin guidance, it seems like we have another year in 2013 of relatively modest operating margin expansion. Could you just talk about the dynamics that kind of preclude that from happening? And then specific -- one just callout or clarification. I was wondering if there was a callout on the other revenue line, because that was up a little bit?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "The -- with regards to operating margin leverage, we have been kicking up the pace of reinvesting, particularly in our growth initiatives that are -- that really won't begin to drive revenue in a meaningful way until 3 and 4 and 5 years out. And you can look at mobile, V.me. And so what we have done up to this point is invest aggressively in new office expansions and deploying more account executives serving clients in country, all of which drive margin expansion, which, as you've noticed, has moved from 46%, which seems like a lifetime ago, up to 60%. And as more of our investment or acquisitions are much more forward-looking, there will be more of a lag between when that'll show up in operating leverage expansion versus pure investment in the core that leverages the -- completely the VisaNet platform. With regards to other revenue, the reserves associated with the release of the FIN 48 expenses that we had recorded associated with the NOPA, a part of that was -- part of those reserves were recorded in other income. And as we released those reserves, they showed up in that column.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Byron, just 2 quick questions on the 2013 guidance. Is there any pricing -- are there any pricing increase assumptions in there? And the second one is just, can you reiterate what you said on marketing? Will we actually see the first half heavier than the second half or just more of a skew compared to 2012, please?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Can you repeat the last question again?", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just the total marketing spend, you called out that the -- you said there would be more of a skew to the first half. Were you talking just total absolute dollars heavier in the first half than the second half? I just wasn't clear on that.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes. So -- yes, let me deal with that one first. There was a -- if you look at the total amount of marketing spend that we incurred in the fourth quarter, it was $271 million. That was 31% of our entire year's marketing budget. And what we have in marketing is a -- this year, is a percentage and dollar weighted much higher to the fourth quarter or to the second half. And on a percentage basis for next year, we expect to see a better balance, a more even -- it won't be 50-50, but there -- it'll be much more in balance between what is spent in the first half and second half. And even though you asked that question in the context of marketing, let me broaden that and say that, that should hold true for our entire operating expenses. We were much more second half weighted this past year than we expect to be in the year to come. And I'm sorry, your first question was?", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "In price increases.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Price increases. I would say that there is very little in the way of pricing built into the coming year. And in fact, we are giving back some effective pricing as a part of our response in the U.S. debit arena. So the revenue growth for next year is going to be delivered the good old-fashioned way, by driving hard against payment volume, not only in the U.S. but in the Rest of World in particular.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to get a general update on the e-commerce business in terms of either your percent of volume or percent of revenue or growth or whatever metrics you can provide? And some color on to what extent V.me can accelerate this and perhaps in which time frame? And then just a quick clarification for Byron. What caused the jump up in other income here in Q4?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "You go first.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Okay. So with regards to other income, this was -- it was principally driven by 2 things. The release of reserves, which are related to the reversal of the NOPA reserves on the IRS situation that clarified itself this past quarter. A part of the -- the vast majority of those reserves are taxes. But when you are put into a situation where you potentially have to pay back taxes, then you have an interest charge. And that's -- that interest charge was the source of the release in reserves that hit that column. In addition, we had some insurance recoveries that occurred that quarter, and that's why those popped up. On the e-commerce, with regards to the percentage of our business, we don't have an update on that for the moment. But this is our fastest-growing channel across the company globally. And within that e-commerce channel, the fastest-growing form factor is mobile. And this is why we have put such emphasis on V.me, which is particularly suited for the mobile form factor, and why we have put such strong focus on mobile strategies that go far beyond NFC and are global in scope.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I got 2 quick ones maybe. Just on the rebate line, that was nicely lower than we expected for the quarter. I'm curious for next year, the line of sight into the 18%, 18.5%, how much of that step-up is sort of signed based on your deals that you've already renewed or recently won versus anticipated deals? Just trying to get a better sense of conservatism versus reality there. And then secondarily on debit, I know there's a little bit of improvement in October. How much of that is paved in -- from the other mitigation strategies versus just macro or new wins? That would be great.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Okay. So on the incentive side, I would say, first of all, that the drivers are almost as much Rest of World contracts that a number of which -- a meaningful increment of which have already been signed and will begin annualizing at a higher incentive rate going into next year. And we've already -- and so that's one major driver of the incentive increase. The other major driver is that we're only 2 quarters into the routing rule changes in U.S. debit. And as a result of that, we've got a building momentum of agreements that we are signing with merchants and acquirers. And that also will -- has yet to annualize in the coming year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Thomas McCrohan of Janney.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Can you expand a little bit about the routing agreements that are still being signed with the merchant community? Just give us a sense of how those are going to be structured and how they're going to be flowing through the income statement?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, what I would say is 2 things. These agreements are very much performance-oriented agreements. They -- for the most part, they only pay out incentives if the volume is delivered. Now I think it's important to emphasize that the agreements, themselves, don't guarantee volume. They incent it. If the volume is there, the incentives will be paid. And if they aren't, they aren't. And so there is -- to a certain extent, there is a degree of variability with regards to how much incentives will be paid out and it will be completely tied to the volume delivered. And then we are still, as I said before, on a path of signing additional merchants with these agreements, so we do expect them to be not only performance-based but to grow in number as the year unfolds. The way these are booked into the income statement is virtually 100% contra-revenue incentives.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question on kind of decomposing the EPS growth rate. I'm understanding where the revenue growth is and the target for the margins. If you think about the buyback that you guys have currently coupled with your lower tax rate, is there some proportions that we should be thinking about in terms of how much of the buyback is built into the EPS growth? And then also the tax rate, I think you say was in the 30% to 32% range, is that correct?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yes. So, Julio, I'm going to let you do the math. What we've done is given you the -- given you all the metrics that we typically give you at this point of time. The -- clearly, there is a dynamic with the double -- low-double-digit revenue growth and the operating margin is -- will be the major contributor. Tax, once again, will allow us to add a little octane to the EPS growth. And then as you have noticed, we're very disciplined repurchases -- repurchasers of our stock over the course of the year. We also have a habit of readdressing the opportunity for buyback at every single board meeting. So today, as we enter into the fiscal -- new fiscal year, we have $865 million of previously authorized but unspent open to buy on share repurchase. We have $1.5 billion new program that was just announced. So that gives us a little over $2.3 billion of open to buy. And then, of course, later in the year, should circumstances warrant, we have the opportunity to go back to the board and ask for additional share repurchase opportunity. Recognize, however, that the later in the year that the share repurchases occur, the corresponding lower impact they will have on a given year's EPS.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Bill Carcache of Nomura.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Joe, some of the U.S. data that we've seen shows a clear consumer preference for PIN over Signature. I wonder if you could comment on whether that's, in fact, what you're seeing as well; and if so, what you attribute that to? And then if you could just kind of share your thoughts on how strategic you see the role of U.S. debit in the context of your suite of payment products, now that it isn't the growth driver that it once was?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So we're -- I suppose we're in a bit of a odd position to comment on this in one sense because with regards to PIN, thanks to a regulatory change, a substantial part of our PIN market share was gifted to our competition. And so it's a little hard for us on the margin to comment on the PIN. However, on the Signature debit, or what we refer to as Visa Debit, I can tell you that our business has, since the implementation of the rules, I think in prior quarters, we have experienced solid mid-single digit growth. And that growth rate is on balance, drifting a little north in the most recent quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. Yes, in terms of the way growth trends are generally playing out in the month of October, MasterCard today indicated growth improvement outside of the U.S., and generally, stability in the U.S. Are you taking somewhat of a more cautious stance on the recent growth trends, or is your view fairly consistent with the way MasterCard characterized it earlier today?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, they have an eloquent way of stating things, as you've mentioned before. But I wouldn't say we're copying MasterCard. I'd say our growth in the United States, particularly in the credit business, which is our highest-yielding business, is significantly stronger than any of our competition, and it continues to grow. And I mentioned that in my remarks earlier. We have strong growth outside of the United States as well. MasterCard deals in Europe, and we don't. They have quite a bit of strength in Europe, but our Asian and Latin American businesses are growing at very robust rates. We continue to believe that we'll have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in a very short period of time. I think that there is tough competition to deal with. I mean, I don't think there's any question about that, but we're doing very well. And in the parts of the world in which we do business, we are competitively advantaged, and we intend to maintain that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just looking at the Rest of World, it was a little bit lower than we expected. I think you mentioned maybe Asia was -- and obviously looking at the numbers, it looked like Asia was a little bit slower. But can you talk about the Rest of World? Was that all economy that's causing the deceleration? Is there any contract losses we should know about? And then secondly, on the international revenue growth, it was a little lower than we expected. Byron, maybe you can just help me through that again because I know cross-border was up 7%, so it's a little bit below cross-border growth. And usually, international revenue growth sometimes is above cross-border.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Okay. So I would say in looking over the Rest of World that there were no contract losses material to speak of. In fact, I can't even think of one. So it's much more economic. And as we look at kind of the cross-border as well as the domestic spend inside the Rest of World countries, both of them put on the brakes a bit. Now recognize, Brian, these are still, for the most part, robust growth rates with that we would love to aspire to here in the United States. But in terms of feeling light there, at least in the fourth quarter, there was a bit of a downshift that's -- I think it's economically driven. And with regards to just -- I know 4 weeks does not a trend make, but October was a bit encouraging as it looks like there was a bit of a bounce back in the month of October as it relates to Rest of World cross-border, as well as Rest of World processed transactions, both of which we have real-time visibility too. With regards to international revenue. Let's see. We had nominal cross-border growth of 7%, and we had international fee growth of 5%. And if I look back over the last 3 or 4 quarters, there is always kind of plus or minus 2 or 3 percentage points of noise. I don't think there is any particular callout as I look at the drivers of international fees. It's just -- so I think we're pretty close to the nominal cross-border growth and no real callouts.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.", "David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I wondered can you just maybe put a little more color on what you're seeing in the way of spending in Asia and the U.S.? Any changes in behavior, consumers or corporate customers in terms of the spending mix plus T&E?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "There has been a clear increase over the year credit spending of more affluent people. A lot of what's going on even in the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending, as I'm sure you know as well or better than I do. And I think that most of these things have exhibited some sustainability. There are different blips in a few countries around the world and in Asia in particular that are associated with specific events. Some of the noise between China and Japan has hurt some of the volume between those 2 countries in the cross-border volume and the payment volume in particular. And there have been other examples of similar situations. On the bias, though, things are proceeding as well as we expected given the overriding macroeconomic situation. And we're very happy where we wound up in 2012, including the fourth quarter, and we'll have to go from there. As Byron said earlier and as I said, we can't totally avoid what's going on in the global economy. But I think that the -- we're certainly positioned to do well next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My question relates specifically to V.me, and I recognize that it's early days. You gave some very encouraging information earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe provide some insight as to what you think it will take to close the gap on the remaining top 10 issuers? And separately, if you think that either 2013 guidance already incorporates some of the pickup in spending on V.me, or if you think that's really more of a 2014 and forward event, please.", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, the answer to the last part of the question first, I think, is more of a 2014 event. I mean, going back to the Internet, there were $327 billion spent on the -- or, excuse me, there was $226 billion spent in 2012. People expect that to move to $327 billion by 2016, which I mentioned in my earlier comments. We have a extraordinarily significant share of that volume. It is the fastest-growing category we have without V.me. And I think V.me will enable us to increase our share of the transactions. So not only are we going to be dealing in a category that's increasing, and even though that category may be taking some sales away from in-store sales, I think we will get a larger share of those sales than we have in the past. Any time you do something like we're doing with V.me, it's a chicken-and-egg kind of a thing. What comes first, all the merchants or all the customers? We're running at a pretty rapid rate as it relates to putting both on, and I think we'll have a successful start-up this holiday season. I think that by the middle of the year, we will have a much more robust environment. And by the -- and by a year from now, we'll be poised to take significant advantage of what we've done. As it relates to closing the gap in the top 10, I don't like to speak for my customers before they speak for themselves. But I am looking forward to and I think you could legitimately look forward to hearing a lot more about new additions in the very near future.", "Operator", "Our final question will be from Craig Maurer of CLSA.", "Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Couple of questions. One, are there any unique or specific profit aspirations for V.me other than gaining share in e-commerce? And secondly, decoupled debit, TSYS commented that their fastest-growing debit customer now is a decoupled debit customer. And it's pretty clear to us that the MCX merchants are going to launch with decoupled debits. So my question is, has something changed in decoupled debits since Capital One failed at that attempt 2 years ago that would make you a bit more nervous of that product?", "Joseph W. Saunders", "Well, I don't think anything that I'm aware of has happened that should precipitate that. And, of course, that failed because they couldn't bundle transactions. They had to have specific -- they had to be able to specifically list each transaction, which they were unable to do. As it relates to MCX, I mean, I think they have lofty aspirations, and they probably have a lot of horsepower to work with. I think we're aware of what we're doing, and -- I mean, we're aware of what they're doing, and they're aware of what we're doing. And we're working hard to compete. And I don't think that, that in itself is going to define who Visa is or isn't in the near- or the moderate-term.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, all, for your participation today.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon and welcome to Visa Inc\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us today are Charles W.

I just want to start by letting everyone know how excited I\u2019m to be part of Visa. After 10 years as some combination of an issue or a member of the Board, its great to be part of a team that I\u2019ve known for 10 years or so. And especially Byron and his team, whom I\u2019m going to embarrass him a little bit, he is even more impressive from inside the Company than he was from outside the Company as well as the team.", "I do feel lucky to be part of what clearly is a growth Company and a growth industry. These times are exciting. We got some great competition out there, both from traditional players and from new players. But as I\u2019m going to talk a little bit here in the call, we love our position.", "Well first, we\u2019re going to go through the quarter, which as you saw was very, very strong. And then even more importantly, I think once we go beyond that I\u2019m going to talk a little bit more about our continued strong investment in the future of the Company. And it's our confidence in that you can see is exhibited by the additional share repurchase authorization that\u2019s in today\u2019s announcement.", "So Byron, going to walk through the quarter and then I\u2019ll come back and give you some more detail thoughts and leave plenty time for Q&A at the end.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank you, Charlie. As its my practice, I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, Visa\u2019s 12% net revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter was once again broad based as we continue to see strong credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of World, as well as a return to positive growth in our worldwide debit business.", "Second, client incentives for the quarter. As a percentage of growths revenue, we\u2019re 16.3% and below our full-year guidance. This was a result of both lower than expected deal activity in the quarter and timing issues associated with incentives to certain clients. We expect these payments to be realized in the coming quarters.", "Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume posted a negative 4% growth rate in the fiscal first quarter of 2013 versus a negative 6% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012. Of note, Q1 Interlink payment volume growth was off 44% versus 48% in the September ending quarter.", "Fourth, Visa\u2019s effective tax rate of 28.2% was positively impacted by a tax benefit recognized during the quarter as a result of new guidance issued by the State of California regarding apportionment rules. As a result we booked a credit of $76 million after tax representing about a $0.11 of EPS, which resulted in a significantly reduced tax rate for the quarter. This catch-up benefit is consistent with our full-year tax and EPS guidance.", "Fifth, in wake of receiving preliminary court approval of the merchant litigation settlement agreement in December, we made a $4 billion cash payment from Visa's litigation escrow account to the Class Plaintiffs' settlement fund. This was in addition to $350 million paid out in October to the individual merchants. The net result of these payments will be to increase our free cash flow by about $1.6 billion this year, given our ability to deduct these payments from our U.S. tax return.", "Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders with a new $1.75 billion share repurchase program. To put this in perspective, during the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion to repurchase 9 million shares at an average price of about $145. At the end of fiscal Q1, we had 1.1 billion of remaining authorization to which we added the 1.75 billion bringing our total open to buy to just under $3 billion.", "Our priorities for the use of this cash remain the same. First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisitions and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal first quarter followed by our results through January 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013.", "Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 9%, up from the September quarter's 6%. More recently in the U.S. through January 28, payment volume growth was 5% compared with 3% in the December ending quarter. Both U.S. credit and debit experienced improved growth rates.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, which compares to a 10% rate in the September quarter. The U.S. grew 9%; rest of world 11%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Through January 28, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 12% with the U.S. growth rate of 10%, rest of world at 12%.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14.2 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a 4% increase over the prior year period. A 4% decline in U.S. debit transactions was offset by a positive 21% growth in debit and credit in the rest of world. Note that as we begin to lap the impact of changes in U.S. debit regulations, we expect our U.S. debit metrics to show improved results.", "Consistent with that dynamic through January 28, processed transaction growth was a positive 6% driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 28% increase over the prior period.", "Now let's turn to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues and as mentioned earlier lower than anticipated client incentives. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. Revenue growth exceeded constant dollar payment volume growth of 6% largely due to the decline in Interlink, a debit product that does not generate service revenues.", "Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions outside the U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market.", "International transaction revenue was up 8% to $805 million, reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16.3% lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of deals and certain incentive payments.", "In future quarters we anticipate a step up in incentive levels as a percentage of gross revenue consistent with our full-year guidance expectations of 18% to 18.5%. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior-year. This was primarily due to higher personnel and professional fees associated with investments in our growth strategies.", "Marketing expenses were up a modest 2% from the prior-year as the first half of the year tends to be our quietest and will ramp up over the year in line with our guidance of under $1 billion for fiscal 2013. Operating margin for the quarter was 63%, well slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60, this margin level is consistent with how we planned for the year. As noted earlier, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 28.2%. The lower rate for the quarter was primarily due to a favorable clarification in the apportionment rules for the State of California. The resulting benefit was related to prior periods. That said, the Q1 tax rate is fully consistent with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%.", "Finally, capital expenditures were a $100 million in the quarter in line with our full-year expectations. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal first quarter totaled $669 million. Other than the change in free cash flow guidance to about $6 billion, there are no other changes to our fiscal guidance.", "And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Thanks a lot Byron. I thought maybe what I would do being new to the Company is start by just talking about my view of the Company, the way I think about it, and then move into priorities. And I guess, I\u2019d frame my thoughts on the Company by starting off with the fact that having been here for three months and been around the world spending time with people here, I am more bullish today about the opportunities that we have than the day I joined. And I think that\u2019s true about the short-term and the long-term, and let me just go through some reasons why.", "First of all, as you all know the resiliency of the business model really is something pretty special. Everyone is aware of the global economic environment, the conditions that we have been working through. The important thing for us is that we continue to have the ability to deliver through the economic cycle.", "Second of all, and I wouldn\u2019t underestimate this issue which is that, there\u2019s a clear desire and a need for our product both socially and economically. And when you travel around the world it comes through loud and clear. Our products help economies grow and they help people of all wealth levels, as well as merchants and governments of all sizes. And again especially once you leave the United States as you talk to the governments, as you talk to merchant\u2019s that is the message that we get loud and clear.", "And then we also can\u2019t forget about this huge number of 2.5 billion people across the world that don\u2019t have access to the formal financial system today. And our products that we offer can bring them into it. It really is something overtime that will improve their lives and improve the economies in the countries that they live in and help advance those countries. And obviously as you\u2019ve seen from things like Rwanda and some other stuff we\u2019ll talk about those great government interest in doing that.", "Third, there's a strong secular trend that's clear. This continued growth in electronification of payments which we\u2019ve been living through is going to continue. Importantly, the way we think about it here first and foremost we compete with cash and checks. After that we compete with others in the market place, but there\u2019s so much cash and check across the globe is still somewhat astonishing and even more astonishing the price getting bigger. There\u2019s more cash today than there was five years ago. And so this is just obviously a great opportunity for us in the market that we play in.", "Fourth, we have an enviable competitive position. You all know the share numbers, but it's just not share. It's the relationships that we have across the globe. It's the fact that we're a trusted partner in the payments industry, because of both \u2013 what our brand is but also what we've actually delivered over a long period of time here. And again, when you go outside of the United States, the power of the brand just, it's something that people talk about over and over again.", "And those opportunities outside of the United States are exciting. That's the fifth reason that I put in the bullish category because we've got huge opportunity in both developed and less developed countries outside the United States and I'll talk a little more of that in a second. The quality of the people at Visa across the globe is terrific. This company has been built by the people that have been here and it's great to be able to work even more closely with them.", "And then the last thing I'll just talk about here is just our network for a second. I'm not sure we spend enough time talking about it, but it's obviously the core of who we are. But we have one global network and just a perspective of coming from outside the company very few global companies out there can say that they have one network across the globe. It's efficient, it's controlled, it's a great platform. And so to the extent we want to do things and scale them across the world, we can do them in a way that a lot of other industries would really struggle to do.", "The networks been built over decades. We all know that it provides great global acceptance, clearing, authorization and settlement, but it's proven to be safe and secure. It's battletested through the years as though I think about it and we continue to invest aggressively because the world of cyber criminals is growing not shrinking, and I'd rather have our network than anyone else's at this point as we continue to build on that security. And this becomes a competitive advantage over time.", "But beyond just the core capabilities of our network, the real differentiation for us is how we use it for our participants. And I think about our participants, issuers, acquirers, cardholders and merchants in this category. We have been and will continue to drive more functionality to benefit our customers. That's risk management, that's marketing, it's offers, it's things like that and we'll continue to extend access to the network and that's a big part of what our mobile activities are. And as long as we continue to do that, our network is far from a commodity.", "So moving to priorities for a second, I think it's totally appropriate to be clear that my first priority is to make sure that we continue this momentum here. The quarter speaks for itself. The past few quarters \u2013 not few, the past quarters over an extended period of time here say an awful lot about the momentum that this company has. I could go through a long list of wins right now in the quarter, I'm not going to do that, I'm not sure we all get benefit from that. What I'd rather do is just focus on some examples of some interesting things that we're doing across the globe.", "First example is Saral Money. It's a partnership with five leading clients, the Delhi state government and the Indian national identity system that links the national ID number with biometric information to provide instant authentication and complete a paperless process to open a bank account and issue a Visa debit or prepaid card instantly. It's terrific, it's in-market and something we're very excited about.", "We also announced a strategic agreement with QIWI. QIWI is Russia's leading payment services provider. They provides digital wallet to more than 9 million active Russian customers who use them at more than hundred thousand cash kiosks. What our agreement really is all about is transitioning the wallet from a single bank model to a digital wallet with stored value account based upon Visa prepaid cards that can be issued by any Visa client bank. It will be a great product to have alongside our own product.", "And then the country of Myanmar, we're bringing electronic payments to the country. We enabled the first credit card payment through Visa-branded wireless point-of-sale terminal and now credit debt in prepaid cards are able to be used in selected merchants. Another great example of the momentum that we have is V.me, our electronic wallet. I know you've heard about it, but it's actually -- it's real, it's live, it's in the market.", "At the end of 2012, we had 31 merchant sites live. We have an additional 132 signed up through yesterday, I believe, and we have 63 issuers who have signed up to participate. Those issuers represent 55 million Visa cards, includes so far 12 of the top 25 U.S. banks, 51 U.S. regional banks and PNC and Bank of America have integrated V.me into their online banking websites. So I could go on about more things, but I thought I just turn out to some of the strategic priorities as I see them.", "First and probably foremost is the continue to extend the electronification of payments. Its obvious, but the pie is so big here, the more we do its good for all. For us to be able to do that, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to be more flexible. This organization got great history with great results, but if you go around and talk to issuers, acquirers, merchants, we can be a little too rules oriented and so we\u2019ve got to figure out how we become less focused on rules, while preserving what\u2019s important to keep the integrity of our network in place. By doing things like that, we can work with our customers to create more customized solutions and support issuers of all sizes. Not a small opportunity for us, its I think a big opportunity for us to partner more closely with our customers.", "Next I would put the second biggest strategic priority, technology and innovation were generally. Again, my perspective here having, participated with the Company for a period of time is just great progress. Three years ago when I was still on the Board, there was very, very little going on here relative to using these new technologies to benefit us. It was still up the tail end of taking the Company public merging the entities and whatnot, and over the past three years the progress has been really terrific. I talked about V.me, again, its not an idea, its in the market today.", "The work on mobile here continues, both organically and with the acquisition of Fundamo. It\u2019s a critical access point to a network and continued investment in that is absolutely critical for us. As we think about these capabilities and thinking about things that we do our \u2013 again, our focus is on extending the core network and access some capabilities of that network. We love the business we\u2019re in, we integrate business, that\u2019s the core of who we are to the network, its processing and the things that we\u2019re going to focus on will continue to be those things that support those core assets.", "We\u2019re also going to continue to be completely focused on supporting our customers, and those are; it's the issuers and the acquirers and ultimately the card holders and the merchants, but it's through those \u2013 through our customers. We have no intention of disintermediating them. It's, they\u2019re too important for us and too much of an opportunity. And as we think about these technology investments and whatnot, the way, I have to think about it is, the more we work with our customers on these things, we teller our investments both with them and for them as we talk to them. We move to more of a partnership orientation as opposed to a vendor relationship.", "People when you go, when you talk to people about our business, you can think about it two different ways. You can think about it as if, which we do know there are other people that do what we do with that core asset that we have. And one way to approach that from the outside is to look at it and say, who\u2019s the cheapest price out there? But in anything, no matter what you do in life there\u2019s always a cheaper price out there; and our job is to make sure that we provide more value and whether it's through the relationship building, whether it's through helping people marketing, whether it's using their data, using their information, building things like V.me, building mobile. All those things that we do create more value, and so that people look at us much more of a partner than a vendor over time.", "Third priority, international growth, again not something new, you\u2019ve heard about this quite a bit. We\u2019ve got an off a lot going on. It is also, I think it's important to say. We love the United States. We love our position in the United States. We've got some really neat stuff going on here. So, it's not to say otherwise, but it's hard not to look at what the opportunity is outside the U.S. and say it's just large. It's all across the world. Here too it's booked short-term and long-term. Its large developed markets where there are big cash based economies like Japan, and there are merging market all over the world with very little acceptance as I\u2019ve referred to earlier.", "We\u2019re investing aggressively here. We\u2019re opening new offices and adding people in country. In 2012 we opened six new offices, 17 expansions and more to come this year. We\u2019re growing acceptance. We\u2019re expanding cyber source globally. We're working closely with governments. It's a huge part of the effort to partner with governments, to push electronification of payments. And country by country, we've got very, very specific and very different strategies. Some parts of the world, NFC through payWave is extremely important in places like Canada and Australia and the products we have are extremely helpful to us in building our business there. Other places, its traditional debit, credit and prepaid. And other places we know the importance of mobile. So we're going to continue to invest here and take advantage of the large opportunity that we all know exists.", "The next priority, number four, I would talk about merchant relationships. This is one where we provide great value for merchants. I absolutely believe that. And you've got examples like Square-type technology and pricing on those products out there which just shows you that people -- small merchants are willing to pay to electronify their world because they know how difficult and how expensive cash is.", "Having said that, we also have to acknowledge that it's on us along with our issuers and acquirers that we do business with to prove to merchants day-in and day-out. Some believe it, and I've had conversations with plenty of merchants that think we do a great job partnering with them, but obviously there are an awful lot which are very vocal that don't believe that here in the United States, and again that's on us to figure out how to change the nature of that relationship.", "So we need to do a whole lot more. It starts with engaging them very differently. I'm not talking about the courts through D.C., I'm talking about directly. We need to balance their issues with others in our value chain. It's just an extremely important concept that needs to permeate the way we think about our business. And most importantly, it's up to us to prove to them that we can actually help them grow.", "We talk about this internally that Visa cardholders are the largest single source of potential spend in the world. And to the extent that we can work with merchants, again, through our issuers and acquirers and show them how we can add value to them in building their businesses, that's what we've got to do to change the nature of our relationship. And so we will be doing a lot more of that.", "Employees, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about employees as a priority because this is a business based upon the quality of the people that we have. We've got a great group of people here across the globe who I've gotten to know and it's my job to continue to create the most attractive environment, so we've got the best, the smartest and most vibrant thinking in this company.", "Sixth, capital allocation and if you're sitting on the edge of your seat for something new, you're not going to get it. The company historically and I \u2013 I'd say first of all have great respect for the responsibility. We understand what it means and we understand what shareholders want. And as Byron has said in the past, our jobs are to put capital to use intelligently or return it to you and that's been a consistent theme since the IPO. Intelligently means investing it in our core assets, organically or through acquisitions like you've seen us do. But obviously if we don't see those opportunities, then we're going to return it to you through dividends and buybacks.", "We're going to always prioritize what we're going to do based upon the returns for the shareholder and our goal is to reward shareholders that continue to own the stock. So, again, it's something that is hopefully a whole lot of consistency with my thinking and with the thinking that's been here.", "And then the last priority I'll end with is the continuing open dialogue that Visa has had with the investor community. I certainly look forward to getting to know all of you. I know some of you. I look forward to getting to know many more of you, sharing my thoughts, our thoughts in more detail. And to that end, just so you know, we're working on planning of an Investor Day which we're going to firm up the timing and Jack will be back to you with the specifics relatively quickly on that.", "So before we open it for Q&A, let me just start by saying a couple of things here. I hope you get the sense as I talk about how I feel about the opportunity here that the runway for growth is long and it's deep. As we think about what we do here, we've got to balance the short and the long term. And what that means is there is no long when you think about a short term, so we know we must deliver. But when people hear -- people like to ask the generic question of how you define success five years now?", "To me, it's really all about -- we feel great about the opportunity for the next five years, but success is going to be that we're sitting here five years from now and we feel as good about the forward-looking growth as we do today. And if that doesn't happen, shame on us because we've got the assets and we've got the business to do that. And we are confident that we will do it.", "So with that, I will stop and Byron and I are here to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks and Charlie welcome abroad. I appreciate all the comments. Just wanted to pick up on one of the things you said in terms of Visa potentially becoming a little bit less rules oriented going forward. And I think you kind of elaborate on there and how soon we might see this? And then Byron, if you can just give us a quick clarification on the tax rate issue. It sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that you guys already had anticipated this tax benefit when you give the 30% to 32% full-year tax rate guidance and the high-teen VPS guidance for last quarter is that accurate?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Why don\u2019t I start on the tax rate, that\u2019s correct, your tax rate is always comprised of components. This was a component that the timing of which uncertain. But this type of component was contemplated and as a result it\u2019s fully consistent with the guidance we gave at the end of last quarter.", "Charles W. Scharf", "And Jason I will take the question on flexibility. I think \u2013 the way to think about that one is \u2013 again, if you go around and you talk to issuers across the globe and if you talk to merchants and if you ask what is the negative quality of these, hopefully after they go the long list of positives, they will talk about that we\u2019re not as flexible as we could be, we got lots and lots of rules. And so what that means is they tend to get nervous that we can just change rules. They\u2019re not sure about how that might impact them in the future. And our goal should be that we got rules that protect the integrity and the value of our payments network. That\u2019s why they were put in place to begin with and they\u2019ve just grown over a period of time. So, what we have to do is \u2013 as the Company evolves it has become much more commercial figure, define the rules as those things that are quote \u2018who we\u2019re\u2019 and the protection of the value of our networks I described and then move other things into commercial arrangements that you would have with customers.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Hi, and let me add my congratulations on your first quarter with Visa. You talked earlier about the importance of a global network, but Visa is a separate entity from V.me \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, from Visa Europe, V.me well. Anyway Visa Europe and I wanted your thoughts on how long-term Visa Europe plays into the global strategy?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah, listen, I mean yeah, I\u2019m sure you guys have talked for five years about the status of Visa Europe and the put and what not. I would say; we have a very close working relationship with Visa Europe. You are right to say that from a European perspective it's a separate system, but it's interoperable. But when we go to market, we work extremely closely with them, so that when customers deal with Visa, it is up to us to figure out how to coordinate with them. I\u2019ve spent time with some of our big global customers and the feedback is; it works well. There are other customers that like to deal with us as separate entities just as they would if we were one big company, would you design a company like this? No. But it's a fact of life and the puts the put and there\u2019s nothing more to say about it.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research", "Hi, good evening. Charlie, I look forward to working with you. I\u2019m just trying to get my hands around what Visa\u2019s strategy might look like as technology changes the industry; and Charlie how far do you think Visa might stray from it's historical role if exclusively a network in the middle, and by this I mean, developing more consumer facing initiatives like V.me. And then how would you reconcile this strategy with those of your constituent partners who often times are pursuing these same strategies so there could be some, your competitive or brand conflict there? Thank you.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah. We\u2019re here to support the customers of our issuers and acquirers. That\u2019s the way we think about it. That\u2019s the way things are built here and that\u2019s the way things will continue to be build. So, something like V.me, we're building V.me on behalf of our customers. If you go use V.me, you will have to register for it so that your information gets in there. But from that point forward, it is completely supportive of our banks. When you pay for something using V.me, we have the ability to show the card art exactly as it exists in someone's wallet today. So, V.me is not meant to be direct to consumer to go around our issuers, it's actually just the opposite. It's meant to support them with the electronic wallet that will enable them to continue to grow commerce.", "So as we think about \u2013 I want to talk about extending who we are, we love the business that we're in. Presumably, you all love the business that we're in which is why we trade the way we do. And so we're very mindful of that. And the opportunities for us to continue to figure out how to use technology whether it's our own or whether it's other peoples, to feed that network and to use our assets is what we're focused on.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.", "Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Thanks. So I just want to return to this issue of capital allocation and I know that you said there's not much of a change. But I was thinking more in terms of the first priority is always back into the business and I heard you mention in your kind of prepared remarks around priorities and others, outside the U.S. a number of times. So I'm wondering if you could just shed some light without being too specific, I suspect on kind of how we should be thinking about capital redeployment through this geographic mix that you guys have? Thank you.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "I'll start. So I would say the first call on the growth in our capital is going to be software development that underpins our new products in mobile, V.me or right on the point of the sphere with that. That would support products that were to be deployed both in the United States and in rest of world and the development of those products, the actual incurring of the capital would also actually occur both in the United States and outside.", "As you build additional product capability and extension of the services we offer, that will also require investment in infrastructure. Now just the capacity to house, to operate and to process, but also new challenges like security. So VisaNet very, very formidable battletested defenses as you start moving into products that are going to start operating as an extension outside of VisaNet, but it requires additional investment in technologies in order to properly secure.", "And so that is the primary source of hard dollar capital. And then as Charlie mentioned, we still have an enormous runway of growth in our base business. So we are adding offices, we are expanding, we are putting more people on the ground. We are at our best when we have people deployed in country giving personalized, tailored service to our clients, banks, acquirers, merchants. And so that reinvestment will not just be capital expenditure, it will also be operating expense with an immediate return in the core business.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me just add to what Byron said. If you just look at relative levels and just get my own view coming in from the outside is there's a lot of investment that's going on here. You see it in the expense line. You see it in the initiatives. You see \u2013 I mean you don't get to [work] with something like V.me without putting the resources into it or being able to be in the market with mobile, without having used the capital on something like Fundamo and whatnot. So, there is a significant level of investment going on with what you see and it still allows us to do what we've done with the dividend and with the repurchase program here. So, we feel like there's just plenty of room for all of those things.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. Charlie, so with your experience on the bank side, are there tangible steps for you to make \u2013 to help Visa improve its relationship with the banks, particularly the large banks. For instance, as you push new products like V.me, you need the large banks on board, and so far it\u2019s unclear to what extent the largest banks are fully supportive at this point. It\u2019s helpful to hear that 12 of the top 25 banks are signed up for V.me, but that could imply that 13 of 25 are not signed up at least at this point; and so that\u2019s one example. But on that example and Visa\u2019s general relationship with large banks, are there tangible steps to take to better engage with the banks? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah, I guess, let me answer it a couple of ways. I mean, to just \u2013 listen, we can always improve relationships, so that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, but I will come back to that. I said 12 with the top 25; we have four of the top 10, who are already signed up for it. And again, when you say large banks, the Bank of America is a great partner of ours. PNC is a great partner of ours. U.S. Bank is a great partner of ours. TD Bank is great partner, I mean, I can go on through the names. We have a great list of partners that are currently signed up for it.", "I spent a bunch of time myself talking to the biggest banks in this country, but just so you know I don't spend all my time thinking about the biggest banks in this country, the big banks here are important, but so are the regional banks, so are the credit unions, so are the community banks, just as the banks overseas. So, I just want to be clear about that. But listen, we have \u2013 you go through the relationships that we have with the big U.S. banks and it\u2019s hard to say you trade our position with anyone\u2019s in the marketplace. And is that something we have to earn every day? Absolutely.", "Are things like V.me, things that actually solidify those relationships? Absolutely. There is a lot more that we\u2019re doing working in partnership with banks of all sizes to create that partnership orientation away from a vendor orientation. We view it as something that it's not a god given right, we got to earn it every day. But again just to end where I started is we\u2019ve got relationships with these banks. We don't take them for granted, but like anything else, we work \u2013 we come in everyday to figure out how do we make them better?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan", "Hey, great. Thanks, Charlie. Welcome to the call. Just thinking about your initiatives being more flexible partnering and customizing. I\u2019m curious, to accomplish this do you foresee more investments required to get there or that was in place? And I also wanted to ask just about, your comment about working closer with the merchants. I know Visa has been moving closer to the merchant for some time and given your background from the issuer side. How much closer can Visa get to the merchant before you, I guess, complicate the issue of relationship, if you follow up question?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me do that one first. I\u2019m not at all worried, did I say worried, I always worry to the extent of, we all should be careful and clear. So, just assume that\u2019s the case. But in my conversations with issuers, we all agree because they\u2019re in the exact same spot. And I speak as much from where I came from as where I am, that we all need to do a better job of working with merchants. Our customers are merchants and acquirers. We\u2019ve got that. We understand that. But ultimately there\u2019s someone who uses the payment product, and there\u2019s someone that accepts the payment product. And if the person that accepts the payment product is not particularly happy, that\u2019s not a good thing for us. And that\u2019s not a good thing for the issuers either. So, we are in total alignment on changing the nature of those relationships where they\u2019re wanted. And it's something that we do -- that we\u2019re working on in partnership with them, as well as partnership with the acquirers. We've had very open conversations with the acquirers about that. I was just with them, with all the big acquirers this past weekend, and they\u2019re totally supportive of it. So, I\u2019m not -- again assuming that we do this openly, the right kind of way. I think we\u2019re all in this together. And your first \u2013 the first part of the question.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yeah, Charles I\u2019ll take the first one. So, the first question I think Tien-Tsin was more about in our effort to be -- have more tailored and flexible client relationships, do we expect this -- is that going to cost more in terms of capital? And I would say, at the current point in time, the big capital is in creating the products and in the capabilities that allow you to operate and leverage a large network, and that today, is there expense involved in tailoring? Yes. But we don\u2019t have line of sight to larger expense.", "And a good example of that would be our strategy of recognizing, as Charlie said earlier, that the single largest open to buy on the planet is the Visa cardholder's access through our network. Hence, part of our strategy is to build products that can be accessed through our network with common stacked APIs that make it very easy for users or our clients to hook into the network. So, in the spirit of how we're expending our capital, I would say over the next several years its past is much more a representative of prologue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Brendler of Stiefel Nicolaus. Your line is open.", "Christopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc., Research Division", "Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wondered if you could just give us any color on the progress you're making with Interlink, any sense of how much success you're having with PAVD and actually getting transactions routed over that signature Visa Network on the debit side, as well as any update there may be on the FANF fee? And then maybe for Charlie along with the FANF fee, is there anything in that comment you made about being closer to the merchant and working with the merchant that would make future implementations of fees like this go a little more smoothly? Thanks.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Let me take that one to start to on Interlink. If you go back to the third fiscal quarter of 2012, that was the quarter April 1, was when the dual network Durbin requirement became effective that was high tide in terms of Interlink payment volume loss. So, our growth rate in that third quarter was minus 54. If you then move to the fourth quarter, so that's the fourth fiscal September ending quarter, the growth rate for Interlink was minus 48. If you then move to Q1, so the December ending quarter, were minus 44. And so these -- clearly, we're going to have one other kind of major quarter of transaction loss through Interlink, because it takes four quarters to lap the Durbin effect, but you can see 54, 48, 44, there is progress.", "Having said that, there is going to be -- as we said all along, there is going to be a significant permanent transaction loss as a result of the Durbin regulations. And so while we would expect to continue to make some progress, there is no way we're going to get back to where we were before. And then as I had mentioned in my remarks, once we get into that third fiscal quarter, then the growth rate picture should start looking very different with regards to our debit business, because we're now lapping Durbin.", "With regards to PAVD, PAVD is up and operating. It's important to note that a transaction that is a PAVD transaction actually shows up in our Visa debit payment volume not Interlink. And so PAVD is up and operating. You should think about it at best contributing very modestly to our payment volume growth in U.S. debit.", "And with regards to FANF, and remember FANF is one part of a much more comprehensive fee restructuring, which was combined with a lowering of our per transaction cost, in addition to the introduction of merchant incentives to encourage routing, which is still on the upward ramp. FANF has now been in place since the April quarter. And so far it seems to be going well. Charlie, do you want to add anything?", "Charles W. Scharf", "I guess the only thing I'd add is, listen, I think it's unfair and it's hard to try and stick yourself into the position of someone else when you're going through what this company was going through. And so, I have not personally sat and gone through exactly what happened, what was the thought, what were the options, I mean all the things that you would do to answer your question directly, I haven't done because I'm looking at the future here.", "But as I said, I think as we -- and I think we're all in the same page internally on this one is just as we look forward which is the important thing here, I mean it's about balancing everyone's issues and it's balancing issuers, it's balancing those with merchants, with acquirers, with our own. And we're going to be very, very conscious of that. We're going to do the right thing whether it creates noise or not, but make sure that everyone's represented in that discussion before we make a decision.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Don Fandetti - Citigroup", "Good evening. Charlie I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you view sort of the longer term threat from China UnionPay? And then maybe talk a bit about how you see the sort of opportunity in China playing out and what your approach will be to that market?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Sure. I was in China, I don\u2019t know two or three weeks ago and had the opportunity to meet with a couple of senior members in the government with some of our big clients with China UnionPay and do some, and participate in some other activities that we\u2019re involved in socially there. China is an interesting place for sure, we\u2019re over there. We make money there and we have got some great partners there. The WTO ruling speaks for itself. Over time that market will evolve and will change and we feel like it\u2019s important for us to be a good partner to people within the country to bring the benefits of Visa to China.", "In my conversations with people there, they want us there. They think we can add value not just because of the brand, but because of what our network is versus maybe what China UnionPay is today. And we\u2019d hope over a period of time that we can work with China UnionPay in the context of the way the regulations exist today and as that market changes and evolves. We will figure out how we can do more inside that country, just as they look beyond that country as they develop. But again, I come back to what we have. Our network has been around for a long time. We\u2019ve got 2 billion cards? That\u2019s the number? 2 billion cards outstanding. The largest open-to-buy, the quality of the fraud tools, I mean, I can go on and on about what our network has, and if there is another competitor out there, so be it. Good competition is a good thing, not a bad thing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Charlie, when you think about investment in the business aside from products and so forth. How do you think about market share, I think particularly in the U.S. which is the most mature market in which you operate from an electronic payment standpoint; and should we consider an effort to bolster share both on credit and debit as a central component of the investments going forward as well?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah. So listen, I said this before, which is, our number one opportunity is cash. So, we\u2019re constantly -- the first thing we look at when we think about share is we think about the share of cash versus electronic payments. And it's our goal, it's our mission, it's what we do for a living is to move that number towards electronification. For all the reasons I talked about, it's just -- it's the right thing and it's a good thing for all the participants in the market place.", "And so, I know everyone likes to always ask questions, I mean, even my old job; they used to ask how you compete against the other competitors out there? We've got great competitors. They are doing some neat things. They are smart people. So, I think first and foremost given the market we\u2019re in, there\u2019s plenty of room for a bunch of us to be successful here. And so, that is -- the enemy first and foremost is cash. When you look at how we\u2019re doing versus competitors; we looked pretty good; pretty happy with it.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Tim, if you\u2019re there; you\u2019re on mute. Can\u2019t hear you.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities", "Sorry about that. Thanks for pointing that out. Can you hear me now?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yes.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities", "Yeah. So, on the regulatory front, as you\u2019ve traveled the world, it sounds like over the last several months. Could you give us your thoughts on what kind of regulatory and political environment that you have to navigate; how you think that would impact the economics of your emerging market growth versus how your economics look in the more established markets and if you\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised or find out to be more challenging as you assess what you\u2019ve heard over the last couple of months globally?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah, I would say -- first of all, it's very different in different parts of the world. And so, you obviously know about the U.S, you\u2019ve read about Canada, you know about Australia presumably, and really is different depending on where you are. Again, I alluded to this in lots of my remarks when we started, but I was really positively taken aback by the desire for government officials to want us to be in the market committed to helping electronify their payments.", "It doesn't mean that they're not concerned about interchange or they're not concerned about figuring out what they want in country versus not. I mean different countries have different points of view on that. But they want us to be a participant. They see the value in that. And again, this is not -- this wasn't me going around the world trying to sell our services. This was me going to meet people and as part of that, the clear message to me was we want you here. And when you're in that kind of situation, that's a pretty good place to be in. Byron, anything you want to add?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "It is a wonderful dynamic. There are always two doors in the government. The first door is always open with an open invitation. You can't tax what you can't see. Hence, there's a very strong motivation for governments to be very interested engaged partners. And then I would say the other piece is our position and others when we get deeply involved in the electronification of payment, we become an important part of the monetary system or can be in a country.", "And that's why in virtually every major market we have government relations representatives, we engage early, we educate, we lay good groundwork so that these dialogues are constructive and increase the probability of a good reinforcing regulatory environment as we lay the foundation for growing in the domestic markets of these emerging markets.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.", "Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Thank you and welcome Charlie. Your bar is a lot higher than Joe's was. Your stock's trading at 21 times earnings, his was nowhere near that when he started. So, given that bar and given that this looks like such a great story even just why the valuation has done what it has, what do you view? What are you most worried about? What are the biggest risks? What can derail this train? Is it something like a PayPal offline and MCX, other countries like India, RuPay going the way of China UnionPay? What are you most worried about, what can derail this, what has been a great story so far?", "Charles W. Scharf", "So let me just go through a couple of thoughts. First of all, I would say focus, knowing -- being clear who our clients are and not isn't extremely important. We get a lot of pressure from a lot of people to use our assets to go do things and whatnot. And so my comments around knowing that our clients are the issuers and the acquirers is extremely important. We change the nature of those relationships. We put a lot of money in jeopardy at this place and potential future growth.", "Regulation and legislation clearly has been a big issue for the industry. We're very, very conscious of it. You can't be here and not be. Hopefully, some of the things I talked about when I talked about the priorities, over time with things that get to those issues, because ultimately if you've got the people who are participating in the payment system wanting to do business with you, as opposed to the opposite, then you don't get some of the pressures that you see.", "Again, competition is competition. I mean there's some great competition out there. I wouldn't trade our position with other people. It doesn't mean that we don't think about them, it doesn't mean that people don't do some really smart things, that we sit there and we say why them and not us, that's always the case in every business. But hopefully, they're sitting there and thinking more so of us. So, we spend a lot of time talking about both the traditional and the non-traditional people. So for sure we worry about it, but ultimately that one -- as sitting here today, we feel like we're in a good place.", "Jack Carsky", "Brad, at this point we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions. I guess, Charlie, on the strategy, how do you feel about the risk of being dis-intermediated either through ACH or through another player especially as we move into more of a mobile world? And then secondly for Byron, just the rest of world payment volumes kind of spiked in the quarter. Just curious to know if that was supplemented by some new wins that pushed that number higher. Thanks so much.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Sure. On dis-intermediation I talk about competitors, traditional, non-traditional and that encompasses a wide range of people. So, again we think about it. We worry about it. What we hope people would look at over a period of time, and what we think people look at over a period of time is, our assets that we have here is really hard to build. It just is. The global connectivity, the acceptance that we have, the actual network the way I described it, and other people have other assets out there that they bring to the party. And, what we should be doing, and are doing, and will do more of is engaging with that community to figure out how they can get access to our network in a way which is friendly to our customers because, ultimately it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to go build something that we already have. It doesn\u2019t mean people won't try. It doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t tried in the past. But again, I keep kind of saying this; it's up to us to prove to people why our asset is as good as we think. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "And Bryan, on the international PV up-tick in this quarter, for reasons that are not -- that aren\u2019t clear other than the tension that we had around China and Japan, and mostly in Asia Pacific around that impacted the Chinese, the Japanese, Korean cross-border travel as tensions over Island ownership spiked. And everything from the Senkakus to the Diaoyus to the Spratleys, there seemed to be a more broad-based malaise in that quarter. And the recovery, if I can call it that or the rebound was very broad-based. It's still down. And that \u2013 in that [pocket] of Asia where the \u2013 where that tension existed last quarter, but there\u2019s been more of a broad-based uptick. So, it's not win specific, it's more a broad-based uptick. And remember for us, that\u2019s the world excluding Europe.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Visa Inc\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.", "With that, and in contrast to what\u2019s been a historical pattern, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, Visa\u2019s 15% net revenue growth in fiscal second quarter was once again broad based as we continue to see strong credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of World, which is now supported by a return to positive growth in our aggregate U.S. debit business.", "Second, client incentives for the quarter. As a percentage of gross revenue, we\u2019re 16.1%. Similar to last quarter, this was a result of lower than expected deal activity. However, for the balance of fiscal 2013, we expect lower incentive levels than originally projected. The new 10-year deal structure with Chase has the effect of simultaneously reducing both gross fees and revenue incentives with one largely offsetting the other. This contractual change which is now signed and in effect in combination with the timing and revenue mix have caused us to lower our full year client incentive outlook from 18% to 18.5% down to 16% to 17% for fiscal 2013.", "Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume growth turned positive in the fiscal second quarter of 2013 versus a negative 3% in the fiscal first quarter. Of note, the month of March saw the onset of a significant positive inflection point as we lapped last year's adoption of the Dodd-Frank routing rules for U.S. debit. While interlink payment volume growth was in negative mid-teen territory, Visa debit payment volumes saw a 12% rate of growth.", "Fourth, as a result of a more certain revenue outlook and earlier than planned share repurchases, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 EPS guidance from high teens to around 20%. Lastly, as we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and through this end during the quarter, we spent $1.8 billion to repurchase 12 million shares at an average price of $157. This means through the first two fiscal quarters, we have spent 3.1 billion to repurchase 20 million shares at an average price of $152. As we begin the fiscal third quarter, our remaining open to buy stands at $1 billion.", "Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal second quarter followed by our results through April 28th. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013.", "The payment volume growth rates which follow are unadjusted for the leap year in 2012. Normalizing the month of February would add about 1 percentage point of growth to the second quarter's results. Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 9%, on par with the December quarter's 9%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions, including the U.S.", "We saw some incremental benefit from the early lapping effects associated with U.S. debit regulations. More recently in the U.S. through April 28, payment volume growth was 12% compared with 4% in the March ending quarter. U.S. credit growth held at Q2 levels while debit experienced improved growth rates.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter, which compares to 11% rate in the December quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and the rest of world 11%. Through April 28, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10% with the U.S. growth rate of 7% and the rest of world at 12%.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.9 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 6% increase over the prior-year period. U.S. saw a 3% increase in transactions while the rest of world delivered 21% growth. Through April 28, processed transaction growth was a positive 15%, driven in part by the lapping of the U.S. debit routing regulations. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year.", "Turning to the income statement; net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues, and as mentioned earlier lower than anticipated client incentives. Hedging resulted in no meaningful foreign exchange impact on that revenue in the quarter.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.4 billion up 10% over the prior-year period. Revenue growth was in line with constant dollar payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion up 25% over the prior-year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions inside and outside the U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market.", "International transaction revenue was up 13% to $831 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of growth to revenue for the quarter came in at 16.1% lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of deals in the quarter. Looking forward the change in pricing structure related to the Chase contract in combination with deal timing and revenue mix now suggest full-year client incentives in the 16% to 17% range.", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion up 13% from the prior-year. This was primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategies. The rate of operating expense growth should slow in the second half. Marketing expenses were up 15% primarily due to a low-spend level in the prior-year largely related to the timing of the London Summer Olympics. Spend will step up in the fiscal third and fourth quarters as we increase marketing to support a number of campaigns including the FIFA Confederations Cup in South America.", "Operating margin for the quarter was 63%, well slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60% this margin level is consistent with how we plan for the year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 31.6% and it's fully consistent with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%. Net income at $1.3 billion was up 17% over prior-year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.92 for the quarter up 20% over prior-year adjusted results due in part to a strong commitment to return excess cash in the form of share repurchase. As noted earlier our full-year adjusted EPS guidance is now around 20%.", "Finally capital expenditures were $111 million in the quarter and continued to be in line with our full-year expectations. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal second quarter totaled $660 million. Other than the changes to our client incentives and diluted earnings per share growth all other outstanding guidance remains the same.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Thanks, Byron and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re happy with our continued strong performance and as Byron walked us through it was a strong growth across the world. Economic uncertainty does remain but our business model continues to prove itself through own environments and growth rates as Byron had mentioned have continued through April which makes us feel quite good.", "We continue to build on some exciting partnerships around the world both traditional and involving emerging technologies. Just a few important examples of these I want to mention. We executed a multi-year co-brand renewal with South West Airlines one of our largest co-brands in the United States. We have talked about V.me before. We now have 82 U.S. issuers who have agreed to participate. We have more than 180 merchants signed, 20 of which are top 100 internet retailers and there are 37 merchants live today and more coming online as we talk.", "During the quarter we also announced a broad based partnership agreement with Samsung covering Visa\u2019s payment capabilities on Samsung devices. Samsung phones will be preloaded with Visa payWave for contactless payments and the Visa Mobile Provisioning Service to securely download payment account information to NFC-enabled Samsung devices. These are just a couple of examples of some of the most important things that we executed in the quarter.", "I want to turn and talk for a second about Europe. There's been a lot of discussion about a couple of items, so we thought we would walk through each of these one by one. First of all, let's just talk about our relationship with Visa Europe and the put. I guess I would say is we've read when you've read. We do not know what they'll do. And just as a reminder, they have a put, so it's their decision. We do not have a call.", "The way we think about it, they have three options relative to our relationship. They can keep our relationship as is, they can exercise the put or they can propose an alternative which is different from the put. If they choose to exercise the put, there's a clearly defined process for that. If they were to propose something other than the put, we would consider it and if still inclined, we would negotiate it in normal course. But the process of the put would not apply. It was clear when I got here that we're always prepared if they choose to exercise the put to go through the process and have our points of view on that.", "Having said all that, we believe that we compete effectively now but there is certainly a clear benefit over the long term to be one company, and I've talked about that before. I think it's true both for Visa Inc. as well as for Europe, but they need to come to that conclusion themselves. But I think most importantly in all of this is we're prepared to compete regardless of the structure, regardless of which avenue they go down. And if the situation changes, we'll obviously report back, but as of now what you read are the facts I believe.", "The second issue is the EC enquiry. They are investigating intra-European credit interchange rates and inter-regional credit interchange rates, which is where a non-European cardholder uses their card within Europe. They're also investigating certain MasterCard rates as well. If the EC ultimately challenges Visa and MasterCard's conduct, we expect that would seek to prohibit Visa and MasterCard from setting default inter-regional interchange rates at their current levels.", "In addition, the EC is investigating Honor All Cards, no surcharge rules, as well as the practice of blending merchant fees. We're in discussions with the EC and have nothing to report yet. There is a disagreement to the extent Visa Europe has an obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. on this issue. We're confident in our position that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and we're engaged in conversations with them to resolve the matter.", "Let me move and just quickly cover two regulatory and litigation items that you're all aware of. The first one is the MDL. The deadline for the opt outs is May 28 and we're confident that the judge will approve the settlement. On the Department of Justice, there is no update. We remain comfortable. Our actions are appropriate.", "Let me move on now and just talking back to last quarter's earnings call. On that call, I talked about our need to become more flexible and the need to work more closely with merchants, and I'm going to talk a little bit more about this. Just a reminder, as we think about our opportunity we believe the number one opportunity for us is to move transactions from cash onto our electronic platform.", "And we're confident that RSFs are of the quality and the scope that we believe we would get our fair share of transactions in the process. This really is about moving transactions away from cash. Our focus is on helping issuers remain competitive at the point-of-sale. The ecosystem is evolving and we need to evolve as well to make sure we remain competitive at that point. So to that end, we're evolving our rules.", "We also aggressively continue to invest in new capabilities that we think will benefit everyone in the payments value chain. And a court example of this was effective February 1st we modified one of our rules to enable issuers and merchants to differentiate at the point-of-sale. This could take form in a whole series of things, but it could include things such as discount, offers or incentive. We like this change because it creates an environment where all four parties, consumers, issuers, acquirers and merchants now have the ability to work together to create their most \u2013 the most robust experience for all and all four parties will now be able to work together to use on network to help us grow Visa payment volume and the role we hadn\u2019t placed did not allow that to happen.", "Lot of talk about the Chase contract and the Chase contract in reality is just one example of giving our issuers and acquirers an opportunity to create an environment to actually do what we just talked about, which is delivering more value to merchants and consumers. So we included a slide, but I thought I would walk through exactly just what it is. First of all, it's a 10-year renewable partnership. As part of this, we will create a distinct custom platform within VisaNet for the processing of their transactions, which I believe they are referring to is Chase Merchant Services or CMS.", "This image of Visa\u2019s authorization clearing and settlement system will license to them exclusively for their use. The Chase transactions will still originate from the Visa branded card, but will be processed in one or two ways. The first way, it will be \u2013 would be just as happens today. The second if the card is used to the merchant with whom Chase has a direct agreement for CMS, the transactions will be processed over the platform provided for them by us.", "Visa branding on the cards and at the point of sale remains the same. The CMS platform is customizable, but the transactions will continue to meet our safety, security and sound as standards and we can offer similar functionality to any other Visa client. Visa retains ownership and control of this technology and intellectual property which is obviously critical for us.", "Chase like any other issuer today can negotiate interchange directly with merchants, whether the transaction is processed from CMS or VisaNet. Not sure that this is well understood that it\u2019s \u2013 that issuers have the ability to do this today, but they do in fact have the ability to do it and Chase any of the merchants, we will continue to have the ability. The pricing levels and mechanics for our dealer Chase are consistent with what would be available; the clients have Chase their size and scope for making a 10-year commitment. And obviously important for us, we Visa will gain additional consumer credit and debit volume.", "Looking ahead, we will continue to develop new capabilities, enhancing our business practices because we want to help issuers, acquirers, and merchants of all sizes work more closely together to take full advantage of the opportunities emerging across the industries and to that end we are in active discussions with other partners on ways to use our network to help them differentiate. If clients are interested, we\u2019re willing to pursue customized arrangements that make sense to their own business needs. But we will adhere to certain core Visa principals which is the manner in which we had approached the Chase arrangement.", "Just a few of these would be, number one, is it would have to support the Visa brand. We\u2019d have to support our safety, soundness, and security standards that we maintain. We would have to make control \u2013 maintain control over the IP, we would have to continue to enable clients of all sizes to compete in the marketplace. And probably most importantly whatever we do, we\u2019d have to add value to the Visa network.", "The bottom line is we believe that what \u2013 that our approach here relative to Chase and our approach with all issuers, acquirers, merchants of all sizes, our steps that are good for the electronification of payments, good for all of our partners and therefore good for us.", "There is a lot more we can talk about, but we do have plans for you all, the complete strategic update at our Investor Day, scheduled for June 6. At that meeting we intend to cover plans for what we are doing both in the developed and the emerging economies and we intend to focus a lot on e-Commerce, mobile solutions, and what we're doing in the technology space in general. So, we will leave a bunch of the discussions for that and still we have plenty of time.", "And with that, I think we will stop and will open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks. I think the \u2013 revenue performance obviously very strong. I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see that progressing. Obviously, it sounds like the incentives that you were talking about was lower incentives in the current period, and so can we take away from that that you're actually seeing kind of better combination, if you will, of kind of volume coming out of debit and some of the pricing actions that you've taken?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So let me respond to that. First, just to be clear on the incentive piece, a large contributor to the reduction in the incentive guidance going forward and to a certain extent this quarter, when we signed the Chase agreement it restructured how we price so that as I said in my opening remarks, gross fees are coming down along with incentives and it's largely an offset. So while incentives for the balance of the year are expected to come in, in that 16% to 17% range, that in and of itself is not a significant contributor to the revenue performance for the balance of the year because we haven't changed our overall revenue guidance. So we are well positioned within the low double-digit range. And what we're seeing underlying that is strong, sustained performance globally. And we're two quarters now under our belt. And because of our quarter lag, remember that we actually have visibility to three quarters of service revenue. We have a much higher degree of certainty of how the year will flow out. And given the strength we're seeing outside the U.S. had good sustained recovery in our U.S. debit business as you've pointed out, and particularly as we enter into the April, May, June quarter, this will anniversary the Dodd-Frank routing rules. Notice I said Dodd-Frank not Durbin. And so while the debit business in the U.S. has sustained a meaningful loss particularly in the interlink, we're pleased with the way our mitigation strategies have unfolded and the way the business has been recovering over the past several quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Good evening. Quickly, I was wondering if you could address any material pricing differences between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe that would have to be overcome should the put be exercised. And although I know it doesn't materially impact your top line, I was wondering if you could just clarify what's going on with the cash volumes in Latin America that seem to be off dramatically? Thanks.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "The pricing approach that Visa Europe pursues is one that's still very much based on a bank-owned membership arrangement. And so it's different than what we have here in the United States for Visa and globally outside of Europe. Having said that, Visa Europe is still not priced to be competitive with other competitors like MasterCard in that arena, and so we've not done a detailed analysis of what the comparisons are, but there is a presumption that to be competitive you have to price competitively. And we consider Visa Europe very competitive in that part of the world. So don't really have a comment on that. And with regards to the cash volumes in Latin America, don't have a comment on that either. And so we'll \u2013 that's when we'll have to take a look into and we'd be happy to get back to you through IR.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me just add to Byron's response on the Visa Europe question. As I said in the remarks, there's a very defined process that we would go through with Visa Europe where we look at the sustainable earnings power of the company. And I would presume a big part of that discussion would be what the sustainable revenue contribution would be as the model evolved and there is plenty of time throughout that process to have that discussion with them, if we get to that point.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Bill Carache of Nomura. Your line is open.", "Bill Carache - Nomura", "Thanks. Good evening. So between about $1.8 billion of buybacks and over $200 million in dividend, it looks like your payout ratio was about 160% this quarter there about. As we look ahead, with final approval of the merchant litigation, which we expect, influence your mindset or attitude regarding capital return, perhaps just making you feel like you have a bit more flexibility there?", "Charles W. Scharf", "The answer is no. We have \u2013 we began life as a public company committed to return excess cash to shareholders. We have done that aggressively over five plus years. Every time that was an opportunity to in effect put money into the escrow on behalf of the U.S. bank shareholders. And do that in a way that it had the effect of share repurchase, we did that. Have that money not going into the escrow. I\u2019m fairly confident in saying that we\u2019d have ended up buying back in the open market, those shares.", "And just the final point, you mentioned the buyback and the dividends for the period. If we think about our commitment in the following way. I think there is underscores not our commitment to return. We have guided $6 billion of free cash flow for the year. Roughly one billion of that six will be generated in offshore in ways that we\u2019d not bring back to the U.S. and subjected to taxes at least at this \u2013 any time in the near future. That leaves $5 billion. We have authorization to repurchase a little over $4 billion for the year of which we have basically bought back through the first six months $3 billion of the $4 billion and if you take four full quarters of dividend payments, you\u2019re approaching a $1 billion. So if have the share repurchases and set forward to the dividends of one, you get $5 billion of the $6 billion of free cash flow, in effect return to shareholders in the $1 billion that isn\u2019t is offshore.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss this merchant litigation that\u2019s been threatened in Europe, that you guys disclosed in the 10-Q, it seems like you feel like you\u2019re being in \u2013 you should be indemnified there as well. But I was wondering if can just flush that out a little bit. I guess, was that the part of the reason that would drive the banks to exercise the point. And then second, I just want to make sure I understood Byron\u2019s point about the Chase. With the gross revenue yield then come down next quarter, given the structuring of the deal, because if you look at kind of the year-over-year change, those were up in the second quarter? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "You want to answer the second one first Bryon?", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Yeah, let me do the second one first. Everything else being equal, yes the gross revenue yields would come down isolated to that one factoring Chase, because you still have the transactions, but the way that they are being charged gross equals net, no incentives. And so incentives would go down, gross yield would go down.", "Charles W. Scharf", "And on the first point, let me take a shot at that for a second. So, there \u2013 the EC is investing \u2013 is investigating several different things. One of which is INTRA, European Credit Interchange, so this is where there is a card issued within Europe and its used inside of Europe. That affects Visa Europe, it does not affect us. For say, and they are also investigating inter \u2013 interchange, which is when it is a card issued outside of Europe and its used inside of Europe.", "We obviously don\u2019t know since we\u2019re in discussions with them weird winds up, we have nothing to report on exactly the specifics of what they\u2019re thinking in relative to how it impacts their view of the put. I think honestly that is a \u2013 that\u2019s a question for them, whether its for Visa Europe or for the banks themselves. I would say \u2013 what we think about is what it does to our thinking about Visa Europe. And in the different scenarios that I spoke about, to the extent that we have to go through a valuation process to understand what the sustainable earnings of Visa Europe would be, that whatever the conclusion of this inquiry would be, would obviously help us \u2013 point us towards what the affect of this could certainly be. And if it's something outside of the put, we would obviously have to take into account as well. But when it's concluded, we'll know the specifics and we'll be in a position to understand the impacts", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. The clarification just in terms of other future deals, like the Chase deal, are you guys kind of waiting for inbound interest in terms of other issuers approaching you? Are you actually proactively marketing just two other biggest issuers? And then, just as my question also on the topic of the 10-Q, saw some language in there around CFPB taking a look at currency conversion fees on cross-border transactions, just any comments you may have on that? Thanks.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Okay. So on the first question; we're not the type of organization that waits for our clients to call us. I mean in all seriousness, we talk with our clients literally day-in and day-out. So when this was announced, there were certainly extensive conversations that have gone on and continue to go on with clients of all sizes. And even before the announcement, the conversations that we've had were very consistent with the messaging that I laid out on the last call, which is that we want to be more flexible, we want to evolve our rules and we want to focus much more on working with merchants. So we are actively involved in talking to institutions of all sizes. I would describe them as very, very different types of conversations with people having different capabilities and different desires. And when I went through my introductory remarks, I kind of laid out what some of the principles are for us to follow, but if we can do things with them that would help them grow their business and help us grow payment volume, that's something we're very excited to do.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me take the question on the CFPB. As you might imagine we have quite a bit of experience globally working with regulators and it's not uncommon for them to reach out in a very informational way to try and understand how certain practices unfold within our ecosystem, and that is very much the nature of this dialogue with the CFPB. They have reached out and asked us if we would help them \u2013 help educate them on how the currency trading ecosystem works as it relates to credit and debit cards. And so myself along with a number of my colleagues have met with them personally. It was a very straightforward educational type discussion focused on the mechanics of how currency conversion works. I would describe the working relationship as very cordial, very sound. I would say at the same time that our engagement is ongoing and we will of course keep you all informed as this dialogue unfolds.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Charlie, since it's spring, it's the season for this. I was wondering how you would characterize the general tone for new fees at this point. Should we expect more or less revenue growth coming from new fees this year than in prior years?", "Charles W. Scharf", "I didn't realize that spring was the period of time for new fees. I think I'll leave it at the revenue guidance overall that Byron gave, I think that's \u2013 for us to talk about in another level of detail of what we're forecasting for revenues would go beyond what is our practice and that's something that we wouldn't want to get into.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "I would just add to that. When we gave the original guidance that Charlie referred to at the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that it was that we would deliver our revenue the old fashion way through volume increases and that there would not be a material reliance on any sort of price -- pricing overall within the business plan for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Hey, great. So a two part question on the Chase VisaNet deal; can you just give us a sense of the reaction you\u2019re getting from other banks in the wake of that deal and also maybe the acquirer community how they\u2019re reacting. And if you see any major constraints on the ability of other particularly large banks to pursue a similar deal Chase VisaNet type deal? And then Byron maybe on the numbers, can you give us a sense on whether you expect to be revenue positive on the Chase deal over the next year after the -- clearly there\u2019s some discounting that\u2019s going on, on that contract. Will the volume gains from MasterCard at Chase offset the impact of the pricing discounts? Thanks.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Let me start with the -- so why don\u2019t we start with the numbers. So the answer to the first part of the question was, do we expect to be volume accretive with the signing of this contract going into the \u2013 excuse me, revenue accretive going into the next year and the absolute \u2013 the question is absolutely yes, that when we factor in all the elements of the deal including those who reference we expect to have positive revenue growth with the Chase relationship in the coming year. And relative to the reaction of \u2013 from banks and acquirers to Chase, I mean I would honestly \u2013 I guess, I would say it was mixed initially and quite candidly it was probably confusing because there were not a lot of facts because there were terms disclosed at the point of a letter of intent not a final contract which is what we have signed now. So we have been able to have much more in depth conversations about what it is, similar to what we\u2019ve talked about here. And I think the conversation is very much at move to what is it, it's confusing, what does it mean and this is both on the bank side and the acquirer side to really what Visa do to help them customize and differentiate with their experience. So we\u2019re having that discussion, again from small institutions to much bigger institutions and acquirers alike and as I said, I think the overwriting concept here is; the world is changing around us. And there are lots of people that we compete with and people who want to compete with us that have strategies around working with merchants at point of sale and if we don\u2019t figure out how to evolve our model to encourage issuers and acquirers to do that then we\u2019ll be leaving great opportunity on the table and so we do have to be flexible on how we do it as long as we don\u2019t think that it violates any of the principles that I spoke about before and we feel very good that what we\u2019re doing actually does that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, good results. I\u2019ll ask a couple of the modeling nerd questions. Data processing fee that yield or revenue per trend, I jumped that quite a bit. The biggest we\u2019ve seen in a long time. What's driving that and I guess, going forward that will be impacted to some degree by the Chase deal and secondly the international transaction fee line looks like the revenue growth grew at a premium to cross-border volume for the first time over a couple of quarters, what's driving that as well? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "So let me respond. So, on the data processing yield, as you all remember about a year ago as part of our Dodd-Frank debit mitigating strategy we restructured our pricing. We introduced a lower variable transaction fee. We introduced for the first time a fixed acquirer network fee. When we first introduced those in the way that we bill and record revenue we had to do that to a certain degree with some estimates, and since it was a new pricing structure. And as we conclude the March quarter, we pretty much got a year of this under our belt. And so we're now in a position where we can start to true up some of these estimates. And what you saw in the data processing yield line was some true-up there and a few credits. Going forward, I would say that the data processing yield is more likely to approximate what you saw in Q1 as opposed to Q2, still very solid but I think that's from a nerdy modeling standpoint; I think that's probably the guidance we were looking for. With regards to international, as we have talked about this particular line on several occasions before, there is always some degree of variability between volume and reported revenue. Part of it is revenue mix. Part of it is the amount of volatility we see in the currency markets. And in periods where there is a higher degree of volatility, often associated with saber rattling or conflicting claims on islands in the China Sea, anything \u2013 issues around Cypress, anything that royals the currency markets and creates more volatility, creates a bit more \u2013 has an impact on the revenue that we report. And so that was the case with international this past quarter. We had a step-up in currency volatility relative to what we've seen historically. And then we also had little bit of a tailwind with regards to the specific currency and their waiting during the quarter, some currencies just naturally yield more of a return across our fee base than others. So that's the reason.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.", "Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Thank you. Just two quick ones. What would be the strategy on funding the put if it were to be executed? And then secondly, I'd like a little update on CyberSource. It's been growing 25% for the last couple of years, it doesn't seem to be slowing and I just wondered if the revenue was growing in line with that? And what the operating profit margin is on that CyberSource business and any update on strategy would be helpful?", "Charles W. Scharf", "So let me take that. So in the event that we needed to consider funding for Visa Europe, let me just give you the following perspective. We currently \u2013 at the end of this quarter, we have roughly 2.2 billion of cash that is in offshore accounts not immediately required for working capital. That 2.2 would be available for use in a Visa Europe put situation. Once the put \u2013 if and when the put is exercised, we have 285 days to negotiate out and fund the transaction. During that period, we would generate in the normal course of business at least 3 billion of free cash flow. So before we ever get to debt, if any were to be required, recognizing we have no debt we've got 5 billion of cash readily available to deploy. And that's not to say that we would use all that cash because this might \u2013 again, if the put were to be exercised, this might be a good opportunity to actually put some debt on the balance sheet and lower our weighted average cost of capital. The second question was CyberSource. CyberSource was acquired, as you might remember, because it moved us closer to the merchant checkout page with regards to Internet transactions. The fastest growing channel we have today is Ecom and CyberSource gives us an additional value add in the transaction and a way of directly connecting to the acquirer to our network in a way that is very synergistic with the rest of our business. When we acquired CyberSource, it was primarily a U.S. business. The opportunity for us was outside the United States. And so we have invested aggressively inside resource to accelerate the expansion of that business outside the United States and as a result have been successful in sustaining its transaction growth rate at 20 plus percent ever since we acquired the business. And I can tell you that, that transaction growth rate is slightly above the pro forma projections that we presented to our board when we justified the purchase price. So we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the role CyberSource is now playing in the Visa Inc global strategy as we zero in on capitalizing on the internet growth opportunity which is absolutely global in its scope.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "And I\u2019ll just add, as we -- all of our work that we\u2019ve got going on with merchants as I talked about, CyberSource and its capabilities are a tremendous advantage for us in those conversations.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Julio Contreras of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Julio Contreras - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys not to beat a dead horse, but I guess I\u2019ll keep jumping on this Chase Merchant Services contract. Thinking through the reaction I guess, mostly as it relates to, kind of the independent or standalone merchant acquirers versus the bank owned merchant acquirers, how exactly would you distinguish the benefits to each one of these guys, especially if they don\u2019t actually issue their own cards?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Well, again I think, I guess the way we think about it is; what we\u2019re willing -- the importance of what we did with Chase is not specifically about the Chase structure. It's about what the intent we\u2019re trying to get at, which is to put issuers and acquirers together to work directly with merchants. So, to the extent that a bank owns an acquirer it obviously allows you to have that conversation under one roof, to the extent you have issuers who don\u2019t control their own acquirers hopefully now they\u2019re thinking about and that are in fact having conversations with acquirers about the types of things that they could do if they worked more closely together. The reality is, I think if you go around and talk to most issuers they would probably say that there wasn\u2019t a lot of conversation that went on between the issuing and acquiring side, and partially because of our rules that stood in the way of them working together to do something positive for the merchant. And so now that we\u2019ve given them the ability to do that, I don\u2019t -- it shouldn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t have to own your own acquirer in order to take advantage of the changes that we\u2019ve made. And I think quite frankly we\u2019ll see how it evolves. I think, going back to Rod\u2019s question earlier I mean, there are -- there\u2019s some people that look at this and say, okay, got it, understand it, but it don\u2019t believe it. I think it's too hard, I don\u2019t think it's going to be successful, I don\u2019t intend to change anything, and we\u2019ll wait and see. And if we get to a point of, hey there\u2019s something there then we\u2019ve got capabilities and we\u2019ll go forward with that. There are others that are more interested in thinking through how to take advantage of some of the things that we\u2019re willing to do. And I think honestly this will evolve over the next, it will take -- I am going to say a couple of years. It's not the type of thing that will be -- won't be very, very short. If they involved not just conversations between issuers and acquirers but you have to have conversations with merchants. They have to believe that there\u2019s a real value proposition there. They have got to do some thing different potentially in their stores with their customers, and that\u2019s not always the most obviously and easy conversation but again we think it's the right conversation to have, but it's a thesis that has to be proved.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Thanks. Listen just to firstly clarify on the Chase deal timing again, and then a quick question on the stored wallet fee. So, first on Chase, did the deal economics actually show up at all on the quarter that was just reported, in terms of the incentives and the -- because you came in at 16% as a percentage of gross revenue, so it seems a little lower than the 18% plus. And then just a question on the stored wallet fee that MasterCard has announced, it seems like these are still not committed to doing that as far as at least we have seen. Can you just give us some idea and thought around that fee and really your interaction with for instance, PayPal and some of the ecommerce players that, that could affect?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Okay, let me take the first one. So, just to clarify the question, did \u2013 because the Chase deal was signed in April actually, it did not have any impact to the quarter just reported. So this is \u2013 it has a retroactive effect a little bit earlier, but that is all contemplated in the guidance that we gave for the balance of the year.", "Charles W. Scharf", "And on the staged wallet question, so first of all just on the actual staged wallet fee that MasterCard implemented, that's not something that we're currently contemplating but we're actively thinking through what has changed in the ecosystem and how we have to react to that. Our relationship with PayPal and people like them has evolved. It's complicated. They specifically are a very important customer of ours, but they have their own ambitions and we're mindful, I think, first and foremost of the impact that they have both positively and negatively potentially on our issuers because that ultimately will be what determines our success. And I think we are actively thinking about the right way to restructure the ecosystem in a way that works for everyone. And we've got nothing to announce now, but we will at some point.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Togut of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you. What is Visa's strategy to gain market share in the corporate card market versus MasterCard?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Byron, do you want to talk about\u2026", "Byron H. Pollitt", "So, in the commercial side this is \u2013 a lot of success in this marketplace is dependent on the sophistication of the platforms that you bring to bear to service corporate clients. It's a very information reporting intensive business. And we have made significant investments over the last several years in a platform we refer to as IntelliLink. We believe what we have today is a state-of-the-art and one that has been compared to where we were five years ago has been a game changer for us in terms of being much more successful in capturing commercial business, and it's largely driven by the investments in the sophistication of reporting multi-currency, multi-country and that's really the lead card we play.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research", "Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just turning to U.S. credit, clearly you've had a great run recently; you've been posting above market growth. But what's important for us is to get a sense of how much longer this can continue. So on the vein, is it possible just roughly to parse your growth into maybe sources of three buckets like just having faster growing clients because of client-specific reasons, clients that are growing Visa volume faster because of the things you're doing with them. And then finally just share gains overall. And can you roughly bucket that for us? And then maybe sum it up with some texture of how much pent-up above market growth do you have in the backlog and the pipeline here to give us confidence that this can continue for several more quarters or even beyond that?", "Charles W. Scharf", "I guess I'll just start Byron and you can chime in. I mean, it's obviously \u2013 it's very hard right now to put things into the buckets numerically the way you spoke about. But I think when you look at our issuing base, we've certainly benefited from the partnerships that we have with the faster growing issuers out there. And you can say that that's luck on our part historically or it's that Visa targeted the right population of customers. And I think it stands for itself. Things don't happen by chance and we do have a very fast growing set of customers that we certainly benefit from. And the same thing is true relative to the co-brands that we have. Co-brands can put us just like anything else not all co-brands are equal, and we think we\u2019ve got the premier client base out there and we\u2019ve been clearly very big beneficiaries of that and would expect that to continue.", "Charles W. Scharf", "I will just add one other component to this, in addition to the quality and the growth delivered by the issuer that\u2019s also impacted by the quality of the card holder portfolio as measured by affluent income levels and we\u2019re very well positioned in the affluent portfolios and if you think about it, what has driven the credit card, payment volume, growth over the \u2013 certainly over the past two years has been predominantly affluent. And so being well positioned as the economy recovers this is an area where we\u2019re well positioned to sustain this kind of growth. It should be less volatile in that sense and so we certainly feel it has strong leg. Relative to the delta, that\u2019s a much harder one to frame.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, hi guys. Just a couple of questions, I guess first on the EC enquiry, does that have any potential impact on Visa\u2019s fees or are we talking about Visa Europe fees and then on the Chase of Visa deal, I guess two questions one, are we talking about a material amount of volume that you guys expect the consumer credit and that I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if that\u2019s new cards just for new business or will that be some of the existing business. And then finally on the, I\u2019ve heard you say Charlie before that the Chase could have done this on-us transactions before so, then the question comes out, then why they\u2019re using Visa at all, and is Visa getting any money at all for allowing on-us transactions. Thanks so much.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Well, let\u2019s start there. What we said they could do historically was enter into pricing arrangements, directly with merchants relative to interchange. And again anyone can do that today, and that\u2019s not specific to on-us transactions. So, I am not sure then the rest of the question flow so if we didn\u2019t answer it, maybe come back and ask us the question again. But they and everyone else have the ability to go and negotiate interchange and they\u2019ve got the ability to do that in this agreement in a different format and different structure. On the size of the Chase commitment, again I think the best way to characterize that is what Byron said, which net-net all in all we think that we\u2019re still in a position to grow revenues and how we get there and what not is, not something that I think is appropriate for us to talk about. And back on the first piece, on the EC inquiry it is on interchange, and so that would be the direct impact of what it is they\u2019re looking at today.", "Jack Carsky", "At this point we have time for one more question operator.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Moshe.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Moshe, are you there?", "Operator", "He disconnected. We can go on to a next question if you wish?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Okay, someone hit the lottery.", "Operator", "John Williams of UBS. Your line is open.", "John Williams - UBS", "Hey, you snuck me in. Thank you, guys. Thanks for taking my question.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Thank Moshe.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Thank Moshe.", "John Williams - UBS", "I will. So I had a follow-up, I hate to beat the dead horse on Chase Merchant Services and forgive the basic nature of my question, but I think it's reasonable to say J.P. Morgan is not paying you guys very much in the way of assessment fees and so as you consider doing this deal, what was lacking in the relationship that made something of this magnitude necessary, I mean obviously you\u2019re locking up a large customer for a while but how does Visa actually benefit in an incremental way because it sounds like on one hand you might get more transactions but on the other hand the on-us transactions will stay on us. So if you could give a little more color on how you guys specifically benefit in incremental way that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah, I mean I\u2019ll give your point of view but again why, some of those questions I think are important for them. So specifically from our point of view, we don't believe that this structure was necessary to accomplish what the end goal is. The structure is something that we worked on together because it's something that was important to them, but that's \u2013 which is why we believe that this structure isn't specific to them that we could go accomplish the same thing by working with issuers and acquirers separately without this kind of structural transaction that occurred. The benefit in this, if we're successful at this is really related to the rule change that we made, which encourages and allows the issuers and acquirers to go talk to merchants directly and to ask the question what can we do for you or to propose an idea of we can do the following thing for you to help you drive more sales and drive more volume into your stores and in return for that presumably, there will be additional transactions that get directed to the Visa cards. Again, this structure we don't believe is necessary to do that, but it certainly allows that to happen and that's what was important to us.", "Byron H. Pollitt", "Let me just add on the economics, John, that this business has always been built on an economic business model that says the larger the clients, the larger the portfolio, the better pricing you get. And this was one of our largest clients, one of the largest portfolios. We had the opportunity to enter into a 10-year arrangement that has a set of economics that are consistent with how we have been doing multi-year contracts with other clients over the years, including Chase. And given the size of this portfolio and where we expected to be over the next five and 10 years, is there margin compression? Yes. But that margin compression is consistent and the same zip code is what we would normally have expected to have put on the table given the size of the portfolio and the kind of growth that we are expecting this partnership to produce. So from that standpoint, we are very comfortable with the economics of this deal.", "Jack Carsky", "With that, we want to thank you all for joining us once again. And just to reiterate what Charlie said earlier, we are hosting an Investor Day on June 6 here in San Francisco. Formal invites have been sent out, many people have responded.

Let me begin with my usual call outs and observations. First, some color on the third quarter\u2019s 17% net revenue growth. It is important to note that this growth rate benefited from the absence of significant one time client incentives incurred in the prior year. without these one time client incentives, revenue growth for Q3 would have been closer to 14%. That said, payment volume growth was broad based globally for the March quarter and we're seeing double-digit growth rates in the June quarter for both credit and debit on a constant dollar basis. Based on these trends, and with three quarters of the fiscal year now on the books, we are raising full year 2013 revenue guidance from to low double-digits to around 13%. ", "Second, service revenue, though up 7% on year-over-year basis, it was down sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. This was primarily due to the signing of the 10 year Chase deal which was executed in fiscal Q3 but was retroactive to the beginning of Q2. This contract, as discussed on the Q2 earnings call, disproportionately impacted the service revenue line and resulted in offsetting reductions in gross service revenue and related client incentives. Because it was signed in fiscal Q3, the service revenue impacts for both Q2 and Q3 were recorded in the current quarter. This means that Q4 service revenue growth rate should be a more representative indicator of underling growth. ", "Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percentage of gross revenue, were 14.8%. As described previously, two quarters of Chase related incentive reductions were booked in Q3. This impact was constant inflation in our most recent full year guidance and we remain comfortable with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the 16% to 17% range for the full-year 2013. ", "Fourth, now that we have fully left implementation of the Dodd-Frank routing rules, beginning in June, quarterly Interlink payment volume growth has turned positive for the first time in over a year. Going forward as we lapse a period during which Visa\u2019s post Dodd-Frank debit strategies took hold, we would expect healthy but moderating revenue growth rates for U.S. debit. ", "Fifth, given our earnings result year-to-date and our expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance from around 20% to the low 20s. Lastly, as we remain commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders, during the quarter we\u2019ve spent approximately $1 billion to repurchase 6 million shares at an average price of approximately $177.00. this leaves $61 million remaining in our prior authorization. And as we announced earlier, our Board recently authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program which will run through July of 2014. ", "Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the fiscal third quarter, followed by our results through July 21st. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014. ", "Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollars was 18%. Payment volume growth for the June quarter incomes in dollars was 13% above the March quarter's 9%. This was driven by sustained growth in all of our regions including the U.S. which saw some incremental benefit from the lasting effects associated with U.S. debit regulations.", "More recently, in the U.S., through July 21, payment volume growth was 10% compared with 11% in the June ending quarter. Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth of 10% held at Q3 levels while debit, which also grew at 10% experienced a healthy but moderating growth rate as we lap the growing impact of the Visa's U.S. debit strategies.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter which compares to a 10% rate in the March quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and the rest of world 12%. Through July 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with the U.S. growth rate of 9% and the rest of world at 6%.", "The slowing growth in July is most pronounced outside the U.S. and we believe is due in large part to the timing of Ramadan versus last year. Based on historical travel patterns, we estimate the Ramadan impact to be in the 250 to 300 basis points range for the month and if pass this prologue, we should see a bounce back in August.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $15 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 14% increase over the prior year period. The U.S. grew 12% while the rest of world delivered 23% growth. We have now fully lapped the negative impacts associated with U.S. debit regulation. Through July 21, process transaction growth was a positive 14%.", "Lastly, please note that in our operational performance data pack, that was released with today's earnings results, we updated the cash volume in our LAC region to account for several quarters of underreporting by one of our largest issuers in Brazil. As a reminder, these cash volumes have no impact to our revenue.", "Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 17% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, aided by significant non-recurring incentives in the prior-year quarter. Currency hedging resulted in only a modest foreign exchange headwind on net revenue in the quarter. Looking ahead, after factoring in our hedging program, we anticipate continued headwinds in the next fiscal quarter and for fiscal 2014.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 7% over the prior-year period. On a sequential basis, growth was negatively impacted by the Chase agreement which as I previously outlined, resulted in lower service revenue offset by a lower level of incentives paid to Chase.", "Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa, process transactions inside and outside the U.S. and strong cyber storage transaction growth. With the full lapping of the implementation of U.S. Debit Regulation, data processing revenue growth is now relatively on par with process transaction growth.", "International transaction revenue was up 14% to $854 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volume and some modest benefit from higher currency volatility. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of gross revenue for the quarter came in at 14.8%, positively impacted by the Chase deal.", "That said, we anticipate a meaningful step-up in both incentive dollars and the percentage rate in Q4 due to anticipated deal activity both domestic and international which should put us within our 2013 guidance range of 16% to 17%. ", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year adjusted results. This was primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. ", "Marketing expenses were up 4% from the prior year and stepped up from the prior quarter as we increased marketing to support a number of sponsorship campaigns including the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in South America and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. ", "Operating margin for the quarter was 61% and is consistent with our current guidance. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.2% while higher than our full year guidance of 30% to 32%, the year-to-date figure of 31% is tracking to that range. ", "Net income at $1.2 billion was up 16% over the prior year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.88 for the quarter, up 20% over prior year adjusted results. Stronger than anticipated revenue and more aggressive share repurchases were key drivers and as noted earlier our full year adjusted EPS guidance is now low 20s. ", "Capital expenditures $122 million in the quarter and continue to be in line with our full-year expectations. At the end of the June quarter, we had 645 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on a S converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the June quarter totaled 651 million. ", "Finally, in terms of guidance, other than our refinement of full-year 2013 revenue guidance to around 13%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to the low 20s, all other outstanding guidance metrics for the full-year fiscal 2013 and 2014 remain the same. ", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie. ", "Charlie Scharf", "", "Thank you, Byron, and good afternoon everyone. First of all, I just want to reiterate that we feel very good about our performance this quarter. There is very little new news in the underlining revenue trends as Byron has just described, which means that we continue to see broad based growth geographically and also by product. And these are at growth rates consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. ", "People often ask us about what we see in the economy and what I guess we can say is we don\u2019t see meaningful changes to the path of the economic recovery. And while accelerating and certainly a more broad based recovery would be beneficial to us and our clients, we do continue to feel very good about our business and our ability to deliver strong results in the current economic environment. ", "We did host our Investor Day on June 6th and I want to thank all those who attended both physically and listened in. we know it was a lengthy call but hopefully you found it productive. We certainly appreciate all the feedback that we received. Just a couple of quick reminders of some of these important themes that we covered. ", "First of all, you know, we feel great about the strong foundation that this company has been built on. There has been strong historical growth. We have great partners and the company has a tradition of innovation. Second, the macro trends have and will continue to provide tailwinds. The opportunity to move transactions from cash to electronic means is still huge. And we believe we\u2019ll be there for years to come. This is true in both the developed and the developing parts of the world. As you pointed out on Investor Day, we have 22% share TCE in the emerging, I\u2019m sorry, within the developed markets and 9% in the emerging markets. So there is still much room to grow. In addition to us growing along with the growth of TCE across the world.", "We love our core network. It\u2019s served us well and think it provides us tremendous opportunities to leverage and grow our business. Historically, what\u2019s really benefited us has been the global acceptance, the network reliability, safe and security and soundness, and our risk related tools are just a huge value added component to the network. While we continue to build on these historical strengths as we pointed out at the Investor Day, the future for us will be about using the network is a tool, to continue to create more value for issuers, acquires and merchants, and that include us building broader capabilities but also giving them access, it\u2019s our network as a device that connects to them together.", "Third, the company has and continued to make huge investments in the future. We walk through some of the additional spending that\u2019s been done to the tune of an additional $700 million versus prior years, which are for the most part all geared towards growth opportunities.", "And lastly, we talk about our evolving rules and practices, recognizing how the payments world is evolving. We recognize the needs to evolve our company. But we also feel strongly that we need to continue to preserve some core principles, those include the importance of the Visa brand, the safety, security and soundness of the payment system that we continue to protect and control our intellectual property, and that we enable clients of all sizes to compete. So in short, these of things that while we think we can continue to do more and more for all of our clients we think these things could also add value to the Visa network.", "We turn now to little bit of an update on some of the regulatory and litigation items that are both been in the news and we\u2019ve spoken about. First of all in the United States on the MDL case. The deadline for the opt outs was May 28th. As expected I am sure you show lawsuits that were filed against Visa, MasterCard and in some cases the banks from retailers which opted out of the merchant settlement agreement last year.", "The final figures are still being calculated but our estimate of the opt out is that they represent slightly above 25% of our U.S. credit volume. We continue to expect approval from a core sometime in the fall.", "I do want to stress that these are proceedings that have been on going for a long period of time. We remain committed to figuring out how to work with merchants of all sizes to resolve all of our differences amicably and we as you heard from us we are focused on finding new ways to work with them in conjunction with acquires and issuers to support all of the individual constituents growth objectives.", "Secondly, Canada, yesterday Canada\u2019s competition tribunal issue this decision to dismiss the competition bureau\u2019s case and uphold our no surcharge and Honour All Cards rule. We have and we\u2019ll continue to engage with legislators and regulators around the world to promote the understanding of a value of electronic payments to consumers, merchant and governments broadly.", "Let me now turn to Europe, and as a reminder, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe are separate independent operating companies. First of all, let me talk about, in May we alerted you to a European Commission inquiry by the Director of General Competition related to inter-regional credit interchange rates.", "That investigation specifically relates to the interchange applied to transactions between a non-European Union cardholder and the merchant located within the European Union. We continue to assess their claims and we are working in a productive and professional manager with them and hope to reach resolution but there is nothing more to report at this time.", "Separately, the European Commission earlier today released proposed legislation for the payments industry in the European Union which had been expected. The proposed regulation covers a wide range of topics related to the European payments industry including domestic and intra-EU cross-border interchange rates, [co-batching] requirements, process requirements and point-of-sale rules such as Honour All Cards.", "Most recent announcement submission appears to address issues similar to the Commission competition case, but the propose regulation would only applied to transactions when the issuer and an acquirer are located in the European Union.", "We understand that proposed legislation is to beginning of what we expect could be a long process which could take 18 to 24 months. We\u2019ll continue to keep you updated if we learn of any more developments in either these two proceedings.", "Also in Europe, I\u2019m sure we would get a question about the Visa Europe put and there is no update on that.", "Let me move now and just talk for a second about a topic which has lot of you are writing about and has gotten a lot of press and that\u2019s tokenization. And to start with, stating the obvious which is we all know that transactions are increasingly moving to digital card, not present channels due to the growth of web commerce, mobile and digital wallet. ", "As you\u2019ve heard from us in the past we\u2019ve been building our capabilities to deal with transactions like this both technically and through our rules and requirements, V.net and CyberSource are just two examples where we\u2019ve made significant investments to build capabilities in this space. And as we talk about tokenization I do want to just make a point that tokenization is not a new concept to us. Historically, we define the 16-digit account number [method] set and we effectively operate as tokens in the payment system today. ", "The reality is the development of digital commerce and related risks makes the evolution of these existing tokens -- the evolution of these existing tokens to a more secure form very necessary in a way that works both in the physical and the digital worlds. We need to eliminate the flow of sensitive data that might be vulnerable to a breach and new entrance into the payment ecosystem has also brought into question whether the appropriate information will continue to flow between merchant, acquirer, issuer and consumer. And rightly so, the entire payments industry is focused on this. ", "You read earlier this month about efforts that the Clearinghouse has underway with its 22 U.S. banks to do some work on this topic as well. We believe that we play a critical role in helping define the standards for token implementation broadly. We're working closely across the entire payment ecosystem defined very broadly to do this. This is an area where everyone needs to work closely together and it\u2019s paramount that we ensure transparency, security, and integrity so that the integrity of the payment system remains. Successful tokenization initiatives must also be interoperable and standardized and do several very important things. ", "Number one is they need to deliver value to all stakeholders, that includes issuers, consumers, merchants, acquirers, payment gateways, and everyone involved in the digital commerce platform. It\u2019s got to be standards based, technology agnostic such that a tokenization solution builds on the existing open nature of the payments industry while also aligning with emerging payment innovation systems mobile and digital wallets. As I said before, it needs to deliver at least the same level as transparency and reliability that exists today. And equally important it needs to address the needs of everyone globally, not just in the United States. ", "As I said before, we're committed to working on this broadly with all of our partners. it\u2019s something that we are working on and we feel very good about the progress that we're making with our partners on this one. ", "In conclusion, I just want to also talk about the repurchase program that Byron mentioned. It\u2019s the ninth share repurchase program that the Company has authorized, since the IPO, our Board of Directors has authorized over 11 billion in share repurchase programs. And as we\u2019ve talked about I think almost on every call and at the Investor Day since I\u2019ve joined, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders both through repurchase programs like this as well as further dividend increases. So, you know, having been here for nine months, as I commented at Investor Day, I remain more bullish as each day goes on when we look at the opportunities that exist in the industry and the assets and the ideas and the people that we have at Visa.", "So with that, operator, Byron and I are ready to take any questions that are out there. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open. ", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust", "", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Charlie, could you speak broadly about Visa\u2019s U.S. consumer credit share and how you feel you\u2019re positioned to expand share and continue above trend line growth especially as some of your competitors are potentially sharpening the pencil a little bit in the U.S.?", "Charlie Scharf", "", "Sure. Listen, I think, we are blessed with just an outstanding U.S. credit franchise which has been build up through the years through terrific relationships for sure. We look at the partners that we have and look at their performance and certainly our performance has been helped by their strong performance and that\u2019s\u2019 true both on the issuer side, as well as on the co-brand side.", "We\u2019ve also been certainly beneficiaries in the United States credit market as the affluent customer has recovered more quickly than the non-affluent customers and as we look forward more broad-based recovery is something which should be additive to the affluent business that we have today.", "Ultimately, our ability to compete as effectively as we have within the United States revolves around all other things that we've been talking about here that we know we need to continue to build out. Those include what we are doing in the digital space. They include what we are doing in the mobile space, as well as just the continuing to provide the flexibility that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of our core product set.", "So listen and I know from the prior roles that I played, the market has always been a competitive one. There always been networks out there competing for the same business. The pencil have been sharped for a period of time and as we think about what we've got to do going forward, we certainly expect that to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.", "Dan Perlin - RBC", "Thanks. I\u2019m just interested to know, how important, local market processing through, DPS and VPS is you guys, from a long-term growth perspective, it does represent an important enhancement to the yield as you\u2019ve talked about, you highlighted at the Analyst Day and it seems to be kind of coming up, with some pros and cons in various economies as you kind of outlined in your prepared remark. So if you could just speak to that point, I would appreciate it? Thank you.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah. Listen, I mean, as we talked about at Investor Day, processing we think is the second part of the equation that we can provide for our customers. When we process the transaction, when press -- when the transaction goes over our network, we are enable to, that give us the opportunity to do all things that we can do, both from a risk perspective, as well as being able to provide all the analytical information that we can provided back to the issuers in order for them to help grow their business.", "Byron Pollitt", "And I would just add the more of the, the more we integrate into the processing pipeline. The -- we have an opportunity to differentiate our service offering. So in the case of DPS, this creates an opportunity for us to introduce more innovative product services via mobile as an example and to add to phone trackers that expand the activation capability or opportunity for our clients. So where we can provide processing services like DPS which have the single larges debit scale potentially outside of China, I suppose. This is an area where we can excel in delivering client service.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Don Fandetti - Citigroup", "Yeah. Charlie, I\u2019m just curious if there are any updates on the Visa-Chase network deal in terms of timing. I think it was, there was going to be some type of pilot or something by the end of year and then also, I was wondering if you have any sense on the scope of that initiative, will it just be for merchants or transactions that are acquired through payment tackle that be broaden to other merchants indirectly?", "Charlie Scharf", "Okay. So, on the first part of the question, I continue to say this, which is, when it comes to what Chase merchant service is doing, there are series of questions that, you need to ask them about. What we are doing is providing the capabilities that we outlined several quarters ago. We are on schedule to deliver the ability for CMS to be in the marketplace by the fourth quarter. What actually winds up in the marketplace is really driven by them through their discussions with merchants. And again so that, that\u2019s a question for them. ", "And the agreement holds that they need to have a direct relationship with a merchant in order to take advantage of whatever it is they intend to provide through CMS. And so, you know as I\u2019ve said I would, I would expect that sometimes as we get into next year that we would start to see some things in the marketplace and at that point we\u2019ll all be in a position to evaluate what we think the benefit of the mark. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is open. ", "Chris Brendler - Stifel", "", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you would give us an update on V.me specifically on merchant acceptance. It seems from my perspective that I haven\u2019t seen as broader acceptance as I would expect at this point. I think you had some concrete goals for top hundred retailers by the end of this year. Is there an acceleration coming? What\u2019s the issue? Is it difficult to get merchants to add V.me and then along those lines, MCX, is this something that you think potentially as a competitor threat. It seems to be gaining a little bit of momentum? And is V.me a key part of your strategy in combatting merchant mobile wallets? Thanks. ", "Charlie Scharf", "Let me start with V.me. You know I guess when we talk about V.me, you can\u2019t, and it\u2019s hard to separate out how we're doing with this issuers versus how we're doing with merchants because in our discussions with each, we really need to have to grow both sides in order to be successful. Right, it\u2019s the chicken and the egg which is, you know, merchants aren\u2019t going to want to spend the time and the effort and the money to establish V.me on their site unless they think there is a real need for it. And the issuers are going to be careful about marketing it to their clients until there is a meaningful amount of acceptance. ", "Having said that, we now have about 90 U.S. national institutions as partners. they include BofA, PNC, BBBA, ICBA, and others. And some of those have started actively to market these programs. We have signed an additional 72 merchants this past quarter, bringing the total signed number of merchants to 253, many, many of which will go live in the coming weeks and months. So there is a lot more coming here. There is, you know, a fairly significant pipeline of merchants. As we continue to work with acquirers on this to get in the marketplace, we\u2019ll report back. ", "And MCX was the second question. Listen, I think MCX we know what you know about MCX which is, you know you might know more than us. So, you know, our view on MCX is that we will learn as they continue to disclose what it is they're doing and we're focused on doing what we can to build the right kind of tools to work with merchants so that they want to do business with us. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open. ", "", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan", "", "Great. Thanks. That sounds pretty clean. I guess I\u2019d just ask about U.S. debit growth. That did bounce back nicely to 12%. Let's just look at the 10-Q. It says intra-link process transactions were up 25%. I notice it running down pretty sharply so that was a pretty big step up. I\u2019m curious is that sustainable and what\u2019s driving it? Did you clip on some new cars or is that paid, any details that would be great. Thanks. ", "Byron Pollitt", "", "Now, Tien-Tsin, remember we're lapping the implementation of the Dodd-Frank, not suppose to say Durbin anymore, Dodd-Frank rules which took effect April 1st of last year. So it was in that quarter that we experienced the single largest negative growth rate in terms of intra-link volume. In fact, it was a 54% reduction in payment volume growth in the June ending quarter 2012 and then in the coming quarters as our strategies began to gradually take hold, we started to see a less negative growth rate. So one could deduce from that that in terms of actual year-over-year growth rate, it\u2019s considerable that the -- this June ending quarter might be high tide and then as we begin to lap the other quarters, the subsequent quarters that the relative growth will just have a tougher comp to deliver.", "I\u2019d also just like to underscore that there is no way we\u2019re going to recover all that market share that we have considered as a result of the legislative change. So I think that there will be -- we still need a few more quarters in order to get to some sort of normalized state.", "But as I said in my earnings commentary, in the subsequent quarters we still expect healthy growth rates in debit, U.S. debit. But everything else being equal they should moderate a bit as they begin to lap the strategies we put into place which in turn had growing effectiveness as time pass.", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me just add to that. So the follow up is we still think we have from our perspective a business, which can grow at a reasonable rate, understanding that we believe we permanently lost share because of legislation and those two things can coexist.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Just regarding the EU proposal, I wanted to just get some context from you regarding whether or not it\u2019s having any bearings on your discussions with Visa Europe regarding their potential to exercise the put, as well as negotiation of these specific terms, meaning is this then somewhat of a stumbling back -- stumbling block getting clarity on the EU proposal?", "Charlie Scharf", "I think you\u2019ve got to ask, Visa Europe has a put. So, that means, we don\u2019t have a call and we it\u2019s -- and we can\u2019t proactively engage them in a discussion on price or things like that. So what impacts their thinking relative to their desire to put the company, you really have to ask them.", "I mean I think it\u2019s a complicated set of circumstances. There is a lot going on in Europe right now. I think you can make arguments either way, whether it makes -- if you\u2019re sitting in their position, whether it would make you more willing or less willing, but it\u2019s their decision. So they\u2019re the appropriate people to answer the question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two question. First, could you comment on China? There seems to be some movement in terms of issuers being allowed to issue cards in China. Some discussion regarding processing, I\u2019m just wondering if you could discuss there\u2019s been any sign of those discussions or your thought process around timing of when the market might become open to you?", "Secondly, on incentives, like so you\u2019ve got two quarters of benefit from the Chase field in this quarter, I believe this what you said. But looking out to next year, is it reasonable to believe that you could come in as a percentage of gross revenue below the bottom end of this year\u2019s guidance due to the new arrangement or are other clients increasing and therefore that\u2019s a false assumption? Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "Why don\u2019t I start with China and unfortunately there\u2019s still not a lot of new news to talk about with China. The agreement with the WTO requires China to issue regulations by the end of July to open up the domestic market to foreign competition.", "From what we\u2019ve seen, there has been some very small incremental things announced by the Chinese government but they have not been clear as we read the information to lay out a roadmap to open up the domestic marketplace. So we're waiting with everyone else until that happens. We have no better idea than anyone else, how, what form that will take, what time period. The opportunity for us, in what time period that opportunity would evolve. And so, you know, there is not a lot there. ", "Now having said that we're still in the same place with, we feel, from a long term perspective, putting aside whether it\u2019s, one quarter, four quarters or eight quarters away, the opportunity to compete in a domestic marketplace in China with the capabilities that we have, we think could be significant over a long period of time. Unfortunately we still don\u2019t know what the time period is and what the requirements to participate will be. ", "Byron Pollitt", "Over to incentive.", "Charlie Scharf", "You asked an interesting question. There is clearly two forces at work here. One of which is the Chase contract where the pricing has been restructured so that it is more per transaction. There is still incentives related to the contract but not nearly at the magnitude that they were pre contract. At the same time, the vast majority of our issuers are in growth mode with their portfolios. The larger they grow their portfolios, the more incentives we pay. And that has been our business model for decades. ", "And so, as is our practice, we will schedule those out over the next coming, the next two months. We will also take a hard look at what contracts are likely to renew in the coming year, which also raise into that copulation and then give you a report out in October. Let me just signal in the spirit of your question, that it\u2019s best, in our view, it is best to model incentives on a full-year basis recognizing that they can have a lot of variation between quarters and as I said in my earnings remarks, in Q4 we expect an above average level of deal activity as we move to the closing out of our fiscal year. And therefore we expect a higher percent as a -- incentive as a percent of gross revenue. And you should not consider that representative of the go forward trend.

Just a quick question on card not present (NYSE:CNP) given the growth of the eCommerce, how much Visa\u2019s volume today is card not present eCommerce volume and is the revenue yield on those type of transactions the same as for transactions that are card present? Thanks. ", "Charlie Scharf", "", "Good question. That\u2019s not something that we're, that we have decided to speak about publicly at this point. Inevitably though I think that\u2019s something that we will be talking about much more in the future since that is the fastest growing channel that we have and by way of form factor within Form Factor, the fastest growing factor is mobile. And the two of them clearly are linked. So I would say we're short on detail today but more to come in the future. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Your line is open. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen", "", "Okay, thanks. Byron can you talk a bit about credit in the U.S., maybe compare what you\u2019re seeing on the corporate side versus on the consumer side of the business and if there\u2019re any changes during the quarter? ", "Byron Pollitt", "I would say that the, in terms of health, the corporate side is healthy but the factors that are fueling the really strong performance we\u2019ve been experiencing in consumer credit constitute more of a tailwind. When we look across the corporate spend, a lot of that has to do with the degree of recovery in the economies, across the globe. Our view is that the recovery, this is a technical term, is sluggish, which is one step above anemic and given that enthusiastic description, the very fact that we are seeing positive growth in corporate spend on cards in categories like airlines and the T&E components, we view as encouraging.", "Having said that, there is for us in our view a significant opportunity to further penetrate a commercial sector, we have invested significantly in our commercial information platforms that support that part of the business with our commercial clients. And we believe with the investments we\u2019ve made in our IntelliLink platform that we are well positioned to experience meaningful growth in this market segment in years to come.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Arvind Ramani of BNP. Your line is open.", "Arvind Ramani - BNP", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good quarter. I just had a quick question on your -- clearly the affluent has kind of -- has come back. But what are your assumptions for continued growth from the affluent market and also what\u2019s your view on the non-affluent market?", "Charlie Scharf", "So the affluent part of our portfolio really has been the driver of the credit spend that we have been recording over the past year. In the last quarter or two, we are starting to see some participation from the next income cohort down but it is not yet significant and therefore it\u2019s not a material driver in our results today.", "As we look out into the coming year, when I describe the economic -- underlying economic growth as sluggish, if I would relate that to the U.S., creating 200,000 jobs a month, which is kind of the minimum to make any progress against unemployment. We would describe that as non-anemic but as sluggish growth. And -- but it is creating new jobs and those new jobs ultimately translate into spend.", "And so our outlook is that the non-affluent spend will contribute more but not significantly more to the payment volume spend in the coming year. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And when we gave our guidance for \u201814, the limited guidance at this point, that was the assumptions that underpinned the growth rates we expressed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you. International revenue growth was strong in relation to cross border volume growth. Can you talk about the drivers behind that and how much of the lift that you guys get from makeshift toward the tighter yielding geographies?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yeah. So I would say that there is a little bit of mix. There is a lot of volatility. So whenever there is significant volatility in the currency markets that translates into higher international revenue for us. That\u2019s something that can be -- can appear in one quarter and disappear the next relative to whatever an average volatility is.", "We have been seeing with the strengthening of the dollar, the volatility in the Australian dollar, Japanese Yen to a lesser extent to Euro and Sterling, the turbulence in those markets is really -- and the associated volatility is the principal driver of the difference in international revenue versus the actual number of -- versus the growth in payment volume that we experienced.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Okay. Great. Just a two-part question about Europe. So if you were a network impeding in the vast majority of Europe, what do you like and not like about the EC\u2019s regulatory proposals that have recently been released. And do, the second part of the question is, is there any worry that Europe\u2019s regulatory moves might fuel merchants to push for regulation in other countries such as the U.S. and/or emerging countries? ", "", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah, this is our view, if we were Europeans which we are certainly not, I guess when we read it the things that we like about it are I guess first of all there is recognition in the value of interchange. We can argue about what that number is but we\u2019ve heard lots of things through the years about whether interchange should exist or not exist in some parts of the world and recognition that it belongs, it\u2019s a statement in itself. And certainly I put no surcharge into that category as well. And, well then I would say which straddles both sides, the good and the bad, is level playing field. And so our networks that operate both three party and four party models fall into both sides of the camp. So on the one hand, it\u2019s a positive thing to bring some parts of their business into this level playing field. But the fact is there is still a meaningful part of the marketplace that there is just, you can argue an unfair advantage has been given and doesn\u2019t actually solve whatever the underlining regs are supposed to solve. ", "The second thing I would put in the negative category is [co-bashing] and the third thing I would put is this, the splitting of processing from the brand. And the second part of Rob\u2019s question was \u2026", "Byron Pollitt", "", "(Inaudible) is reasonable.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah and so I think it is the whole world, you know the world is a big place, but everyone sees what everyone else does, for sure. Everyone, so people will see what happened here in the U.S. on debit. We\u2019ve seen Australia. They\u2019ve been watching Canada. They\u2019ve been watching Europe. So it\u2019s certainly, you know you have to believe that when one significant part of the world does something that the other part of the world looks at it. You know in this case, you know remember this is proposed legislation. It will take several years for comments and for it to work through its process. So the things that have been decided here as best I can tell are not set in stone. And we\u2019ll see how these things actually evolve in the marketplace. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from Dave Koning from Baird.", "Dave Koning - Baird", "", "Yeah, hey guys. Just looking at the 10-Q, rest of world revenue, not just the international line but actual rest of world revenue is up 24% this quarter. The last four it was up about 10% to 14%. And I think the explanation is some FX volatility probably helped on cross border part of that but it was a pretty big acceleration, maybe you can talk through maybe a couple of other reasons that that also accelerated so much. ", "Byron Pollitt", "There are two reasons that matter. You hit the first one which is the boost in international is reflective. We booked that into the rest of world line. and the second, if you recall, when I mentioned that the 17% revenue growth for the quarter benefited from significant non-recurring incentives that brought the growth rate down by several percentage points if you were to exclude those. All of those significant nonrecurring incentives were outside the United States. So they had the effect of amplifying the growth rate of rest of world. And those are the two main drivers. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Hi, a quick question on EMV. It looks like we're about 18 months from the deadline set in 2015. Are you seeing banks accelerate the issuance of EMV cards ahead of the deadline and any comments on EMV with regards to merchant acceptance would be interesting. Thank you.", "Charlie Scharf", "We certainly hear a fair amount being discussed about it. And we also have, I think, more issuers in the United States issuing Chip Cards due to the importance of making for an easy acceptance experience when people travel outside the United States.", "I don\u2019t have the numbers in terms of the amount of EMV cards that are being issued today. It is bigger than it\u2019s been but it\u2019s not, by any stretch, imagination of the majority of the cards yet. But I did read something recently that suggested that the percentage of issuers that are attending to do it is growing but I don\u2019t think we know any more than that today.", "And on the merchant side, I would say it\u2019s a similar conversation with the exception being to the extent that machines in merchant\u2019s facilities have to be replaced. They appear to be being replaced with machines that will accept the new form of card.", "Jack Carsky", "Brad, at this point, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays", "Thanks guys. Just want to jump in year-to-date we\u2019re clearly seeing a more meaningful margin expansion for this year again versus what we saw in the prior year, really prior to average margins. Average margins to the first three quarters are around 62.5%. So really more than 100 basis points expansion year-over-year. Is there anything unique about the years, quarterly revenues or maybe the operating leverage in the model on the past quarter is that shouldn\u2019t appear as there is something that we can expect this type of margin upside just from thorough operating leverage embedded in the model?", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me respond to that in two ways. First of all, I just want to anchor the group back into the guidance for \u201813 since we are talking margins and you begin with year-to-date. So we held our guidance at around 60% operating margin, which implies -- the math implies that the year-to-date is trending higher than what we would expect for the fourth quarter, which is why we kept it at around 60, so point one.", "Point two, there is fundamental operating leverage in the business as you know. We have been very consistent in that we don't solve for operating margins. We don\u2019t have targets. We don't have internal requirements, what we do solve for our investments that drive shareholder value. It is the nature of our business that many of those investments are expense versus capital. And therefore as we continue to ramp up the investments that support our growth strategies, it is -- they often carry a significant expense component to them and would immediately put down downward pressure on the margins.", "And I think it's safe to say that that philosophy of investing for growth and value both today and tomorrow is the philosophy we intend to follow. And that is -- that means some sacrifices of theoretically higher-margin, we\u2019re fully prepared to do that in the name of shareholder value.", "Charlie Scharf", "And let me just add one more thing to that which is, as it has been pointed out by bunch of you and also on this call, we do operate in a competitive marketplace. And it wouldn\u2019t be right for our long-term shareholder interest to be thinking about how our services should be priced based upon a commitment that we would make to you all to continue to increase the margin levels that we have.", "We have to look at each transaction. How does the market price those transactions, what value do we think we\u2019re providing and have the ability to compete effectively if we think it makes sense. And so that August factored into the guidance that\u2019s given.", "Jack Carsky", "With that, we want to thank you all for joining us here today and if anybody has follow-up questions, please feel free to call investor relations.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you, Brad. Good afternoon. And welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for the 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual call outs and observations. First, some color on the fourth quarter\u2019s net revenue growth. As reported, net revenue grew 9%, three call outs, starting with gross revenue.", "For the quarter, we grew at a healthy 11% rate. Turning to the incentive line, during the quarter, we closed 73 major deals, compared to a quarterly average of 53 for the 2013 fiscal year. This resulted in an incentive rate of 18.6% for Q4, which is well within the neighborhood we signaled on our Q3 earnings call. When combined with the first three fiscal quarters, incentives as a percent of gross revenues came in at 16.5%, right in the middle of our 16% to 17% guidance range for the full year. ", "Finally, the FX headwind, which has accelerated in the second half of the year, reached about 1.5 percentage points of drag on revenue growth in Q4. The full year FX headwind was just under 1% for fiscal 2013. We expect this headwind to continue to grow in fiscal 2014 to about 2 percentage points of drag on reported revenue growth net of our hedges.", "Second callout relates to full-year revenue growth. We began fiscal '13 with revenue guidance of low double-digits and refined the guidance to around 13% on the Q3 call. We end the year with revenue growth up 13% after absorbing the impact of heightened deal activity in Q4 and a growing unfavorable FX impact.", "Third callout relates to the most recent U.S. payment volume trends. While rest of world payment volume and global cross-border trends remained in double-digit growth territory for the September ending quarter, U.S. domestic payment volume dropped from 11% growth in August to 8% in the month of September. While October's first three weeks have upticked slightly to 9%, there has currently been some constraint in U.S. consumer spend, showing up in our numbers in both debit and credit. Our guidance encompasses what we are seeing in September and October and presumes that a tepid recovery in U.S. economic growth continues.", "Fourth callout relates to operating income and EPS, which grew 15% and 20% respectively, versus fiscal 2012 adjusted results. Included in our Q4 results was a restructuring reserve of $44 million, representing about $0.04 of EPS. This restructuring reserve reflects a streamlining of our cost structure, aimed at achieving greater alignment between our costs and our strategic priorities, and capturing organizational efficiencies as we adapt to changes in our management structure.", "Finally, fifth callout -- we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Three highlights: First, as announced last week, we raised our quarterly dividend per share by 21% to $0.40. Second, during Q4, we repurchased over 7 million shares at an average price of $177 per share, returning $1.3 billion to shareholders. ", "Finally third, we announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program, our largest ever. Please note this buyback program has no expiration date and is in addition to $251 million, still remaining under our prior authorization. This means purchases could take place throughout fiscal 2014 and in 2015 as well.", "Now let's turn to the numbers. As is my practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the fiscal fourth quarter, followed by our results through October 21. I will then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2014.", "Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 13% on par with the June quarter's 13%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions. More recently in the U.S., through October 21, payment volume growth was 9% compared with 10% in the September ending quarter. ", "Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth was 9% through October 21, compared to 11% in Q4. Similarly, debit growth at 8% in October compared to 10% in Q4. While a decline in U.S. gas prices is part of the story, there is also a modest down shift in other retail segments.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter on par with the 11% rate in the June quarter. The U.S. grew 10% and the rest of world 11%. Through October 21st, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 13% with the U.S. growth rate of 10% and the rest of world at 14%.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $15.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 14% increase over the prior-year period. U.S. grew 10% while the rest of world delivered 28% growth. Through October 21st, processed transaction growth was 13%.", "Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, we strained by a significant increase in incentives tied to deal activity and a growing FX headwind. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $11.8 billion, up 13% over the prior year and at the high end of our beginning of the year guidance of low double digits.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.4 billion up 10% over the prior year and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions inside and outside the U.S. and continuing strong CyberSource transaction growth.", "As we signaled last quarter, we have fully lapped the implementation of U.S. debit regulation, resulting in revenue growth that more closely approximates growth in process transactions.", "International transaction revenue was up 13% to $899 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes and a continuing benefit from higher currency volatility. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up only 1% from the prior year results.", "Personnel costs were up 6% for the quarter and 12% year-over-year in support of our gross strategies around the globe, which heavily emphasized the investments in our country teams outside the U.S. along with our newer product initiatives. That said, in Q4, we also took a $44 million restructuring reserves for the reasons discussed earlier. This callout is important when considering a run rate for personnel cost as we move into fiscal year 2014.", "Marketing expenses were flat from the prior year and declined 6% sequentially primarily as a result of lower media spend. Operating margin was 59% for the fourth quarter and 61% for the full fiscal year, both in line with our guidance of around 60%. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 32.5% and well higher than our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%, the full year figure of 31.4% was within our guidance range.", "Capital expenditures were $138 million in the quarter and totaled $471 million for the full year. This was at the top end of our expected range going into the year.", "At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had 638 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted share is outstanding for the quarter, totaled $644 million and for the year totaled $656 million.", "Finally, in terms of guidance, we have previously provided fiscal $2014 metrics around revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Let\u2019s start there. Given our expectation for our significant FX headwind in 2014.", "We are reframing our revenue growth guidance going forward, leading with a constant dollar growth rate, which is consistent with the payment volume metrics we provide each quarter and better represents the underlying growth and health of our business. Then we will provide the expected FX impact for the year. So, for fiscal year 2014, we expect constant dollar revenue growth of low-double-digits and an FX headwind of around two percentage points. ", "A little further color on revenue. Given the continued slow pace of global economic recovery, combined with the growing impact of a strong U.S. dollar, our expectations today are slightly lower than they were in June on Investor Day. That said, our expectations for diluted earnings per share remains the same and continues to be mid to high-teens. ", "Free cash flow guidance of about $5 billion reflects the partial reversal of a 2013 tax deduction associated with the eventual return of Visa's share of the multi-district litigation cash payment, as a result of merchants opting out of the multi-district litigation class settlement. As I mentioned in June at Investor Day, this event, combined with the non-recurring deduction in fiscal 2013 associated with our multi-district litigation settlement payment, will lower free cash flow from $6.9 billion in fiscal 2013 to about $5 billion in fiscal 2014.", "New guidance metrics for the full year 2014 include the following. Client incentive, as a percentage of gross revenue, will move up modestly next year within an expected range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Our annual operating margin is expected to show a very modest improvement over the past couple of years, which means we expect it to remain in the low 60s.", "Finally, we have made the decision to discontinue providing quantitative guidance on marketing expense, capital expenditures and tax rate. We are moving in this direction because of the track record we have established since our IPO in 2008. Given the progress we have made with, and now the stability of these metrics, we deem them right for retirement.", "However, having said that, and to provide some parting color, we would view marketing and CapEx as likely increasing over time, commensurate with overall growth but at manageable rate. While we'll always seek opportunities to optimize our tax rate, we are not going to see the same magnitude of sustained improvement that we were able to drive in the first five years of our public life. We expect to see more modest incremental improvement only. ", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charlie Scharf ", "Thanks very much, Byron and good afternoon to everyone. I thought I would start with just a few comments about the fourth quarter and then move on to some other topics. First of all, we feel very good about the continued strong financial performance that Visa has exhibited with no surprises to speak of.", "As Byron mentioned, our revenue growth of 9% and on a gross basis at 11%, was reflective of heavy incentives during the quarter as we anticipated, and we just think of those as a good thing. That is getting more long-term deals signed with our clients, is clearly a positive for us. Global payment volume growth of 13%, consistent with the prior quarter, expense growth of 1%, as we talked about including $44 million of severance, 50% net income growth while we bought back 7 million shares for about $1.3 billion. ", "All this contributed to EPS growth of 20%, again including the effect of those incentives during the quarter and restructuring. All that added into the 2013 full year performance of 13% revenue growth, 8% expense growth, translating to 23% EPS growth all in line with the guidance that we've been giving. ", "Let me turn now and just give a couple of updates on other topics. And I'll start with litigation and regulation. First, I will start here in the United States. As I think most of you are aware, we are waiting final ruling on the MDL, the multi-district litigation case. A decision is expected at anytime. We continue to remain confident that the court will approve the agreement as we\u2019ve said in the past.", "Also within the United States, again I think most people do know that U.S. District Court Judge, Richard Leon ruled on July 31st that the Federal Reserve implement certain parts of the Durbin provision of Dodd-Frank in properly, specifically related to the level of interchange and at the networking provisions.", "Just a couple of comments on the judge Leon ruling. First of all, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve filed the notice of the appeal in August and that the Fed was granted a stay in July, pending the result of its appeal. Our review of the appeal papers filed by the Federal Reserve leads us to believe that the government has got a strong case on appeal relative to the timing as best as we know there is no timeline proposed for when the case will be argued or decided. However, the briefings are expected to be completed by the December 4th of this year. Over in Europe, we\u2019ve talked about a series of things there. In the past, there is really no new news with anything that we\u2019ve discussed, including the Visa Europe push.", "Let move on now and talk about tokenization for a minute. On the last quarterly call I spoke at length about our thoughts on tokenization and where we viewed our role. We made a significant announcement this quarter, which I hope you saw. We, along with our partners in the industry, MasterCard and American Express announced the set of standards to move toward a newly tokenized payment environment. This will serve several purposes.", "First of all, as we all know it\u2019s just good for security, removing sensitive information, crossing the payment system is good for every network participant. But probably more importantly for the long-term it creates a framework, as new network participants emerge to ensure the security and the integrity of the payment system is in fact maintained.", "And when I talk about the integrity of the payment system, I\u2019m including protecting the position that we have and our clients have in the value chain and that\u2019s something that\u2019s obviously very important to us. It\u2019s early days, they are just standards as they have been defined but we are working both on the technical implementation of this, as well as the practical implications with more to come in the future. But we think this could lead to some exciting things.", "Next update, I will turn to V.me for a second. We\u2019ve spoken before about the convergence of physical point-of-sale, e-commerce and mobile. You hear everywhere you go. Our objective is simple with V.me. It\u2019s, people talk about wallet sometimes is if they are very confusing to us and what our goals are, they are very, very simple and straight forward.", "We want to replicate the simplicity, the speed and the security of a transaction just like people have today when they swipe, dip or tap a card. It\u2019s that simple. We\u2019ve learned a great deal since I arrived at Visa through discussions with issuers, acquirers and merchants relative to our own development of V.me, and we are in the process of simplifying our product, becoming targeted towards the goal of creating the simple, fast and secure online and mobile acceptance.", "The feedback has been hugely valuable. Our product is going to be issuer, acquirer and merchant focused that\u2019s relative to the blending and the data flow. We are working to make it easier to integrate into merchant websites and into mobile applications and we\u2019ve done this in collaboration with our clients and the feedback has been positive and we are optimistic.", "Having said that, we have made significant progress, we have over a 150 financial institutions and about 60 e-commerce retailers offering V.me within United States, Canada and Australia today and we have an additional 300 merchants signed and are in various stages of integration.", "We move on now and just talk for a second about network security. In my year here as I\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to talk to many of you and read many things that gets sent across about what's going on in our industry, there is a great deal discussed about the potential disintermediation of existing payment systems. And just relative to network security I just -- I want to make clear that I don\u2019t think people should underestimate the value existing payment networks have regarding security.", "Criminals across the globe are becoming, they are more of them, they are becoming smarter, they are better funded and they are becoming more vault. Their tax are becoming more frequent and much, much more complex. We as a company and the established people in the marketplace here have been dealing with these risks for years, in our case 40 to 50 years.", "We've invested billions of dollars to secure our network. And you just have to remind yourself, people use networks because they trust them and they will use them until they don't trust them anymore. And then when they don't, those networks won't exist. We understand that and work every day to protect our environment and just keep in mind that risk takes several forms. The first is just practical day-to-day fraud. We spend an awful lot of energy working on our data analytics as our clients do despite (inaudible) just a common everyday fraud.", "Our transactions are screened by us and our financial partners on a real-time basis. The modeling to do this has been developed over 40 to 50 years and we have driven fraud rates down to historic lows, at the point where they are less than $0.06 for every $100 transacted over our network or actually lost to fraud.", "The second risk is the scary one and it's perpetrators getting access to the network. Just remind everyone that we have a centralized processing architecture that allows us to scan, evaluate, protect, and react to any risk that we see as necessary. As a company as I said, huge resources, huge amount of our time as a management team and we have some of the most talented people and sophisticated technology to combat threats and are committed to continue investing in this.", "As we think about these risks, again I just wanted to point out these risks are very real. These aren\u2019t things that are people are concerned about that might never come to fruition, they will go to the weakest link in the system. As I think most of you know the White House is directly engaged in this as is the President himself and we certainly feel that having secure environment like our established payments network is a great place to be as these risks continue to increase.", "Now let me just turn and just talk for a second about almost a year that I have spent at Visa and just share a few of my thoughts. And some of these -- many of these don't relate to anything that I've done but relate to the broader team at Visa. First of all, this company has delivered growth consistently and delivered on what it said it would do since the IPO. I personally remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise over the long term. The opportunities are hugely significant; they are global, they are technology driven, and they are based on partnerships that we have and we will continue to strengthen across the globe.", "First of all on Globality. Again I had the opportunity since I have joined the company to spend a lot of time overseas. I visited over a dozen countries, I probably met with 40 to 50 financial institutions from the very largest to some of the very smallest, met with two dozen acquirers, met with many merchants and government officials in five countries. You all know and I think we talked about this that our business outside the U.S. is growing at a rate much faster than inside the U.S., but the opportunities within both are still hugely significant.", "We talked at Investor Day that the displacement of cash is still the big opportunity for us. 41% of transactions in the developed world are still cash and check. 62% in the emerging markets that translates to over 11 trillion of cash and check in our geographies, which excludes Visa Europe and those numbers are growing. What's been most striking to me as I have had the opportunity to travel across the world is the extent to which governments understand the huge benefits of moving payments to electronic means and the desired to partner with us to bring about this change and that's in fact what we're doing.", "As I just alluded to technology is also a huge driver of the opportunity we have in front of us. Cash is in fact the enemy. Electronic solutions just are far superior, they are safer, they are more secure. We have some of the best products in the world. Our products are accepted to include mobile point of acceptance between 36 million and 40 million locations across the globe. We have over 2.1 billion cards outstanding, a full set of products and again a tradition of safety, security and soundness.", "We all know data and mobile create the opportunity to accelerate that electronification and we have continued and will continue to build out our capabilities here. We've also talked a lot about partnership. Our clients are much more than clients, they are partners. Our issuers have always looked at us that way that we are strategic partner for them in building their business. When we talk to a lot of people on the outside, they like to talk about the price of our network.", "When we talk to most of our issuers, absolutely they're concerned about price but they are equally concerned about the ideas and the assets that we can bring to help them grow their client relationships and that\u2019s what we spend our time inside the company working to develop, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been -- it's what been done for years.", "The same is true for the acquirers. And I have said we are building the DNA in these capabilities to create those kinds of merchant partnerships that we do have in some parts of the world but we need certainly here in the United States and elsewhere.", "We have a long way to go. We know it\u2019s critical for our success but we do want to be viewed as a partner to grow their business at a fair price, and we will be flexible. We will customize our efforts here as long as we preserve the things that I talked about. They are important to us and the network. And in short, we feel great about the future. So everything we\u2019ve been talking about -- about our future is still in fact the same.", "Let me just shift gears now and just talk for a second about capital. Since our IPO, we\u2019ve been consistent about how we have thought about capital management. And since I\u2019ve come on board, I have reaffirmed the same principles that have existed within the company.", "To date, the company has repurchased the equivalent of about 151 million shares or about 20% of the company\u2019s shares outstanding. We\u2019ve returned nearly 17 billion of capital for shareholders. Let me just walk through a couple of principles which I laid out on our prior call but let me just do it again.", "We believe the highest and best use of our excess capital is reinvesting it first organically in our business, then through acquisitions to further our growth. After supporting that growth, we believe in continuing to grow our dividend and we think about targeting a 20% payout ratio of prior year net income. The final use is buying back our stock, just a few notes for a second.", "We treat decisions to invest our capital for both organic and acquisition purposes of series independent discrete decisions. And we conduct vigorous analysis on all of those. And so we get excited when we find investments whether they are organic investments or acquisitions that has those tests and we are constantly searching for ways to grow those things.", "We also understand the value of the consistent and fair dividend to our investors. So our goal is to grow the dividend as our net income grows. And our stated goal has been and continues to be to return the majority of excess free cash flow through our investors.", "We\u2019ve done this through aggressive buybacks and we will continue to do this always with an eye towards valuation. We understand that when we buy our stock back we are making an investment decision and to the extent that we are buying the stock back that tells you what we believe the future of this company is like.", "As you\u2019ve seen, we continued that practice through this quarter. We announced the 21% increase in our dividend from $0.33 per share per quarter to $0.40 per share. This equates to 20% of that prior year net income as I alluded to earlier and that\u2019s the way we think about it.", "We also announced our tenth and most significant share repurchase authorization to date, about -- which was $5 billion. Both of these decisions, as I said reflects our belief in returning excess capital to shareholders and in our confidence of our future. And speaking of the future, just a few last words, before we open it up for questions.", "Byron commented that through August 21st, we\u2019ve seen solid payment in transaction growth across the world, some weakness here in the U.S. with some strong growth elsewhere. As we said, the recovery had not accelerated and certainly continues as you look across the world and our financial guidance reflects this tepid global growth and volatility in the foreign exchange markets. We do expect one day to benefit from stronger economic growth, we just don\u2019t know when yet.", "Looking ahead to 2014 and beyond, I continue to remain excited and energized about Visa and the opportunity that we had to continue growing the business from the topline. We continue to focus on the same initiatives that we outlined at the Investor Day. The secular opportunity to penetrate cash and check, PCE remains healthy across the globe.", "We are working hard to expand the value of VisaNet. We are continuing to invest in our future and we continue to think about being more flexible and adapted to the business needs of our customers as we seek to become closer partners with them.", "So on closing, I would just like to thank the 9,500 global employees of Visa who are all working hard every single day to build a better company for all of our shareholders. And with that operator, Byron and I would love to take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. ", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies", "So just on the currency, I know it's unusual if you guys have a callout of this magnitude. Is it mostly the volatility in the Brazilian real or are there some other specific currencies and you simply didn't enough hedging in place? And then just as a follow on to that, does the top-line impact that we saw in Q4 and that we are projecting for fiscal '14, is that similar impact on the bottom line?", "Byron Pollitt", "So, let me respond to that. So on currency, I'll just remind everyone, we hedge one year out on a rolling basis. So literally every month, we put hedges on, hedges come off. So we'll never be perfectly matched with regards to our foreign exchange exposure, unless literally there is no volatility whatsoever in the rate. We hedge 14 currencies, we do business in 180. The impact does include the Brazilian reais but it is more than that. It includes the Aussie dollar, the yen, the Canadian dollar. ", "So there are a handful of currencies that have -- that are causing this impact, not just limited to Brazil. The primary impact is revenue. There is a more modest offset in expenses. Obviously, expenses incurred in other currencies that are brought back to the U.S. dollar actually translate at a lower level. So the impact on the bottom line is moderated by the expense benefit but it doesn't moderate it all that much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. ", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Couple of questions. First, the high deal volume in the fiscal fourth quarter. Could you please discuss, if you can, the pricing trajectory and high level for those deals versus what you were seeing during the rest of 2013? And secondly just thinking about growth outside the U.S. we're hearing that the Mexican banks are lobbying hard for Visa and MasterCard to be allowed to process locally. Any thoughts on those discussions or the timeline for that? ", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me take the first one. When we gave our guidance on the Q3 call, when we guided to 16% to 17% incentives for the year, the incentive rate that we ended up incurring in Q4 is very, very consistent with that guidance and very consistent with how we expected deals to sort out. And as it relates to pricing, I would say there is no major callout here on pricing. I think the perspective we would leave you with is we were pretty much spot on in the end of year and Q4 incentive guidance, which should give you some comfort around how we anticipated those deals to be priced.", "The reason as I alluded to in my remarks -- the reason that the incentives are so high is because we did a significantly higher number of important deals in that quarter -- something that's not unusual. So our incentives are lumpy and we don't guide by quarter, we guide on the full year. And so that's the perspective we would offer on that front. Charlie, do you want to pick Mexico?", "Charlie Scharf", "Sure, on Mexico, certainly and I think if you think back to the Investor Day, Bill Sheedy talked a great deal about what we believe as the opportunity outside of the United States to increasing our processing penetration. Mexico is certainly one of those markets. I've been there and we\u2019ve had the conversation about the value that we think our processing capabilities can bring to the banks. And so we are hopeful and trying to be helpful that our processing capabilities will be useful in that marketplace.", "Just unrelated note on Mexico because I didn't cover it in my remarks but I do think it's an exciting thing for us. We announced today that we\u2019ve signed an agreement with the joint venture between Grupo Bimbo, which is the largest Mexican owned baking company and Blue Label Telecoms Limited, which is a leading provider of prepaid airtime. The significance is we\u2019ve also talked a great deal about the opportunity to increase acceptance in the markets that aren\u2019t as developed as United States.", "This is an opportunity for us to work with the capacity that Bimbo has and potentially add up to a 150,000 point-of-sale terminals using their distribution capabilities. So it\u2019s something that we are very excited about and when we think about increasing acceptance, we think about processing. It\u2019s certainly one of the bigger opportunities for us.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from -- yes, so the next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMC. Your line is open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMC", "Great. Thanks. Just on the incentive line, the 73 major deals, how many of these were new deals for Visa versus renewals? And then I guess, looking at \u201914, should we expect a more normal year for deal activity?", "Byron Pollitt", "Well, I don\u2019t have it immediately handy, how many were new versus renewals. What I can provide is additional color is the majority of those were outside the United States with a heavy focus on the Asia-Pacific and CEMEA region. With regards to \u201914, I\u2019m not quite sure what a normal year would be, but we are giving you our guidance relative to incentives. And what I can say is that if you look at it, say from the perspective of our top 10 global clients, none of those are scheduled for exploration or renewals in the upcoming year \u201914.", "Charlie Scharf", "And I just wanted to add to that, what Byron said earlier, which is again, we don\u2019t guide quarterly on incentives because we know it\u2019s going to be lumpy and this -- while it\u2019s a large number, not a surprise to us. And again to the extent that we are signing up people either earlier or more of them, we think those are good things. And over the course of the year, those things tend to balance out, which is why we provided the guidance that we provided for 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital. You may go ahead.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital", "Thanks. So as we think about \u201914, little bit more on the incremental investment side, you mentioned a lot of things going on here. But you did highlight previously that about 80% of your investments incrementally up to this point have been on products, technology and infrastructure and the remaining 20% was kind of on international markets. And I\u2019m just wondering it sounds like it might be tilting more towards international markets and should we expect kind of the incremental margins from that to be similar, better or worse because your margin guidance for me seem like it was biased to the upside? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "See, how do we respond to that? I think that if you were to -- I think those ratios continued to work. I would say that when we talk about 80% of investment going into product, a lot of that is capital. When you think of the investment that goes into rest of world and in countries outside other than the United States and we think of headcount, a lot of that is going into our country teams and we consider those investments because more people were at our best when we are present locally serving clients locally.", "And so the margins are highest when we are leveraging transactions over the network in our core businesses. And they are less when we are investing in products and services that begin to move away from the network. They extend the network but they don't directly -- they are transactions that require additional investment and additional costs in order to drive the transactions to the network. And so the way we talked about it, I think on Investor Day is probably a good way of continuing to think about it over -- in '14 and '15. Charlie, do you want to add anything?", "Charlie Scharf", "The only color I\u2019d add is where you round up which is -- as we sit here today and we obviously -- we have our plans for next year and all the glorious detail that you would expect, we don't look at the distribution of those investments as being at all significantly different than we thought at investor day. It's still the same set of opportunities, the growth opportunities outside the U.S. have been hugely significant for this company. It's where the majority of the headcount growth has been over a period of time. So we would expect where we invest to look very similar as we develop the products and services that we talked about.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. ", "Darrin Peller - Barclays", "Just when we look at the volume trends through September and October, first of all, I mean just comment on some of the moving parts here in terms of maybe the government shutdown impact thing or any other variables? And then when you think about your '14 guidance, is that inclusive of this kind of a run rate for the U.S. trending maybe in the 8% range versus the 9% range versus what you have seen in past few months?", "Byron Pollitt", "So on the U.S. side, I would say it is continuation -- as we said in the remarks, it is the continuation of a tepid recovery. And so somewhere in the zip code of what we have been seeing is what we would expect to see going forward. And I'm sorry the first part of your question was the government?", "Charlie Scharf", "Yes, so I'll just repeat what Byron said. He also said this in his opening remarks, which is that our guidance encompasses what we are seeing in September and October. And as Byron said that our guidance presumes that we do have this tepid recovery of the U.S. economy. And then what\u2019s relative to the government, it certainly appears from our -- looking at our information that the government shutdown certainly has an impact, very hard to prove, very hard to understand exactly what the impact is. So it's more guess than anything else. And certainly to the extent that the U.S. government can get its act together on the debt limit and on the budget, we would expect that to change the trajectory of what we would see for consumer spend.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. ", "Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research", "Charlie, given your experience at a place that was impacted by Dodd-Frank's debit regulation and the looming second round of potential actions here, can you just put your bank hat on and share with us your views as, if this does go through how issuers may approach their response to further debit interchange reductions and/or loss of exclusivity on signature and how could that impact the networks?", "Charlie Scharf", "Sure. I'll answer the question relative to in my current job conversations that we have had with issuers and our sense for the way people are thinking about it. Listen I think; first of all relative to the level of interchange, it certainly depends on where the rule ultimately comes out. When issuers first were dealing with the Durbin reduction down to $0.22, there was a lot of talk that went into people's desire to support the product and the $0.22, while people don't make much money on the product, the consumers like the product. And they still felt the need to support it and we see strong debit growth at that point.", "As the number drops, if the number drops significantly below that, people do have to rethink what that means. We always have to remind ourselves that we can sit around and talk about what we like and our issuers can do the same. But there are customers on the other end that are using these products. And consumers like debit cards, they like to segregate their money. They like to have control over what they spend relative to the amount of money that\u2019s in their bank account and all of the safeguards, checks, alerts and all the things that go along with that.", "And forcing consumer behavior to change is a very hard and very dangerous thing to do and not one, that I think -- at least if I could tell banks take it lightly. So we\u2019re still depending on where the numbers come out confident that the support will still be there and for some reason, people chose to look another way. There are very good prepaid products in the market place which are -- could be important drivers of their business and our business as is the case with credit cards.", "And we just remind ourselves, the credit card business is very different than it was 10 years ago. Credit card companies are predominantly controlled by banks that look at the entirety of the relationship. And the entirety of that relationship allows them to make credit decisions that they wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable making years and years ago and to the extent that they can make those credit decisions, put controls and alert some parameters around that, that consumers like, that certainly an option.", "So lots of things unfolding here. Obviously it depends on where the appeal turn itself up. And then just relative to network routing, I guess, the only thing I\u2019d say on that one is, that one is very complicated. It\u2019s not clear that the system is capable of handling that today. The system, we thought about broadly whether it\u2019s physical devices, whether its networks, whether its acquirers, processors or anything like that. And so that one, I think we will -- we will wait and see what happens in the appeal scored and go forward from there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW", "Thank you. Just a question back on the U.S. spending trends. I was wondering if there was more elaboration around the trends. Byron, you mentioned certain verticals being impact as well. I was wondering maybe what those verticals were and maybe what consumer segments you might have seen the impact. And then just one data point question, when I look at the card service, the purchase volume ratio that declined a lot more in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter. And I was just wondering if you could just help me with what might have attributed to that. Thank you.", "Byron Pollitt", "With regards to the softening in the U.S. retail spend, clearly gas is important. We are looking in an average price per gallon in October of $3.36 which for us is 12% below where it was at the same time a year ago.", "And that shows up in a significant way in the shortfall, I would say other verticals that show up, supermarkets, various elements of travel, a number of categories that we would traditionally associate with small business. And when you look at the spread, its pretty broad based with and I would almost say after gas that what -- I think what struck us with how many categories you would naturally associate with small business.", "With regards to the second part of your question, I\u2019m not familiar with the ratio that you\u2019re enquiring about. Could you rephrase that real quick?", "Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW", "I guess, I look at card service revenues to purchase volume. Card service fees to purchase volume and that ratio is kind of in the -- it was like 12.67% relative to the 12. -- like 12.75 last quarter. And when I look at the year-over-year decline, that decline was a little bit more than what we saw last quarter?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes. It\u2019s a metric we don\u2019t typically look at -- so this is service fee over PV. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at to the extent that we have been adjusting our pricing so that more of what we book ends up in data processing versus service fees as well as the case with a major U.S. bank that recently signed up for 10 years. That would impact that ratio but beyond that, I don't really have a comment. But we will look at that and see whether there is some additional insight that we can address in our future call. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Yes. I just wanted to inquire more about the restructuring actions. Can you just provide more specifics on what the restructuring actions were and what prompted them? And also whether there is more to come. And then I guess related to this on a more strategic level, does the need for some restructuring recently -- meaning you\u2019re needing more levers to keep your margin trajectory, it seems that given the inherent operating leverage in your business, you probably don't need significant restructuring to hit your margin target at this point but I wanted to enquire about that in case we are missing something.", "Charlie Scharf", "I mean just -- let me start -- we don't believe in using restructuring to manage margins. We use restructuring, if there are things that we want to do to right-size different parts of the company. This is not expected to continue, doesn't mean that we won't learn things as time goes on and decide to move resources around the company but that's exactly what this is. The majority of this restructuring comes from a sharpened focus on what we are doing in our global products area. As you know we have had some leadership changes there over the past couple of months. We spent a lot of time, I referenced in my remarks, talking with our clients about what we are doing, what they want from us and where they want us to focus.", "And that has directed us to reorient our activities and I think of that by the way as just those activities as normal practice. If we are innovating enough, if we are doing enough things, some of those things will turn out not to be to have all of the opportunity in them and we will course correct and that's what we've done here. So, I think that answers all of your sub-questions. Byron, did I cover everything?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes. I think that's good.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. ", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Just a quick follow-up to the tokenization discussion that you talked about earlier. Just wondering what is the process timeline for it to move from being a proposal to being a standard and can you talk about the timing on when these standards could potentially get implemented?", "Charlie Scharf", "That is a good question. I would be less than accurate if I was too specific. The standards have been published. We have continued to put out some guidelines to our clients as to what fields will have to be available in releases that will come out next year, because this tokenization work requires work of acquirers and processors. And we would hope that some of these solutions would be in the marketplace by the second half of the calendar year, next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research", "I just want to -- could you expand again on the spending changes that you see changes in signature, on your high end credit cards, you talked about affluent consumers driving a lot of the spending in the past. Did that change in September, October as well? And I wondered could you just give us an update at the end of the period in terms of what signature debit contribution is to volume revenue and the earnings?", "Byron Pollitt", "We don't typically break it down between signature or what we refer to now as Visa Debit versus Interlink. I think the important callout here is that we are now lapping the full implementation of Durbin where we had a year where there was a significant and a permanent loss of debit share as a result of the routing. And that's now in our base and so as we begin to lap that, the debit numbers are going to look a whole lot healthier growth numbers than they did a year ago.", "With regards to specific reference to the affluent, I would -- as we have articulated previously, this remains an affluent led recovery. To the extent that there maybe some lift on debit, at least in the U.S. that would partially be do to a shift from credit to debit as a result of a drop in gasoline pricing.", "As the price of the fill up gets more within range of immediately accessible fund, it has been our -- it has been our experience that we will see some shift from credit to debit. But that\u2019s a result of the drop in oil prices and since they are in drop mode, that something we wouldn\u2019t surprise, if we saw at the next three [quarters].", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bill Carache of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.", "Bill Carache - Nomura Securities", "Thank you. Charlie, some investors have expressed concern over the inevitability of slower growth at some point, say, the next few years, given that just mathematically you are growing up such a large base? Can you talk about, your confidence and the sustainability of the current mid to high-teens growth as you look to the future? And perhaps comment on whether an eventual slowdown is something that you worry about or is the runaway for growth so large that is not even something that crosses your mind?", "Charlie Scharf", "Well, I think, when you show, when you are new at a company that is growing like this. It\u2019s something that you think a lot about and you look a lot about. So, absolutely, it\u2019s something that as I gotten here, I\u2019ve -- I don\u2019t know whether worry is the right word, but certainly spent a lot of time on.", "Listen, I don\u2019t think that the opportunities for this company are significantly different than they were four, five years ago. In fact we believe that there are things going on in the marketplace that would suggest that that both -- that the opportunities are broader.", "And I am speaking out, I am not, and again I said this, I know, we are -- well, we are concerned about our quarters and we are concerned about our years. We give guidance. We understand the importance of that. But here we are talking about, our belief that this company can continue to grow for the long-term.", "The dynamics that exist with cash and check across the globe is a gigantic opportunity. It will take us. I know -- I don\u2019t even know how long it will take us to actually conquer cash and check across the globe. But it\u2019s a very, very long period of time.", "We also look at all the things that are going on in the world of technology that people initially get concerned about relative to our position. The majority of them we look at and believe there are hugely valuable to us.", "The network that we have, as I\u2019ve said, it is really, really, really hard to duplicate what we have. A couple of people have networks like this. There always going to be niche players out there, but to tackle the global opportunity that exists in growing payments. You need to have the size and the scale that some of us have. And so this is, one of, the world\u2019s great platform to be able do that.", "And I don\u2019t feel any worse. In fact, I probably feel better about the long-term growth opportunities from a revenue perspective of the company today than when I first joined and that\u2019s consistent with what I thought at Investor Day.", "Jack Carsky", "Brad, at this point, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Arvind Ramnani of BNP. Your line is open.", "Arvind Ramnani - BNP", "Hi. Just one final question, if the Visa believe in kind of being a partner with the issuers, merchants and acquirers, then why there are so many groups out there kind of putting hundreds of millions of dollars into finding a way on Visa? Why is Visa not offering them what they want anyway so badly?", "Charlie Scharf", "All right. Well, we\u2019ll just spend some time with you offline because we\u2019ve talked a lot about and I think, I have been very, very open and honest about our need to do business somewhat differently in some parts of the world than we have done it in the past.", "So there is no question that the participants in the network have to do a better job of balancing out the role of the issuers, the acquirers and merchants. We have not treated them as partners as much as we possibly could, especially in the United States, again other parts of the world we get a very, very different story.", "And at the heart of a lot of the disagreements that we had, I -- we certainly believe that we have got the opportunity to change the nature of that relationship and that\u2019s why we formed the group under Elizabeth Buse called Global Solution were dedicated to showing up with solutions to help them, grow their business over period of time. I have also said, this is not going to take one month, one quarter or even a couple of quarters. It is going to take a period of time.", "But, listen, we have the tools, we have the assets and we have the desire to do that. And it\u2019s on us to change nature of those relationships. We started those conversations and overtime, it will be very easy to judge our success. But it\u2019s certainly something that we are excited about because we know that we can add a great deal of value to merchant community.", "So, with that, I guess, I\u2019ll just wrap up it and thank everyone for taking the time and for the effort and following our stock.", "Jack Carsky", "That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all very much and if you have any follow up questions feel free to give myself or Victoria a call.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, head of global investor relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky ", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s chief executive officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s chief financial officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as a result of variety of factors. Additional information concerning these factors is available in our most reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the investor relations section of Visa\u2019s website.", "For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the Financial and Statistical Summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thank you, Jack. We will begin my call with the usual callouts and observations. First, let me start with payment volume and cross-border trends. The December quarter, on a constant dollar basis, grew payment volume at 11%, down 2 percentage points from the September quarter.", "This softening was led by a 2 percentage point drop in the U.S. from 10% to 8%, with the holiday spend consistent with a continuing U.S. economic recovery, but at a growth rate we would describe as tepid.", "U.S. results for the first 21 days of January were consistent with the December quarter. International payment volume growth rates in the December quarter remained healthy, in the mid-teens.", "On the cross-border front, growth picked up 1 percentage point from the September quarter, with both U.S. and international on the uptick. That said, January appears to be giving back some of the heightened cross-border activity we saw in the month of December.", "Second callout: let me begin by saying that we are affirming all our guidance metrics outlined on our October call. With that as perspective, I would like to elaborate on our net revenue growth guidance. ", "Our guidance calls for low double-digits on a constant dollar basis offset by about 2 percentage points of negative FX. We define low double-digits as 10% to 13%. This means on an as-reported or nominal basis, growth is expected to be in the 8% to 11% range after FX impacts. ", "On the FX front, after adjusting for hedges, we expect about 2 percentage points of negative impact in all four fiscal quarters. Given Visa\u2019s relevant basket of currencies, the forward rates indicate continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the balance of the fiscal year.", "Drilling down a bit further, a stronger U.S. dollar versus the currencies for Japan, Brazil, Australia, and Canada, and more recently Argentina and Venezuela, have driven our headwind. In contrast, while the euro has strengthened versus the U.S. dollar, the absence of Europe from Visa, Inc.\u2019s geographic portfolio has muted this potential benefit.", "Staying with revenue but switching gears, the quarterly growth rates for the balance of the year are expected to vary, with softer growth rates in Q2 and Q3, followed by an uptick in Q4. This cadence is driven by the following: the lapping of particularly strong revenue growth rates in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year, which benefited from low levels of client incentives and certain nonrecurring pricing actions, all of which were called out in last year\u2019s earnings calls. In contrast, Q4 of last year had a disproportionate share of the fiscal year\u2019s client incentives, which is a pattern that, at this point in the year, we do not expect to repeat. ", "The third callout relates to the quarterly cadence for marketing spend. With the Winter Olympics rapidly approaching and World Cup soon to follow, we expect a significant uptick in marketing spend in Q2 and Q3 versus our spend in Q1, followed by a downshift in Q4. This, of course, will have an impact on quarterly operating margins. ", "Fourth callout is the return of litigation escrow funds from those merchants opting out of the recently approved class action settlement, the dynamics of which we covered at our investor day in June and reiterated last quarter. On January 27, $1.1 billion was returned to us and was deposited back into our litigation escrow account. The receipt of the payment increases our current taxable income by $1.1 billion and income tax payables by $387 million.", "While it has no direct effect on our income statement, it negatively impacts our free cash flow over the last three quarters of fiscal 2014. This event was fully contemplated and is reflected in our full year guidance of about $5 billion in free cash flow. To be clear, the return of the actual escrow funds is not included in our free cash flow, but the impact of higher cash taxes is included.", "Last callout: as always, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 5.5 million shares during the quarter, at an average price per share of $199 and change. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of 4.2 billion.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the numbers. I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal first quarter, followed by our results through January 21. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our first fiscal quarter.", "Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter\u2019s 13%. The U.S. grew 8%, and international grew 15%. More recently, in the U.S., through January 21, payment volume continued at 8%.", "Drilling down further, U.S. credit was 10% in both Q1 and through January 21, compared to 11% in Q4. Similarly, U.S. debit grew at 7% in both Q1 and through January 21, compared to 10% in Q4.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 12% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, up modestly from the 11% rate in the September quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and international 13% in constant dollars.", "Through January 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10% with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and international 11%. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $16 billion in the first fiscal quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year period. The U.S. grew 9% while international delivered 26% growth. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 11%. ", "Now turning to the income statement, net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, an 11% increase year over year driven primarily by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2% FX headwind.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the past year, and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue, $1.3 billion, up 13% over the prior year quarter, based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "International transaction revenue was up 11% to $891 million, reflecting an ongoing broad-based strength in cross-border volume. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 3% from the prior year.", "Given earlier discussion on the cadence of marketing spend, we expect expense growth in Q2 and Q3 to be somewhat higher versus Q1. Operating margin was 66% for the first quarter, ahead of our yearly guidance of low 60s, but consistent with our expectations. We expect Q1 to be our lowest quarter for operating expense in fiscal 2014.", "Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.4%. Capital expenditures were $120 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 634 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis, and the weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 639 million.", "Finally, as noted earlier, our full year guidance metrics for revenue growth, client incentives, operating margin, EPS growth, and free cash flow remain unchanged. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charlie Scharf", "Thank you very much, Byron, and good morning to everyone. First, let me just start by saying that we feel very good about the strong financial performance during the quarter, as Byron had mentioned: solid revenue growth, solid net income growth, and solid earnings per share growth. ", "Global payment volume, as you can see from the numbers, is relatively strong. Holiday spend in the U.S. was better than reported as we were going through the holiday season, and was certainly impacted by the shorter calendar. It was extremely uneven as we were going through it, and the continued movement from face-to-face to digital purchases was extremely meaningful.", "Let me just give you some updates on the legal and regulatory front. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read, on December 13, U.S. District Judge Gleeson granted final approval of the merchant litigation cases. As part of the settlement, Visa and the other defendants received a comprehensive release of liability to claims in the lawsuit, as well as protection against further litigation regarding interchange and other U.S. rules. As expected, a number of objectors to the settlement have appealed. ", "We at Visa are very focused on concluding these disagreements and on building our efforts to enter into a better relationship with the entire merchant community, identifying new ways to enable them to differentiate themselves and their customer experiences, and competing more effectively. ", "Also, about two weeks ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit heard oral arguments and the Fed\u2019s appeal of Judge Leon\u2019s decision in the challenge to the Durbin regulations. While it\u2019s hard to make any courtroom predictions, as we all know, we\u2019re pleased with the hearing. We continue to believe that the government has a strong case on appeal.", "Let me move on and just talk for a second about some topics of interest and start with the recent industry data breaches. First of all, we understand that these events are terrible for everyone affected. Everyone is the merchant, the issuer, the acquirer, the networks, but most importantly the consumer.", "And while the consumers are generally protected by the network rules of zero liability, meaning they\u2019re not responsible for any fraud due to the breach, we all have to realize that these compromises are disturbing to them, they\u2019re inconvenient, and they raise broader data security concerns that the entire industry must solve. ", "Unfortunately, many merchants, issuers, and both of their lobbyists are attempting to assign blame in the press and not reacting in a particularly constructive manner, and it\u2019s in all of our best interests that this change quickly. Within the payments ecosystem, the impact on the merchants, the acquirer, the issuer, and the network are all equally negative. ", "We all share the same customer, who\u2019s going through this difficult experience, and our sales and long term relationships with that customer will suffer if we don\u2019t work together to get to a better place. The appropriate way to respond to this issue for all parties to jointly work together toward better data security standards and better payment security standards. Maintaining trust in the electronic payment systems is our highest priority, and we\u2019re actively exploring new ways to enhance the safety and security of the payment system. ", "To that end, we do believe it\u2019s critical that we make progress toward the implementation of EMV Chip in the U.S. We can\u2019t do this on our own. We need merchants, acquirers, and issuers to be supportive. We know it\u2019s expensive. It means new cards, new terminals, new software development, but as we can all see, it is necessary.", " It\u2019s our hope that all issuers and merchants will migrate to EMV, but we also understand that it\u2019s complex. There are an awful lot of terminals out there and an awful lot of cards that have to be updated, and this has to be done in a way that does not disturb commerce.", "In 2011, we had announced a plan to migrate the U.S. to EMV technology through a liability shift beginning in October 2015 and we have reaffirmed these dates. EMV, to be clear, would potentially eliminate the ability to reproduce the card and thereby reduce if not eliminate counterfeit fraud at the point of sale, but it\u2019s also important to note that it\u2019s equally imperative that the industry move towards tokenization, which should be equally effective at reducing or eliminating card not present fraud.", "As we work towards a better solution, we\u2019re also redoubling our efforts to make sure that consumers understand that they\u2019re protected. We\u2019ve invested in national advertising to reassure customers of the zero liability fraud protection. These important protections shield our consumers in the U.S. from bearing any fraud loss after data compromise, as I said before.", "We\u2019re also focused on making sure that there\u2019s clarity of fact with the media and in Washington. I\u2019m personally concerned about the amount of misinformation you read in the public domain, from confusion around who incurs the cost of fraud losses, to the misrepresented lack of payment system security. ", "This is misleading, inaccurate, and not helpful, and can have unintended public policy consequences. We\u2019re actively engaged with policymakers in Washington, DC, along with our partners, to ensure that they actually hear the facts and understand the multiple layers of infrastructure that protect the payment system. ", "Let me just switch topics for a second and just talk for a second about V.me, which we\u2019ve done on several calls. On the last quarterly call, I spoke about our efforts to simplify what we\u2019re building. Since launching it, we\u2019ve learned valuable lessons, as we\u2019ve talked about, to accelerate its success in the marketplace and better meet the needs of what our issuers and merchants actually want in the marketplace. ", "We\u2019ve been working hard to evolve the product in response to what we\u2019ve heard from them, which is to simplify the merchant integration and focus on the simplicity of consumer card payments for online and mobile transactions. We\u2019re pleased that the work is now coming to market, with the first phase of our redesigned platform released last week, providing merchants with faster integration and easier time to market. ", "I can share now that Jos A. Bank, Ticketmaster, Auto Zone, and Petco will be some of the first merchants to go live withV.me through this new, simplified integration. These new merchants join the strong group of existing merchants and financial institutions already offering V.me to their consumers, which represent over $13 billion in spend and approximately $300 million in addressable cards.", "And we\u2019ve talked about that our success here at Visa does depend on the strength of our relationships with all parties in the payment system. We value all of those relationships, and we continue to work hard to solidify those relationships. ", "As we\u2019ve talked about, we reorganized the company last year to strengthen our outreach to all of those constituents. To that end, we have made good progress and our track record of winning or renewing issuer and cobrand contracts is excellent. ", "Let me just talk for a second about our cobrand business, because we\u2019ve gotten a series of questions from that as we\u2019ve met with you all. Let me just talk about, because the U.S. is far and away the majority of where the cobrand market is, and just talk about some of the effects for us in our fiscal 2013 year, looking backwards. ", "Just remember, we have the leading cobrand market share. Most cobrands do not go to RFP, and when we look on a volume-weighted basis at our renewals, we renewed about 95% of our current cobrand deals that were actually up for renewal. We also won about 60% of the new cobrand deals on a volume-weighted basis. As we said at investor day, seven of the top U.S. cobrands are a majority of Visa.", "So when you look at those numbers, we\u2019re very pleased with the business that we\u2019ve had and the rate of success we continue to have in the marketplace, and our cobrand pipeline is very healthy in fiscal 2014 and beyond, as we look ahead.", "Let me just change gears for a second and just share with you some facts about our new platform: Everywhere You Want to Be, which is a new integrated campaign that communicates our vision and how our brand is positioned for the future. Those of you who have been covering us for a while may remember we once used the tagline Visa, it\u2019s Everywhere You Want to Be, to reflect the growing presence of Visa in merchant locations across the United States. ", "Today, the new global campaign allows us to expand what \u201ceverywhere\u201d means and build upon the historical equities of the brand. We\u2019re bringing this new Visa brand and our mark to light gradually, starting with Olympic-themed advertising in the U.S. and a rollout to more markets and audiences around the world, starting in March.", "So I\u2019m going to conclude just by reaffirming our view here of how excited we are about the future and the opportunity. We\u2019ve talked about the secular opportunity to penetrate cash and check and how healthy that opportunity is across the entire globe. We continue to work on innovation, being flexible and adaptive in the world we live in, both for our existing customers and continuing to open up the network on the edges to embrace the change that\u2019s going on around us.", "And with that, I\u2019m going to open up the floor for questions to Byron and myself. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. ", "Tim Willi - Wells Fargo", "Wanted to get your thoughts, if you could, around Bitcoin. Obviously, that\u2019s sort of the new rage. We get a lot of questions from investors. I\u2019m sure you do as well. But can you just talk about how you think about it, whether it is something that potentially could be a broad consumer application, or if it\u2019s more of a niche around cross-border business? Or just how how you might think about that, and how Visa might interact or support that, or not at all.", "Charlie Scharf ", "I guess I would start with, it\u2019s early days in terms of what Bitcoin is, and what it will be. We\u2019re certainly paying attention to it. It\u2019s very early to understand exactly what all of the implications are for it. ", "We will say, when we look at our network and the people that we compete with in terms of what people think of as a traditional network, the established network rules we have, the understanding of how things operate, understanding who the participants are, the fact that business that we do has financial institutions on either side of the transaction, you know, the success of our payment system and our primary competitors is that for a reason. ", "And there\u2019s certainly some interesting things about Bitcoin and other things like it, but there\u2019s also a great deal of complexity. People talk about things like frictionless and things like that, and when you actually dig through it, it\u2019s really not the case. It\u2019s far more complex than that. And we feel very comfortable with the business that we have here. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. ", "Bob Napoli - William Blair", "Question on security. And I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have all the answers on this, but if EMV had been in place, would it have prevented some of the recent breaches? And just in line with the trend in security, it seems like there are these dates out there that tend to get pushed back. Do you think that the breach at Target and others, do you sense it\u2019s going to drive the adoption of EMV and other security faster than it otherwise would have? Are you seeing action taking place that wasn\u2019t happening 30 days ago?", "Charlie Scharf ", "Well, the second part of your question, I think the answer is yes. You know, people don\u2019t live in a vacuum, and when you see the kinds of breaches that have occurred recently, it gets everyone focused on making sure that we\u2019re doing all that we can to minimize any potential fraud in the future. ", "So the dates that we had set out are the dates that we are going to stick with. Again, it requires people do a lot of work, which we understand, but we think it\u2019s good for the payment system, for the ultimate end user, which means it will ultimately be good for all of us, in the process.", "On your first piece, remember, first of all, in terms of what actually has happened with the breaches that we\u2019ve read about, not all the facts are out yet. So it\u2019s a little premature for all of us to talk about what would have solved it. ", "I think it\u2019s fair to say that as best we can tell, some of the breaches that you\u2019ve read about don\u2019t relate to the payment systems at all. They relate to breaches within companies\u2019 server environments, or some personal information, so EMV would obviously have nothing to do with that. ", "To the extent that there were breaches occurring on the point of sale device, it\u2019s probable that the account number possibly would have been able to be compromised, but the ability to reuse that account number to create a new card, to use that card at a physical point of sale on a fraudulent basis, would not be possible. It would still be possible to use that account number potentially at card not present, which is why it\u2019s important that the industry also continue to push forward with tokenization.", "Operator", "Tom McCrohan from Janney Capital Markets, you may ask your question.", "Tom McCrohan - Janney Capital Markets", "Is V.me being positioned as a mobile wallet long term? Or is it more kind of a tender type for ecommerce transactions, something more like a Paypal?", "Charlie Scharf ", "I think of V.me very simply as a way for our customers to have an easy way to make payments online with their general purpose credit card, through user name and password. So people like to ask is it a wallet? Is it this? Is it that? It\u2019s really not that complicated. It\u2019s when you are buying on your computer, your tablet, or on your mobile device, right now it\u2019s not easy to get from the beginning of the checkout process to the end of the checkout process using our products. ", "And V.me is just an easy way to check out using user name and password and not having to enter your account number, the expiration date, shipping address, and all that other kind of stuff. And whether it\u2019s something called V.me or it\u2019s with another solution, we\u2019re indifferent. We just want our cards to be able to help enable commerce in the digital world online.  ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan ", "I had a quick follow up on the breach, then I had a cross-border question. Just on the breach, any risk of indirect impact from consumer [confidence] changing maybe in terms of usage of card, maybe mix shift to credit, or just reissuance risk in general. And then on cross-border, I know there\u2019s a lot of discussion in the market around emerging markets, FX volatility. Can that have any impact on cross-border activity or profitability? What should we be considering there? And then lastly, cross border, on the World Cup front and with the Olympics, is that enough to show up in cross-border volumes?", "Charlie Scharf ", "Why don\u2019t I start with the first? Consumer confidence and using the cards, which we pay very close attention to, continues to still look very, very good. We\u2019ve actually done our own surveys, starting at the time of the breach. One of the reasons why we ran the advertising that we ran to make sure that consumers understand that, while it\u2019s unpleasant and not something that we want them to go through, they\u2019re actually protected. And in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in our actual payment results and these surveys, things continue to look pretty good for us.", "Byron Pollitt ", "On the cross-border front, logic would say that depending on how currencies move, it should have an impact on cross-border. The way it tends to materialize, and the way we typically think about it, is by corridor. ", "And yet what we saw this past quarter, despite a broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar, there was actually strong traffic to the United States and strong cross-border spend from countries where the currencies were somewhat weaker relative to the U.S. dollar. ", "And that\u2019s counterintuitive to what you would normally think. As a result, our view more broadly on cross-border is that it\u2019s economically driven, and that how economic growth globally behaves is more likely to have an impact on our overall cross-border volumes. ", "So if I were to single out an area, emerging markets, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on declining values and growth rates in emerging markets. Those areas still have been vibrant sources of growth for us, but we have a close watch on that in the year to come. ", "With regard to World Cup, Brazil has been one of those countries where the currency has weakened, which bodes well for incoming traffic to the World Cup this summer in Brazil. The outbound spend from Brazil is one that will be under pressure, for two reasons. One, the weakness of the currency. That\u2019s often overpowered by an unflagging desire for Brazilians to travel. The government\u2019s making it more difficult, however, by putting on some pretty serious taxes, both on the use of credit and debit cards when they\u2019re used in cross-border transactions. ", "So I\u2019d say from a World Cup standpoint, hopefully I would expect most of the Brazilians to stay home for the festivities and that outbound travel is probably never much in the cards. Inbound travel, if anything, should be aided by the weakness in the currency in Brazil and possibly Argentina will benefit as well, as their currency has taken a nosedive of late. ", "Charlie Scharf ", "Hard to believe we\u2019ll see anything Sochi.", "Byron Pollitt ", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question will be from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. ", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Just two quick questions. One, I guess, just what\u2019s behind the slowdown in U.S. debit volumes, and any difference between PIN and signature? And secondly, I noticed you guys hide EMV chip, just your latest thoughts on the EMV chip versus the EMV chip and PIN, and will you promote one versus the other?", "Byron Pollitt ", "On the debit side, I\u2019d say hard to read that. There is pretty tepid growth in personal disposable income, which is the primary indicator we look at, now that we\u2019ve pretty much lapped the more immediate Durbin effects. Remember, debit is disproportionately nondiscretionary. So one of the important drivers of debit spend is the growth in jobs, which adds to the overall growth in nondiscretionary and debit spend. And we\u2019re just not seeing much in the way of growth rates there. What we\u2019re seeing is declining growth rates there for the U.S. in that regard.", "If we were to take a look at Visa signature versus Interlink, I would say the growth rates on the PIN side have been running higher than on the signature side. And as you noticed, we downshifted a bit from where we were in the prior quarter as we began to move further away from the immediate effects of Durbin and begin to hit a more normalized pattern.", "Charlie Scharf ", "And just on the issue of signature versus PIN, as we move toward EMV, just remember, this is a country where people are used to signing with their credit card. Most cards don\u2019t even have a PIN attached to them. And I make reference to this in my remarks. We think it\u2019s very important that we move towards EMV, but it\u2019s equally important that we don\u2019t disturb the growth in commerce that does exist in this country. And to the extent that we can do things to make that transition as smooth as possible, that\u2019s extremely important. So we think there is a future for a meaningful period of time for signature.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays ", "We noticed that the service fees were up sequentially. Did anything in pricing or perhaps some lag effects from the [unintelligible] drive that? And then is there anything unsustainable around the amount you\u2019re now generating in service fees per dollar of payment volume? And then just quickly, on the topic of pricing, we clearly saw a pretty significant cross-border price change at Mastercard over the last couple of quarters. While I know you guys want to be careful and surgical on pricing changes, especially [unintelligible], might there be some similar opportunities soon from Visa? ", "Byron Pollitt ", "On the service fee side, I would say there\u2019s no real callout. Remember, a lot of our service fee is subject to FX impacts. So if we look at the constant dollar growth in service fees, we\u2019re at 13, the FX impact bringing that down to about 10 nominally. And service fee growth was around 9. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty close. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s no real callout on the yields. It\u2019s well within a zipcode of what we have done within the past three or four quarters. So no callouts. ", "Charlie Scharf ", "And on the pricing question, I answer it very consistently with what we\u2019ve been saying. We are not opposed to increase in price, we\u2019re not opposed to decrease in price, we\u2019re not opposed to keeping price the same, as long as there\u2019s a reason for all of those things. So I think we have been disciplined, we\u2019ve been thoughtful, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. And I guess the last thing I would say is we are more than willing to sacrifice our short term performance versus other people if it\u2019s the right long term thing to do for our company and for our industry. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve done and what we haven\u2019t done in pricing.", "Operator", "Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies, your line is open.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies ", "If I heard correctly, I think processed transaction growth slowed a little bit in the first three weeks of January, 11% versus the 13% last quarter. So wanted to get a little bit more color there in terms of kind of U.S. versus international trends. And then just quickly switching gears, any thoughts in terms of the implications of the data breaches on MCX\u2019s potential strategy? I know you guys get a lot of questions around that, but to the extent they were looking at private label or decoupled debit product as a primary funding source in their wallet now, with the potential for consumers to be more wary about giving their bank account data to a retailer. Would just appreciate any thoughts you have around that.", "Byron Pollitt ", "Let me start with the transaction growth. And let me break it down U.S. versus international, give it to you for the first quarter, and then for January, so that you have the detail. So as I said on the call, processed transaction growth for the first quarter was 13%, U.S. was 9%, and international was 26%. January, 21 days, processed transaction growth was 11. 7 for the U.S., 24 for international. So a downtick in both. ", "Charlie Scharf ", "And I guess just to add a touch of color on that, because we obviously look at these numbers daily, weekly. We look at all the trends. And the one thing that we talk about over the past several months, and it really goes back to the beginning of last quarter, is there\u2019s a lot of volatility embedded in the numbers. Week in, week out, it\u2019s very hard to pick up trends. And so whether they\u2019re positive or negative over a several week period of time, we\u2019ve been unable to discern anything more meaningful than this continued tepid recovery that Byron described.", "And then on the second question, I guess I would say what we continue to say. And I\u2019ve talked about this fairly consistently. As we think about our competitive position, understanding that we\u2019re continuing to evolve and change and make sure that we open our network up to those who can direct transactions to us and continue to build value on our network. ", "Having said all that, safety, security, and soundness is the price of entry in payments. There\u2019s no question about that. And people can build whatever they want, and the moment that consumers start to get nervous about using their own personal information or payment credentials is the moment that people will start to see the effect of that. ", "And so what we and our primary competitors have are these established payment networks, known rules, people understand how they\u2019re protected, which is why we think EMV is important, because it takes mag stripe to a new standard, and we\u2019re pushing beyond EMV towards the next thing. And so to the extent that other payment methods are not as secure, that is a competitive disadvantage. And that\u2019s how we think about it. ", "Operator", "Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW, please ask your question.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW ", "Just had a question on the FX hedging practices going forward. How should we think about the relevance of them as currencies move going forward, especially if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen more?", "Byron Pollitt ", "According to the [forwards], the U.S. dollar is strengthening more against the currencies that are most relevant in our portfolio. So the forwards aren\u2019t as steep as what we were looking at a year ago, but nonetheless, to the extent there has been a headwind, I would say looking forward, the headwind continues. It\u2019s just not as steep as it was when we looked out six, nine months ago.", "We begin hedging a year ahead of time. So we hedge 12 months out. We do rolling hedges. So we begin 12 months out, and then our hedges are largely in place, I would say, five or six months before the period we actually report. We do economic hedges, so we don\u2019t hedge everything. For a particular currency, we take revenue, subtract the natural hedge of the expenses we incur in that currency, and then we hedge not 100%, but a meaningful portion of the remainder, and we do that for about 15 currencies. ", "The intent is not to speculate, but to simply dampen the impact of currencies. And the way we approach it, it\u2019s not possible to put complete hedges in place. The intent is to put enough in to dampen it within certain predetermined exposures that we calculate. It\u2019s a pretty straightforward value at risk analysis.", "So when there are large sustained movements, those are going to be reflected in our numbers. They just won\u2019t have the amplitude that you would have if we didn\u2019t hedge. We have pretty good visibility to this, which is why we can give you a three to four quarter look ahead, which is our practice from a guidance standpoint.", "Operator", "Craig Maurer with CLSA, your line is open. ", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "First is for Byron. If you could discuss the cadence in marketing spend. Will the ramp look similar to what we saw during the last Olympic Games? Though I do know you have two events coming up. And secondly, does [host card] emulation present a good tool for your tokenization project in the card not present world? And would you move quickly toward certification there?", "Charlie Scharf ", "Let me just do number two first, because the answer is yes.", "Byron Pollitt ", "And on the second one, I don\u2019t have a comparison, but you should expect a significant increase in marketing spend in Q2 and Q3, and then a meaningful downshift in Q4. We\u2019ve had this combination before, and even though the finals of the World Cup are typically in July, which is Q4, there is a substantial amount of marketing that occurs prior to the finals in that April, May, June timeframe. So that quarter has a substantial component of the World Cup, and this quarter is the one that has virtually all of the Winter Olympics spend. One other callout, the spend for Winter Olympics is significant in terms of the quarterly cadence, but it is not at the level of spend that you would see for a Summer Olympics. ", "Charlie Scharf ", "Let me just reiterate what Byron said in his opening remarks, just to make sure that we were as clear as we can be. As we look to our fiscal second and third quarters, in the second and third quarters, because of what Byron referred to, our revenue growth numbers will not be as robust as we\u2019ve seen this quarter and in the fourth quarter. ", "We said that we expect the expense growth to be higher in the second and third quarters because of the marketing numbers that Byron talked about. And that obviously then flows through to weaker margins in the second and third quarters, recovering in the fourth quarter for things that we know are coming, which is why we reaffirmed full year guidance. But there will be these variable and lumpy trends as we see the year play itself out. ", "Operator", "Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may ask your question. ", "Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "My question is relatively simple. It may not be quite as simple of an answer, but I\u2019m hoping to get a little bit of perspective around the processed transactions. Just in terms of the percentage that has basically been migrating slowly higher, I was hoping you might be able to dimensionalize what is driving that share increase in terms of processed transactions, what are the contributors to that, and maybe what you think is a reasonable high end for processed transactions.", "And then separately, if you would provide any color around the merchant relationships that you mentioned in your opening remarks, in terms of improving those relationships and what that might entail.", "Byron Pollitt ", "I think that\u2019s a pretty straightforward, simple question, on the processed transactions part, for sure. Two dimensions here. First of all, when you look at the relative growth rates between U.S. and international, the international is growing at a multiple of the U.S. growth rate. When you break down international, if you took a snapshot of our portfolio today, international for us is still largely a credit business. That\u2019s what got established first.", "When you look at what\u2019s driving the transaction growth, it is very clearly debit and that is the huge opportunity that will drive international transaction growth for years to come. For us, debit is still in its infancy internationally relative to the United States.", "Another dimension: in the United States, we process nearly 100% of our transactions. Outside of the United States, we can process anywhere from 90% to 0%. And so the opportunity for us to Visa process transactions is still a wide open field. And that, by the way, is particularly true in debit. So you will hear us talk a lot more about that in the quarters to come, because it\u2019s linked so directly to our growth opportunity.", "Charlie Scharf ", "And on the merchant question, we don\u2019t have anything that we want to talk publicly about now with any individual merchant, but as I said in the opening remarks, our goal is to provide the kinds of value-added services for merchants that we have done such a good job of providing to the issuing community for a long period of time. And we\u2019re in the process of having discussions, and when we have specifics to talk about, we\u2019ll talk about them.", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] And the next one will come from Smitti Srethapramote, Morgan Stanley. ", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Can you please give us an update on your government relations efforts in emerging markets to increase the electronification of payments?", "Charlie Scharf ", "First of all, government relations for us, especially when you get outside of the developed world, is not a traditional government relations function. It\u2019s not a staff function that sits to the side and just goes around and has lobbying types of conversations. In the emerging markets, government relations is a business for us, because the government is our partner in helping electronify the payment systems in these particular markets.", "Very often, when the government leads with trying to move their transactions to the electronic payment systems, that then can help drive the market. That\u2019s what we see in places like Rwanda and other places, which are really emerging.", "And so when you look across the world, we think of the government as a client and a partner to helping build a business which is good for them. And the reason why it\u2019s good for them is it\u2019s ultimately good for all of their participants, whether it\u2019s the merchants or the individuals, and obviously we and our competitors will benefit from that, as cash exits society.", "Byron Pollitt ", "If I were to reflect back to when we went public in 2008, and if you were to have asked that question, I don\u2019t think anyone would have thought to ask that question. But today, governments of emerging markets have gotten a lot more interested and pay a lot more attention to electronic forms of payment. They\u2019re interested in it from a very self-serving standpoint in that you can\u2019t tax what you can\u2019t see, but they\u2019re also very focused on this is a way of providing, in Charlie\u2019s words, a safer, more secure and sound financial system for their citizens. ", "And so there\u2019s a natural tendency to want to regulate, and our involvement now is very, very early contact with a broad range of emerging market governments, because they can be very well intentioned but also unenlightened in regard to how to think about regulation, and what the impacts are. ", "And so we have got government relations people stationed all over the world, particularly in emerging markets, and their role is largely educational, so that governments that have a legitimate interest in regulating this part of their monetary system can do so understanding how best to provide safety, security, and soundness and to allow the market to operate so that they get the kind of penetration of electronic payments, which will grow and be healthy. ", "And we\u2019ve been exceptionally pleased with the reception of most governments to talking with us and partnering with us to develop their electronic payment systems in a way that\u2019s healthy and I think will provide a good foundation for growth to come. ", "Operator", "Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer, you may ask your question.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer ", "As you renewed your Chase deal, I think the implication, or you suggested that you\u2019d pick up some incremental volume. I was curious if you\u2019ve started to see that, and should we be thinking about that as sort of being reflected in the run rate or something that we could expect going forward throughout calendar \u201914 as sort of incremental volume? And then just a quick number question, in terms of where are you in terms of V.me merchants signed.", "Byron Pollitt ", "On Chase, we do expect to see incremental volume during the course of the year. We expect some to begin this quarter, not material, and we expect it to build through the course of fiscal year \u201914. In our guidance, that incremental is contemplated, but it will be more second half weighted, clearly, than first half.", "Charlie Scharf ", "And on V.me merchants, I don\u2019t have the updated number here, to be honest with you. ", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer ", "Do we sort of get a step function increase at some point during this year, or is it sort of gradual, test mode, kind of figuring it out?", "Charlie Scharf ", "We\u2019ll be in a position to answer that question in another month or two, because we\u2019ve just rolled out the new platform that I described. And we\u2019ll start to see the effect of it, and have a better understanding of what it means for the ramp up.", "Operator", "Next we have Chris Brendler of Stifel.", "Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus ", "I have two questions that I probably won\u2019t get a lot of detail on, so hopefully it won\u2019t take too long. One is Visa Europe, anything you can say additionally about Visa Europe and what potentially that would look like if it could come back to you? Any progress there? Any updates? ", "And then similarly, on the Judge Leon case and the appeal, obviously you can\u2019t give us too much there, but I was wondering if there was any way you could, on a timeline, it sounded like from that hearing that the timeline could be shorter than I think the original estimates that were somewhere around a year. Is it possible we could hear something from the three judge appeal panel in the next couple of months? ", "Charlie Scharf ", "Nothing different to talk about on Visa Europe. Otherwise, I would have mentioned it in my opening remarks. And on timing, we don\u2019t know, on the appeal.", "Jack Carsky ", "And in terms of the last question, we\u2019ve got the numbers. We have over 300 signed, and 80 are currently live, on the V.me.", "Operator", "Next we have a question from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous.", "Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research ", "Byron, just wanted to peel back your comments on emerging markets a little bit more. Can you give us a rough sense of what percent of your volumes come from emerging markets? And then within that volume category, can you give us a range of what type of multiple to your overall volume growth that this is growing? Is it three times as fast, or four times?", "Byron Pollitt ", "I don\u2019t actually have those statistics at my command. The emerging markets, these growth rates are midteens and better. ", "Charlie Scharf ", "And depending on the market, it could be substantially better than that.", "Byron Pollitt ", "Yes, and could be substantially better. And these growth rates, we have a portfolio. So even though some of these have had currency issues in terms of weakening currencies, these growth rates have held pretty well even where there has been weaker currencies. Government intervention, where they\u2019re trying to limit the outbound, can have an effect. You\u2019re seeing that in Brazil today. Likely to see it in Argentina, Venezuela, countries where there have been more severe locations. But the durability of the growing cross-border in emerging markets has been quite resilient.", "Operator", "Your last question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ", "Quick question on the cybersource transaction growth, which decelerated in the first fiscal quarter. Any commentary just broadly around that, and implications or read throughs to overall ecommerce volume?", "Byron Pollitt ", "Let me separate the two. On ecommerce volume, this was a fantastic holiday spend season for ecommerce. And the trend in growth and ecom is very, very healthy. And so the downshift a bit in the growth in cybersource has nothing to do with the underlying growth in ecommerce.", "What I would say the cybersource established an early significant position as a gateway in what has become a much more competitive space. And I think what we\u2019re going to find in the next few quarters is that we\u2019re going to need to up our game and that this space is just going to be more competitively intense than it has been in the past couple of years. And that is a direct testament to how attractive the growth prospects are for ecom, which is the one channel that is particularly suited for electronic payments.", "Jack Carsky ", "And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us this morning.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our Web site prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, turning to revenue, as expected and previewed on our call last quarter revenue growth moderated during the quarter, growing 9% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 7% nominally, which includes the expected 2 percentage points of FX headwind we had been guiding to since the beginning of the fiscal year. As a reminder the current Q2 is lapping 15% revenue growth in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a number of favorable one-time adjustments.", "Looking ahead to Q3, we expect nominal revenue growth to be in mid single-digits which could be a couple of percentage points below Q2\u2019s growth rate. As signaled on last quarter\u2019s call, a softer Q3 growth rate was also anticipated given continued FX headwinds of 2 percentage points, a 17% revenue comp in the prior year quarter, also driven impart by one-time events and a moderation in cross-border spend which we view as short-term. After two softer quarters in fiscal Q4, we expect to see constant dollar revenue growth more reflective of the secular shift as well as the e-commerce and mobile trends that have driven and will continue to drive attractive growth for years to come.", "As a footnote to fiscal Q4, we expect very little impact from Chase card conversions, particularly given our quarter lag and reporting of service fees. This event will have more impact in fiscal year 2015.", "Our guidance for client incentives remains unchanged, despite delivering first half client incentives as a percent of gross revenues of 15.8%, we expect incentives to be second half weighted and finish the year within the current guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%. On a full fiscal year basis, we now expect our guidance of low double-digit constant dollar net revenue growth to be in the 10% to 11% range with a negative 2 percentage point impact from FX.", "Now let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. On a constant dollar basis global payment volume growth was 12% unchanged from Q1. U.S. payment volume growth for Q2 was 8%, also unchanged from Q1. With a boost from Easter timing and better weather U.S. payment volume growth for the first 21 days of April rose to 12%. The deceleration in cross-border growth seems to be bubbling out. Q2 constant dollar growth was 8%, 4 percentage points down from Q1, but the first 21 days of April registered 7% growth nearly flat to Q2. Cross-border weakness is pronounced in Latin America, as in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, the Canada to U.S. corridor and Russia.", "Visa process transaction growth was a healthy 11% in Q2 and rose to 14% for the first 21 days in April. Taken together we are seeing a sustained economic recovery, but no signs yet of acceleration. A word on Russia and Ukraine, we have clearly seen a drop-off in cross-border volume and sanctions are expected to have some impact on volume. Our guidance assumes several pennies of EPS impact for the fiscal year. We are fully engaged with all parties involved and we\u2019ll continue to adjust our outlook as the situation clarifies overtime.", "Next callout relates to our effective tax rate for the period. At 22% for the quarter, our rate was positively influenced by the recognition of tax benefits under IRS Section 199 which allows for the deduction of a portion of the income related to U.S. domestically produced computer software. As a reminder, successfully employing strategies to manage our tax rate lower has been a consistent component of our earnings guidance since we went public in 2008 and will continue to be in the future.", "The total benefit to the quarter was $218 million, $184 million of which represented prior years and $17 million of benefit for each of the first two fiscal quarters. We expect an additional 30 million to 35 million of benefit over the remaining two fiscal quarters and a continuing benefit in future years. Accordingly, we are adding to our guidance for fiscal 2014 a full year tax rate approaching 30%. Please note, this rate was contemplated in our full year EPS guidance for fiscal 2014.", "Last callout, we remain bullish on our future growth prospects and fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 5.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $217 and change resulting in the total cost of 1.1 billion. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of 3 billion at the end of March, and as always we will take advantage of market movements to effectively repurchase at attractive rates.", "Now let me dive a little deeper into the numbers. As noted earlier global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 12%, the U.S. grew 8% and international grew 16%. Drilling down further for the March quarter, U.S. credit growth was 11%, slightly higher than the 10% in Q1. Through April 21st credit improved to 14% growth, U.S. debit was 7% in Q2, flat compared to Q1 and through April 21st debit also improved, rising to 11% growth. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter, down from 12% in the December quarter.", "The U.S. grew 7% and international grew 8%. Through April 21st cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with the U.S. growing 8% and international registering 7% growth. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 15.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period, the U.S. grew 7% while international delivered 23% growth. Through April 21st, processed transaction growth rose to 14%.", "Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2 percentage point foreign currency headwind.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.5 billion, up 7% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. The difference between the 7% reported revenue growth and the 12% growth in constant dollar payment volume is largely due to 3 percentage points of negative FX. Visa service fees are disproportionately impacted by foreign exchange translation, compared to other revenue lines.", "Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 7% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa process transaction both in the U.S. and internationally. The difference between 7% revenue growth and 11% transaction growth in the period was due to one-time SAMs accrual reversals in the prior year in combination with the influence of the fixed fee component associated with the SAMs pricing structure that does not grow with transactions. International transaction revenue was up 5% to $871 million reflecting some moderation of growth across the globe that first impacted us at the outset of calendar year 2014.", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Certain expenses have been rephrased to the Q3 and Q4 fiscal quarters and as signaled last quarter, we continue to expect elevated marketing investments in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q1 tied to the 2014 FIFA World Cup event. Operating margin, 65% for the second quarter, ahead of our annual guidance of low 60s, but consistent with our expectations for higher expenses in the fiscal third and fourth quarters.", "That said we now expect our full year operating margin to be in the low to mid 60s. Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had 629 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 634 million.", "Finally, given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, let me recap our full year guidance. Constant dollar net revenue growth 10% to 11% with 2 percentage points of negative FX impact; client incentives in the 16.5 to 17.6 range; operating margin in the low to mid 60s; tax rate approaching 30%; EPS growth of mid to high-teens; free cash flow of about 5 billion.", "And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charlie Scharf", "Thanks a lot Byron and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a couple of comments about the quarter and reiterate some of the things that Byron had said. First of all and probably most importantly to us as we look at our results underlying what we see the business drivers from the most part remains steady from last quarter. Specifically the U.S. spending levels grew consistent with that of the prior quarter, not accelerating or decelerating but still reasonably strong and as Byron had mentioned April is off to a strong start which is certainly encouraging for us.", "Non-U.S. domestic spending grew consistent levels as well and non-U.S. cross-border spending was weaker and as Byron mentioned, it\u2019s from very specific corridors which we can certainly talk more about. Revenue growth came in where we expected and as we mentioned it was impacted by the strong U.S. dollar and these non-recurring comps from the prior year, and we expect these effects to be slightly more pronounced in the third quarter. And looking even beyond the third quarter, we would expect in the fourth quarter to see revenue growth more reflective of the strong payment volumes that continue to underpin our quarterly results.", "Let me move now for a second and just describe what we see in Russia. As I\u2019m sure you all know the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions a few weeks ago which has forced us to take action. We\u2019re complying with U.S. law as you would expect which means that two affected banks cannot issue or acquire transactions for Visa. These banks represent less than 1% of our volume in Russia and you would expect that we would continue to comply with U.S. law as sanctioned situation evolves. As of now all of the Visa systems are processing normally and we continue to serve all of our other clients in Russia today. Due to U.S. sanctions the Russian Duma is working on modifications to the current national payment system law, President Putin has directed the Duma to pass a series of changes which could pass as early as tomorrow. The proposed modifications are evolving, but as we understand them could include the following; first of all, all domestic data processing would need to be onshore; second, most domestic transactions data would need to remain domiciled within Russia; third, a payment network must provide continuity of services in compliance with Russian law; fourth, the creation of a settlement center 100% owned by the Central Bank of Russia; fifth, a collateral requirement for foreign payment systems; and lastly, the ability to impose volumes on foreign payment system providers.", "Keep in mind, this is all still fluid and while none of this is certainly helpful for Visa if passed, parts might even cause us to rethink our domestic processing opportunity in Russia. But we are hopeful that there is still opportunity for Visa to participate in the growing in the electronic payments business in Russia. We will not understand the impact on our business in potential future until the laws and regulations are completed. But we remain committed to finding ways to provide our services as long as U.S. government and Russian governments allow.", "On the legal and regulatory front, not a lot to talk about this quarter as I\u2019m sure you know in late March the U.S. Court have appealed for the DC Court rule but the Federal reserve acted properly in its interpretation of Dodd-Frank a result which we are obviously pleased with.", "A quick update on payment security and specifically industry collaboration, last quarter I spoke at length about the need for the industry defined broadly to work together to create payment standards and improve security. We believe there is an opportunity for this collaboration to occur and are encouraged. We and MasterCard have formed a cross-industry working group to accelerate this joint-collaboration. The purpose is to work with a broad group of participants in the payments landscape, not just to move forward to more secure technologies in the short-term, but to think in long-term as well. This includes driving EMV adoption, but it looks to create a clear roadmap for the future of payment security, inclusive of both physical, POS as well as card-not-present transactions.", "The group will have representation of banks of all sizes, credit unions, acquirers, retailers, point of sale manufacturers and industry trade groups. We also look forward to broad network participation so we can be as effective as possible. On EMV specifically First Data Star Network, FIS\u2019s NYCE Network, Discovery Financial Services PULSE Network, and other regional network providers have agreed to participate in the common debit solution that these introduced last year. The collaboration between Visa and our partners will help enable the deployment of debit EMV solutions. This is again an example of industry players working together to move payment security forward.", "Let me talk for a second about tokenization. The standards, services and technologies we\u2019re working on will play an important role, not just in security but in enabling and securing new payment experiences in the online mobile and face-to-face channels. We are making progress on our work towards getting it into the marketplace. The token standard that we, MasterCard and American Express jointly wrote and sponsored has been adopted by EMVCo, the industry standards body, and is currently at a common period across the other card networks, banks and security industry groups.", "We will be rolling out our token services capable of associating a limited use of Visa token with an underlying card credential and are working with issuers, processors, and acquirers that introduced our first wave of token programs. You will see applications deployed within the next 12 months and these tokens will play a role in our offerings but also those of select strategic partner engagements ranging from remote online or mobile purchases to proximity mobile interactions.", "We have also talked a great deal about our merchant efforts. We recently reorganized the Company to strengthen the outreach to our merchant partners. We are lucky to have hired Ram\u00f3n Martin, a well-respected industry expert in payments with a great deal of merchant knowledge. As an example, he has a history as the member of the Board of Directors of the National Retail Federation. We are excited that he will lead our efforts relative to our merchant strategy, and help deliver customized products and services, and look forward to discussing more specifics in the future.", "Let me now just turn for a second and just talk about small business merchants. We have had made changes to our FANF structure, our fixed acquirer network fee, including modifications that are designed to lower or in some cases eliminate FANF, on volume from small merchants with less than $15,000 in annual gross Visa sales. Most importantly, we believe these changes can serve to expand the Visa acceptance among very small businesses, while eliminating the fees for smaller retailers we\u2019re also making other adjustments to FANF to improve the alignment of these fees, regardless of whether a merchant connects to Visa through an acquirer, a processor, a payment facilitator, or other party.", "We have also talked on these calls about rules in the past and our efforts to simplify our operating regulations. On October 1st we will be eliminating close to half of our operating rules. This includes reducing the complexity of our dispute resolution processes, and while we are making substantial changes now we continue to get client feedback and we will continue to introduce more changes beyond.", "Let me talk for a second about Japan. I have spoken about two things here in the past, both the opportunity within Japan but also the importance of growing our processing business globally. Just a reminder, that although Japan is the third largest economy in the world by GDP, the number of payment cards in the market and usage is still very low, only 14% of PCE and just 8% on Visa products. Earlier this month we acquired 100% ownership of GP Net, a joint-venture that we have founded with seven leading Japanese issuers back in 1995, as a result of having total control, we now control our domestic transaction processing activities. It will allow us to further integrate our processing and product solutions to merchants, acquirers and issuers something that we are very excited about.", "We are also very focused on the debit opportunity in Japan. While debit is still considered in its infancy stage, there is a meaningful opportunity for growth given the large deposit base which exists in the banks from which to grow a debit business. As an example, this quarter we launched Visa Debit with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, one of the three mega banks, again just one example of how we\u2019re working collaboratively with the banks to target a very meaningful opportunity.", "So to conclude, let me just make a couple of comments looking ahead. First of all I continue to remain very excited about the opportunity that we have to continue growing the business. While the strengthening U.S. dollar and difficult comps from the prior year have affected our reported revenue and will again next quarter, the underlying revenue growth of the business is strong. It will accelerate as the economic recovery accelerates as well, and most importantly the long-term secular trends and our competitive position remain as strong as ever and I\u2019m constantly reminded that there\u2019s more cash to dis-intermediate than when the Company went public in 2008.", "And with that Byron and I are glad to take your question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sir, your line is open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thank you. I guess I just wanted some more context or on some of the comments Byron had about the volumes. Byron you talked about cross-border weakness being temporary and seeing some firmness in the decline. Could you just talk about what gives you comfort that we could rebound from here or at least flatten out? And then second, you guys talked about sustained economic growth and not accelerating growth, is that simply just by observing the absolute volume statistics or there something else you\u2019re seeing underneath the covers that lead you to believe it\u2019s more sustained versus accelerating? Thank you.", "Byron Pollitt", "So, let me start with cross-border, we haven\u2019t seen single-digit cross-border growth rate since I would say 2009, that was five years ago and given the underlying secular trends in our business none of those are diminished, none of those are going away. As Charlie said, there\u2019s more cash to dis-intermediate today, note, outside the U.S. in particular, then it was when we went public, so from our standpoint, we look at cross-border, the fundamentals are still in place, it recovered nicely from 2009, so we expect to see the same, hard to predict when, and it may be a little early to call, given the April results, but by -- given the 4 percentage point drop we saw between the two quarters and given the fundamentals underpinning this secular shift, our view is we could be reaching a bottoming out, and in any event looking forward we would expect this to move north.", "In terms of the broader economic question of sustained recovery, this is very much anchored in the volume trends we\u2019re seeing, recognizing that there is modest but if not weak job creation in the U.S., at some point that will begin to accelerate but we are adding jobs, so the underlying fundamentals that should inform and drive spend are in place, they\u2019re just in first gear, and so that\u2019s our take on the environment. Charlie, would you like to add?", "Charlie Scharf", "The only thing that I\u2019m going to add, back to the first part of the question on cross-border, as Byron and I both pointed out, the corridors that we\u2019re seeing the weakness are very-very specific places, so for instance when you look at U.S. cardholders traveling abroad, that volume, those growth rates are actually flat quarter-to-quarter, which is obviously a good sign for the core U.S. and the health of the U.S. consumer, again in very-very specific places and not at all across every single geography which would give us more cause for concern.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question...", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Could I ask one more follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind? Embedded in your guidance is what assumption around cross-border growth for the rest of the year?", "Byron Pollitt", "No acceleration.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase", "Great. Thanks. Just to clarify is the revenue revision at the high-end of the revenue outlook is that really just explained by cross-border or is there something? Just wanted to clarify. And then just maybe on the Russia front, did you disclose how much it represents in terms of revenue, today and I\u2019m curious as a bigger picture question, sorry to build on this but, maybe Charlie, does this Russia situation sort of build this case that maybe countries are going to consider creating their own domestic schemes like the ones that Putin\u2019s talking about? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "I\u2019ll tell you what Tien-tsin, could you re-ask your first question, I didn\u2019t actually understand it.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase ", "Yes, I\u2019m rambling a little bit Byron, just the first question in a simple way, is the revenue revision in terms of your outlook, I think you said it was 10 to 13 before, and now we\u2019re looking at 10 to 11, if I heard that correctly. It\u2019s the difference there just across the border or is there something else?", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes we would -- it\u2019s heavily driven by cross-border. We would also add that U.S. debit down shifted more than we had anticipated when we constructed the original range. And so those are the -- I would say those are the two primary.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase", "Understood. And then on the Russian stuff?", "Byron Pollitt", "On the Russia, let me answer the first part of the question, which is the revenue part and then I\u2019ll turn it back over to Charlie for the second part. When we said that there were several pennies of impact, you may attribute 100% of that to revenue, and we didn\u2019t put any expense offset against that, so it would be the revenue equivalent in this fiscal year, and heavily weighted, 90% weighted to fiscal Q\u2019s 3 and 4.", "Charlie Scharf", "And the only thing I would just, on that point, and then going to your last point Tien-tsin is, remember, we don\u2019t know exactly, what our position will be in the marketplace. So the issues that exist really today relate to domestic processing within Russia. We still think by the way that there is meaningful reasons why the Russian government should want ourselves and the other established networks to participate there. And so we\u2019re not assuming that it\u2019s in the best interest of them for us not want to be there. And away from the domestic business there\u2019s obviously a very big part of our opportunity there is cross-border, which as you know is extremely hard to build a cross-border brand and processing assets in a short period of time. So again we really are still trying to understand ourselves exactly how this could play itself out. But still are hopeful that we still have a meaningful opportunity to continue to participate in the growing electronic payments business in Russia.", "And then we are broadly, kind of your last part of question on national payment systems, certainly the activities within Russia get people thinking about what it means for them. I\u2019m not sure how many parts of the world are actually contemplating the types of activities that Russia has taken upon themselves to bring about the sanctions which certainly should factor into people\u2019s minds. But as you know there are national payment schemes in different parts of the world that we compete with. And you know we firmly believe that what we have to offer goes well beyond what a national payment scheme can offer in terms of the capabilities of our network, our global acceptance, our ability to be accepted across all channels, fraud screening, I mean we can go on and on with the list. And so we are used to competing, and as long as there is the opportunity to compete, then we feel okay about the prospects. But certainly it\u2019s an issue.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase", "Excellent, thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "", "Next question.", "", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Yes hi guys just a couple of questions. One, just the down shift in U.S. debit and then obviously the lower cross-border volume, is any of that impacted by a share shift or share loss, or do you think that\u2019s all economically driven? And then secondly just a clarification on Russia, is the a couple of pennies, that you\u2019re talking about in earnings hit, is that 100% of Russia going away, or is that just the piece you think is going away due to the written proposal of the legislation that Charlie highlighted? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "On U.S. debit, it is, and we expect it to continue to be a pretty competitive space without full access to all the other debit spend just yet hard to know whether there is any shift going on. But we think that there has been a down shift in debit spend. We saw some of it occur right after the target breach, and so this is one where -- we\u2019ll just have to see it play out where we are encouraged by the spike post to Easter. So I think we will stay with this question over the next couple of quarters and get better informed.", "Cross-border, we don\u2019t think so, in terms of share shift. When you revert back to very specific corridors, very specific countries that have regulatory and tax events namely in Brazil and Argentina, manipulation of exchange rates by the Venezuelan government, those things are going to impact everybody. And so we don\u2019t think there is a sense of share shift there. This is just something much more fundamental to cross-border travel, and it should impact all.", "With regards to Russia a portion of the down shift in revenue growth is very clearly cross-border. In the quarter leading up to the Crimea crisis we began to see a down shift in Russian travel. But it was a modest deceleration. It then dropped quite a bit further after the Crimea crisis unfolded. This is a level of travel that this country generates a level of cross-border travel that if things quote return back to normal whatever that is in the future, we could easily see a rebound in Russia, Russian cross-border. We have got some place holders in for sanction effects that could be ongoing but honestly as Charlie said it\u2019s way too early to call this the situation is very much fluid at the moment and we\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress. Charlie do you want to add?", "Charlie Scharf", "No I think that\u2019s fine.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question I appreciate all the color on a confusing situation like Russia, but Charlie turning to a issuer that you know very well during the quarter Chase gave a little more color on what they\u2019re doing with ChaseNET so now given the largest wallet initiative out there among the large issuers so just thinking about it this initiative takes hold in other and successful for them and other large issuers start considering the same strategy what you think it means for your efforts with V.me and I\u2019m sure this issue comes in your discussions with large issuers. Can you shed some light on how they reconcile the thoughts between their own initiatives on wallets and V.me? Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "Sure. Listen I can\u2019t speak for every issuer or certainly I cannot speak for Chase as well what I can tell you from our point of view is we are fairly agnostic as to whether it\u2019s our wallet or someone else\u2019s wallet as long as our cards are appropriately represented on a fair level playing field. And in the case of Chase whether it\u2019s our cards or whether it runs over VisaNet or their version of VisaNet again we view those as our transactions. So to the extent that other issuers choose to want to go build their own wallets we\u2019ll be supportive of that but that doesn\u2019t stop us from continuing to build our wallet capabilities which I don\u2019t like to use the word wallet I like to use the word digital acceptance as a way to think about what we\u2019re trying to build. So that every bank out there and to serve its customers properly in digital commerce with digital acceptance. So hope that answers your question.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. So just quickly I thought I heard you say Charlie that there you\u2019re dropping as of October 1st you\u2019re eliminating say 50% of your operating rules is that?", "Charlie Scharf", "That\u2019s correct.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And so what I was trying to get at I guess in that question is what is it that I guess you\u2019re hoping to achieve by simplifying that I know it\u2019s a big part of your strategy that you\u2019ve highlighted in the past but I\u2019m wondering is that hope that it\u2019s going to come with incremental volumes and the retailers are looking to this and you\u2019ve also adjusted the stamp fee for small merchants so I\u2019m just trying to understand from a bigger perspective what is it that you\u2019re hoping to gain by changing half of your operating rules that\u2019s a pretty significant change?", "Charlie Scharf", "Shortlist and I think all of these things that you pointed out in addition to the operating regs go towards the point of I think most people would tell you whether you\u2019re an issue or merchant or in an acquirer people would say that historically that we were probably pretty difficult to deal with and we operate in a very competitive world today people have choices both established choices and have the opportunity to think of other ways to process payments and we want people to enjoy doing business with us and to think that we treat them openly, fairly and clearly and our operating regs which I\u2019ve got the version and they\u2019re sitting on my desk it\u2019s actually 1,538 pages pre our changes.", "Okay. And so imagine trying to be -- you are an issuer or an acquirer and you\u2019ve got to live by those and so simplification redundancy helping people understand what it means to do business with us as well as going out and what we\u2019ve been doing is asking again issuers, acquires, merchants what don\u2019t you like in that, what doesn\u2019t makes sense and a big part of the feedback that we received was on charge backs and the processes that we have put in place, the reporting requirements documentation and things like that. So we\u2019re very committed to continuing to support the integrity of our brand, the integrity of the payment system security and things that go towards the quality of our network but we have to be the kind of place that people say I understand the rules, I understand what it means to do business with you and you don\u2019t have a bunch of things buried on page 1,427 that they didn\u2019t understand. That in combination with these other things again I think just as if I was on the other side trying to figure out who I would want to do business with is the way I\u2019s wanted to be treated and that\u2019s way we\u2019re approaching it.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it, thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from James Friedman of SIG. Your line is open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group/SIG", "Hi. I wanted to ask you about NACHA and the prospects for acceleration in ACH, either Charlie or Byron, if you could help us think about the competitive dynamics in the instance that ACH were to be accelerated how if at all might it impact your business?", "Charlie Scharf", "Sure I guess I can start with this, which is we, our -- the differences between what the established payment networks have and what ACH\u2019s the differences are huge. It\u2019s not just the frequency of settlement it\u2019s the underlying ease of use of the ability to integrate within your systems it\u2019s the data that we have collected and then enable both issuers, acquirers and merchants to use it in the way which is good for risk purposes scorings that we\u2019ve developed and we have a whole series of capabilities that again that we\u2019ve all developed over 10, 20, 30, 40 years that really is not easily replicable.", "Our view is that certainly the issuers understand the benefits of working with that in this ecosystem they control the customer relationships and so we\u2019re very confident in that position that we have and the ability to differentiate our services versus what ACH can do. And I think if you look at some of the big players that use ACH and actually track through ACH and see well how does that actually impact the customer experience? It\u2019s a terrible experience for the customer as opposed to a network like ours. And in the environment that we live in today and the way banks are viewing the importance of their customer relationships it\u2019s just another differentiator that we had. So we love the position that we have relative to ACH.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group/SIG", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Don Fandetti - Citigroup", "Yes Byron just given the slowdown in cross-border I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your relative revenue yield my understanding is in the U.S. the yield is pretty high compared to domestic I mean is there a difference between let\u2019s say [indiscernible] and Asia can you talk a little bit about that?", "Byron Pollitt", "There are differences and there are different practices with regards to yields across the globe. We typically don\u2019t get into that level of detail to be a little helpful in this arena to the extent that there is a strong growth by U.S. cardholders that it\u2019s a strong consistent yield from an area of the world that is particularly well positioned to grow cross-border because of the strength of the U.S. dollar. You\u2019ll note that when we referenced the cross-border weakness before we called out a specific corridor it was Canada to the U.S. the U.S. to Canada corridor is doing just fine and as Charlie said the outbound travel by U.S. cardholders has remained quite strong and so I will leave the color at that.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research", "Yes. Thanks. I was wondering could you just give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource there is a little bit of a deceleration in volume growth in V.me filings too?", "Byron Pollitt", "Okay, I\u2019ll take the CyberSource, so there has been some deceleration in the growth of CyberSource we contribute that specifically to two large customers or clients that we lost in fiscal year \u201913 and we\u2019re starting to see the impacts of that in \u201914 that said we are very bullish on CyberSource we recognize the issue, we are investing significant sums to upgrade and add to the features of our CyberSource platform both for large enterprise businesses as well as for small businesses, we are actively adding people to this business. So our enthusiasm remains robust I will caution that it will take several quarters before we can get this turned around but remain very bullish and very confident on the outlook of CyberSource\u2019s future with Visa.", "Charlie Scharf", "And let me take V.me. So I think I\u2019ve talked to on the prior year\u2019s call we have learned an awful lot since our initial rollout of V.me and we have altered our approach to really take away all the functionality other than what I described before as meaningful digital acceptance. And so we\u2019re getting really excellent feedback from merchants and issuers alike. We\u2019ve actually rolled out the first phase of the new platform a few months ago and we have begun launching it with those merchants. It\u2019s incredibly -- it's just hugely more simple for them to actually integrate it into their checkout experience literally days as opposed to months and the new integrations that we have include Lululemon, Autozone, Petco and the Wine Enthusiast. But probably more exciting those are terrific names but we\u2019ve also executed term sheets or master service agreements with an additional 38 large merchants which represent almost 60 billion in addressable volume. 23 of those merchants are actually in the Internet Retailer Top 100. So we\u2019re going to -- we're continuing a press forward, we have a much better solution in the market, and it\u2019s resonating.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Yes hi thanks. A couple of things, regarding just I want to clarify, so you\u2019re EPS guidance fully contemplates the tax benefit you received in the quarter. Please clarify that. And secondly, regarding Russia, should we see the changes to law that you discussed earlier, specifically related to the basically trapping data and transaction flow and what not we\u2019ve seen in Russia. Is your current network structure capable of doing that, as of tomorrow. Because if I remember correctly, you guys were in a hub and spoke network where your data flows back through the states?", "Byron Pollitt", "Let me take the tax and EPS question first. The direct answer to your question is yes. The tax benefit that we recorded this quarter was contemplated in our full year guidance. That said, let me just provide updated perspective. When we give guidance as we did at the beginning of the fiscal year, so this was back in October, our style is to offer guidance without caveat and without excuse. And so when we give guidance it is naturally broader and have to take into a number of unknowns and you make educated judgments on how the year would unfold. The rate of economic recovery, unknown, cross-border impacts given a stronger U.S. dollar and currency movements, unknown, cross-border impacts due to global tensions, unknown.", "Thing about taxes is that as you get into the range where we are currently operating on taxes, this becomes more initiative driven as opposed to where your operating throughout the country, throughout the world. And so as these initiatives, as this one often take several years to research, prepare, occur, recording, and so the timing of these is often outside of our immediate control and therefore unknown with regards to when we can actually take them. And so all of these things are contemplated. We did contemplate including tax. We also began the year with a range of revenue that was low double-digits constant dollar which was 10% to 13%. Had we delivered in 12% to 13% constant dollar as opposed to what we are now seeing given other impacts in other areas of 10 to 11, then we would have been at the upper-end, certainly at the upper-end of our guidance if not a little above because more than one factor is playing out in our favor to a greater degree than we might have contemplated in the beginning. So that\u2019s the context. Charlie, Russia?", "Charlie Scharf", "So let me.", "Byron Pollitt", "So it\u2019s like, it\u2019s on to the Russian expert here.", "Charlie Scharf", "So on the question, and I just want to reiterate to be clear that the law is still evolving. As it gets red, it does evolve and get -- and there are changes that occur from day-to-day, and then once the law is actually passed there do have to be regulations to coincide with those laws before they get implemented. So there are some things in the law which there would be relatively quick implementation. There are other things which I think some of the dates go out until 2016.", "To answer your specific question, today, we do not have the ability, in a very quick way to deploy a separate version of VisaNet in a specific country. Having said that, we do have instances where we can start to move parts of it, whether authorization is much easier for us to do than entire clearing and settlement, and there it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re capable of building even though it might take a little bit of time. But also remember, I mean this is critical, because you\u2019ve got very much, we\u2019re caught between the politics of the United States and the politics of Russia. But you just get down to reality for a second. We have 100 million cards in Russia today. We have 100 million cards there and if not in anyone\u2019s best interest inclusive of the Russians to make those cards not available to their own citizens.", "And so that\u2019s why we are hopeful that as this situation unfolds, that people understand things like that and that to the extent that they believe it\u2019s important to build a national payment system. It can be done in a way where there is the appropriate transition and we have the ability to figure out whether it makes sense to compete in that marketplace, because there would be unlikely that, unless there\u2019s some draconian things that are passed that it wouldn\u2019t evolve in a way like that.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Just on that point, because I think this is important looking out concerning the NSA concerns and what not, if they did go ahead and make those changes have you contemplated the length of time it would take to restructure your network to comply because this could apply in the future to how China opens up. And we know that your biggest competitor is already there with the technology in place so if it was a short window, given a conversion could theoretically be done away from you.", "Charlie Scharf", "Okay, so two different things, number one is absolutely we\u2019ve done an awful lot of work and you can assume that we\u2019re preparing for everything that we should prepare to, the second is, I would just caution you to make the statements that others can comply.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA", "Okay, thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open.", "David Togut - Evercore", "Thank you very much, can you give us an update on the size of the commercial card as a percentage of total volumes and give us also a sense of the growth rate and whether that\u2019s been affected at all by the issues you put forward today?", "Byron Pollitt", "On the first part of your question, no, not, but Investor Relations could give you an update on that afterwards, let me just quickly look, commercial payment volume growth, we can give you a perspective from the U.S., and since the beginning of the calendar year it has been low double-digit growth, very high single to low double-digit growth consistently January, February, March, with an uptick in April.", "David Togut - Evercore", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. I just want to shift gears to margins for a minute, the personal expense came in below our estimates and you also raised your outlook for margins to the mid 60s versus low 60s previously. First, is there anything new that\u2019s driving the change versus your initial expectation and can we expect that to really continue off of a new base being mid 60s now into future years, and then just a quick housekeeping Byron, I know that you -- you should metrics into April 21, most of them looked like they were expanding or accelerating, just what impact did Easter actually have, given the timing in April this year versus last year, I don\u2019t know if you said that on the call before? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "We didn\u2019t, what I said on the call beginning with the April results is that it\u2019s very clear, I\u2019ve been in a form of retail for 18 years before coming to Visa, the Easter impact is absolutely a phenomenon that exists, typically you look at the run rate going in, the run rate going out, you compare it to the prior year. we\u2019re several weeks away from being able to do that metric but the lift, part of the lift is certainly due to Easter, it\u2019s also sensible that part of the lift could well be a return to be more normal weather, it\u2019s very hard to isolate specific weather impacts but we have done a lot of work around those states in the U.S. for example that had much more severe weather than normal versus those that didn\u2019t, the growth rates, there\u2019s a clear delta in the growth rates, some of it but not all of it mitigated by e-commerce, so as we get back to more normal periods post Easter, post weather, I think we\u2019ll see a more normalized growth rate and one that may very well have some pent up demand fueling it.", "With regards to expenses, the, at some point predictably as we continue to invest aggressively in extending our network, the reach of our network like a CyberSource, those, that investment will come with margins that are not that attractive or we wouldn\u2019t invest but they\u2019re not going to be in the 60s, we\u2019ve not reached that inflection point yet, and so that\u2019s why you saw us on the margin move up from low 60s to low to mid 60s, and with regards to personnel if you think about it, when we went public in 2008, we had 4,000 plus employees, today we have 10,000. And so in the span of a little over five years we have more than doubled our employee base and we go in searches, we digest, we optimize, we go forward, we will continue to invest in talent which is a key driver of our success and we would expect growth of the personnel base that you see today despite the more than doubling of our personnel over the past five years.", "Jack Carsky", "Adrian, at this point we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay our final question is from Jennifer Dugan of Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Dugan - Sterne, Agee", "Thank you, most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering could you give us a little bit more color on the expected fiscal 2015 revenue impact from the Chase conversion that\u2019s going to happen towards the end of the year?", "Byron Pollitt", "At this point we would, we do expect to have an impact, it should not be, it\u2019s a valued and important addition to our business, I think to the extent that we wouldn\u2019t give color on that specifically but we do expect it to start showing up in the first fiscal quarter and I\u2019ll remind the group, some of the conversions are taking place today and will pick up pace or expected to pick up pace as the year unfolds, but to the extent that that revenue shows up in service fees, we book our service fees on a one quarter lag, so any conversions that take place say in the fourth fiscal quarter, the service fees won\u2019t show up until the first fiscal quarter of fiscal \u201915.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today, if anybody has follow-up questions feel free to call Investor Relations.

Scharf - CEO", "Analysts", "Operator", "Welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s Fiscal Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session of today's call. Today\u2019s conference is also being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Charles. Good afternoon everybody and welcome to Visa's earnings conference call today. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, we continue to experience solid constant dollar payment volume payment volume growth in the low double-digit range both in the US and in internationally. That said, we see no signs yet of any acceleration in economic recovery and cross-border volume growth remained soft in the mid-single-digits.", "Turning to revenue, as expected and previewed on our call last quarter, revenue growth further moderated growing 7% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 5% nominally which reflects the two percentage points of FX headwind we have experienced since the beginning of the fiscal year.", "As a reminder, the current Q3 is lapping 17% nominal revenue growth in the prior year quarter which benefited from a number of favorable one-time adjustments.", "It is worth noting that the international revenue grew it only 1% this quarter despite cross-border constant dollar volume growth of 7%. While unfavorable FX is a partial explanation, the bigger impact is the significant reduction in currency volatility which has a direct impact on our international revenues. We expect both of these factors to reverse overtime.", "Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a rebound in nominal revenue growth on the order of 2 to 3 percentage points compared to Q3. This rebound is about 2 percentage points than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call primarily due to a 1 percentage point drop in cross-border transaction growth and unusually low levels of volatility across a broad range of currencies.", "So, that means for the full fiscal year 2014, we now expect revenue growth in the 9% to 10% range on a constant dollar basis with guarded optimism that the moderation in cross-border volume growth has dropped. After FX impacts that translates into nominal revenue growth of 7% to 8%.", "Client incentives for the fiscal third quarter came in lower than we had anticipated at our last earnings call due primarily to the timing associated with several major deals which have now been either signed or we expect to sign in the fiscal fourth quarter. With this in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to around 17% from the prior range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Let me also point out that mathematically this puts the fourth quarter at north of 19%.", "In terms of EPS, on a fiscal year 2014 basis, we are narrowing our guidance for diluted earnings per share to be in the 17.5% to 18.5%. Lastly, we remain confident in our future growth prospects and fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of $5.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $207 in change resulting in a total cost of $1.2 billion. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of $1.9 billion at the end of June and as always we will take advantage of market movements to repurchase at attractive prices.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. Let me start with what I stated last quarter though we are seeing a sustained economic recovery, there are no signs yet of acceleration either domestically or internationally. Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 11%, a 1 percentage point decline from the March quarter, the U.S. grew 10% and international grew 13%.", "Drilling down further for the June quarter, U.S. credit growth was 12% slight improved to 14% growth. U.S. debit was 8% in Q3, a 1 percentage point improvement compared to Q2 through July 21st, U.S. debit is flat at 8% growth. Taking together U.S. payment volume growth through July 21 was 11%, up 1 percentage point from the Q3 level.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a 7% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter slightly down from 8% in the March quarter. U.S. and international both grew at 7%. Through July 21st, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis held steady at 7% growth with the U.S. growing 6% and international registering 7% growth.", "For the June ending quarter, the sequentially downtick of 1 percentage point in cross-border was broad-based and spread across China, Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina and the Middle East as you might expect, given political tensions and the early on-set of Ramadan.", "Speaking of Ramadan, when interpreting to Q4 cross-border trends keep in mind that the timing of Ramadan in 2014 benefits August at the expense of July. ", "Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $16.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period, same growth rate as Q2. The U.S. grew 9% while international delivered 20% growth. Through July 21st, processed transaction growth moderated to a 9% growth rate. The notable drop in July is largely due to the lapping of significant debit wins in Brazil in June 2013 where our debit processing penetration went from zero to well above 50%.", "Now, turning to the income statements. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in service and data processing globally and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2 percentage point foreign currency headwind.", "Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.3 billion, up 11% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions both in the U.S. and internationally. ", "As highlighted earlier, international transaction revenue was up 1% to $860 million versus 7% constant dollar volume growth over the prior year period, as a result of a broad range of currencies experiencing volatility well below the 10 year trend line in contrast to the year ago quarter when volatility was near record highs. We would expect a return to a more normal volatility pattern in the coming quarters.", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Certain expenses have slipped to the fiscal fourth quarter while some specific personnel and professional fees those sequentially higher than the prior quarter were comping off of higher levels of the expense in the year ago period. We expect elevated marketing investments in the Q4 more comparable to Q2 levels tied to the FIFA World Cup in combination with significant investments in the support of the recent rollout of Visa Checkout. Operating margin was 64% for the third quarter, in line with our annual guidance of low to mid 60s. Capital expenditures were $109 million in the quarter. ", "At the end of the June quarter, we had $624 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $628 million. ", "Finally, given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, let me recap our 2014 full year guidance. Constant dollar net revenue growth of 9% to 10% which when combined with 2 percentage points of negative FX impact; yield nominal revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Client incentives around 17%; operating margin in the low to mid 60s; tax rate between 30% and 31%; EPS growth in the 17.5% to 18.5% range and free cash flow of about $5 billion.", "Before I turn the call over to Charlie, let me provide some early perspective on fiscal 2015. In short, we are approaching 2015 bullish on the long-term but cautious in the short term. Here are some of the underlying observations and assumptions in forming our planning for next year. ", "First, while we expect U.S. and international payment volume growth to remain healthy, we have not yet seen acceleration in global economic growth. Cross-border transactions appear to be troughing in the 6% to 7% growth range on a constant dollar basis. As a perspective, we know that these growth rates can recover significantly without notice and that the notable declines in Latin American growth rates lap in January of 2015 and the market declines related to the Russian-Ukraine will lap in March, everything else equal once these events anniversary to pick up in cross-border growth could be in the 2 to 3 percentage point range.", "As the currency volatility, not sure when this trend reverses. We only know from an historical perspective we are overdue for a correction and such shifts and trend can be quick and sizable. Consistent with past strategies, we remained focused on growing revenues for converting more cash volume to electronic payments with a growing emphasis on digital.", "In addition, we expect the successful growth in our client payment volumes for both issuers and merchants to result in higher levels of planned incentives as measured by percent of gross revenues.", "Turning to Russia, while this situation is still very much influx, we anticipate being a part of a commercial solution that will be implemented in 2015 which will likely resolve in the loss of about 50 million in domestic Russian processing revenue.", "Looking further down the income statement, we see no step function change in our tax rate at this time. That said, we are working diligently on a more fully realizing our opportunities related to foreign tax credits.", "Finally, consistent with past practice, we expect to deploy our excess cash flow in 2015 to service our dividend and to repurchase our shares. In sum, we remain bullish on the future but recognize that in today's economic environment we must work through several challenges before we can once again resume more normalized rates of growth. As is our practice on the Q4 earnings call, we will provide more color on 2015.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Thank you very much, Byron. Byron did cover the financial results in a fair amount of detail but I just thought I'd just pass on a few quick thoughts.", "First of all, the quarterly results did come in where we expect. The revenue growth being impacted by the year-over-year comps with the strong U.S. dollar and the tepid growth from cross-border payment volume in these specific geographies was what we expected. And we reiterate that we are confident that these headwinds we do not feel are permanent.", "More importantly for the long-term, global payments volume and processed transactions remained healthy and strong. Also our issuer contract pipeline is very strong. So, all in all we are gratified to be able to deliver 50% earnings per share growth given the environment and what we've discussed.", "Let me turn out for a second and talk about Russia. As you all know by reading the newspapers and watching the news, the situation continues to evolve. The recent additional sanctions have not forced us to curtail business with additional clients and as of today, our domestic and international business continues.", "This concludes completing term sheets and contracts regarding our brand relationships during this quarter with significant Russian clients which we're gratified about but we continue to focus on developing a domestic processing solution and we're actively engaged with the Russian government and the Russian banks to develop a commercial solution which will allow us to continue serve our Russian clients.", "Most limiting provisions of the new law going to effect in October and we are working to have a solution implemented by that time. Having said that and as Byron mentioned, we do expect to lose a portion of our domestic processing revenues over the next year which will reset our base from which we expect to achieve good growth.", "Now, let me turn for a second and talk about what we're seeing in our client activity around the globe. We did have a good quarter regarding issuing co-brand contracts just a few significant examples. In U.S. we renewed our credit card relationships with the American Eagle Outfitters and high hotels and resorts. ", "In Canada earlier this month, we launched a new relationship with CIBC for Tim Hortens which is the largest QSR in Canada. It's a significant co-brand offering and a no fee rewards space reported by innovative product features and real-time awards. It's called the Double Double Visa Card, it leverages the first of its kind dual button technology that combines a CIBC Visa Credit Card for payments with a classic Tim Card for rewards. Cardholders simply press CIBC Visa button on the front of the card to pay for their everyday purchases anywhere Visa accepted or they can choose to press the Tim Card button and then use the same card to redeem their Tim cash for their favorite coffee and menu items at Hortens. New card is also, also offers the convenience of Visa payWave and the security of chip and pin technology that consumers in Canada enjoy today. On the issuing side, we also renewed a multiyear agreement with the Royal Bank of Canada an important and long-standing client of Visa.", "We also signed a number of other significant new multiyear agreements around the globe. In Australia, we will be the exclusive card net worth for a Woolworths money credit card partnership. Woolworths is Australia\u2019s larger retailer. In China, we renewed our credit partnership deals with China Industrial Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corporation, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. In Korea, we signed a new debit partnership agreement with [Pona SK] and a new credit debit agreement with [Woori] card. In Saudi Arabia, the Saudi British Bank will convert their debit card portfolio to Visa from a competitor and bank Saudi frenzy has renewed their credit, debit and prepaid agreement. In the UAE, Visa signed new credit deal with Mashreq Bank including an exclusive card for high net worth individuals.", "Turning to CyberSource for a second. We have discussed the weaker growth over the past few quarters increasing our rate of growth here it will take some time it\u2019s one account at a time and as Byron mentioned we are investing here to rebuild the higher growth rates.", "We recently announced a strategic global partnership with Amadeus, a leading technology provider for the global travel industry. Amadeus has integrated CyberSource's fraud management system decision manager into the Amadeus payment platform which can help travel organizations globally accept more bookings while identifying potential fraudulent transactions and lowering operational costs.", "Turning to payment security for a moment, earlier this year we formed a payment task force in partnership with other networks, merchants, issuers, acquirers and device manufacturers. We see real collaboration here which is terrific. We continue to work through a common roadmap for enhanced security in the U.S. topics include EMV, tokenization, end-to-end encryption and coordinated communications. The Group is working very well together and we would expect the Group to have some things to talk about publicly in the near future.", "Let me talk for a few minutes now about our work in digital commerce. First of all, there is a lot of clutter in the market about who is doing what in the digital payment space. It can be confusing for sure. We have a very specific point of view and a set of strategies here. Simply put we are keenly focused on achieving the same success in the digital world that we have had in the physical world. This mean focusing on tangible activities in the marketplace that help accelerate digital commerce with Visa as a platform partner.", "As in the side our card not present volumes today are growing three times as fast as card present which we feel is still just a fraction of the opportunity in this space. We are focused on two different but related things. ", "Number one, bring digital payments to the physical world and number two, enabling digital payments in the connected world. To do this, we are materially changing how we do business. Historically we would only allow access to our capabilities through issuers and acquirers and for them it wasn't particularly easy. Today we're simplifying access for our traditional partners but we're also enabling a much broader set of partners to access these platforms in ways we have not allowed historically so, they can build experiences that use our payment of capabilities. This includes partners such as merchants, technology companies both big and small, mobile operators, device manufacturers, other payment companies, social networks and the broader application developer community. Including these partners means exposing web services so they can connect with us.", "To help drive innovation, last week we opened a 100,000 square feet of innovation center in San Francisco. The space is all about collaboration, it\u2019s one of a series of physical spaces which we will have, which provide a physical environment where we can sit side-by-side with partners traditional and new big and small to create experiences using our capabilities.", "We're also investing in younger companies such as DocuSign and [Loop]. As a group investments like these and there are more to come keep us close to innovators in our space. Being part of the dialogue is important. Bear in mind, we are not looking to pick exclusive winners here, but we do want to enable a series of people who we think can help drive payment electronification.", "To support our digital activities today we announced Visa Digital Solutions. This suite of services extends our support for mobile payments to enable retailers, financial institutions and developers to create new ways to pay via mobile devices. Specifically, we published specifications in software development kits to make it easier for financial institutions, merchants and developers to create new ways to pay using our products on mobile devices using Visa payWave and QR codes. ", "We have also published APIs and SDKs to enable merchants and developers to embed simplified payments within their web and mobile sites as well as the mobile applications using Visa Checkout which I\u2019ll talk a bit more about in a moment. These services are now available and there will be more coming throughout the year.", "The second category is aimed at protecting consumer account information. Our new token services are part of this. I\u2019d mentioned this before but most people are focused on the security benefits of tokenization and they are real. But with tokens new players and importantly non-traditional payment providers such as developers and merchants can build applications that access payment information in a safe secure manner not possible before. This means on digital devices wherever there is an Internet connection regardless of the form factor including ones that don\u2019t exist today. Developers will be able to integrate Visa payment capabilities.", "Merchants, developers and banks will start offering token-based payments in September of this year. We are also launching a more robust developer center in early 2015 but we\u2019ll extend the capabilities we exposed to the developer community. ", "In addition to all of this we\u2019re creating a suite of services to enable banks to issue and manage Visa accounts and secure \\virtual clouds. This again allows developers to create commerce opportunities to integrate our payments products and capabilities wherever there is an Internet connection.", "Last week, we launched Visa Checkout replacing V.me in the marketplace. We've learned a lot over the past year and a half through candid conversations with issuers, acquirers and merchants. In addition to consumer research on the topic of digital wallets and digital acceptance. Our goal is simple, we want our clients and their customers to be able to use our products in the digital world as easily as they can in the physical world. This means we\u2019ve designed Visa Checkout to be the Visa Card in the digital world that means a simple buying experience for consumers, clear branding for issuers and simple integration with merchants, it also means preserving the roles in the payments chain as they exist today. Visa Checkout accomplishes all of this. ", "For the consumer they can pay with the username and password with just a few clicks whatever they see their card and Visa Checkout online. For the issuer clear branding throughout the Checkout experience and for the merchant easy integration of a product one which will help increases the rate at which sales are consummated online. As I said Visa Checkout is simply a Visa Card in the digital world. ", "As I mentioned earlier with this launch a new mobile software development kit is also available allowing developers to quickly build and implement an in-app Checkout experience for iOS and Android based devices. We will drive broad awareness for Visa Checkout through a significant advertising campaign recently launched in the digital and social channels and on television later this year. The campaign will feature participating merchants and a broad range of consumer offers and promotions. We\u2019re thrilled with our partners who are part of the launch. On the financial institution side they include more than 180 financial institutions and organizations, big and small, the list includes U.S. issuers such as Bank of America, BB&T, BBVA Compass, CSCU which is the card services for credit unions, Chase Citi, ICBA Bank Card, Navy Federal Credit Union, PMC, Regions, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. ", "We\u2019re also thrilled to have great merchants as partners in our launch some of which are following Neiman Martins, Staples, Pizza Hut, United Airlines, Petco, Wine Enthusiast, Adorama, Jos. A. Bank, Rakuten, Ticketmaster and Live Nation, over 170 merchants are live in Australia, Canada and the U.S. representing approximately 20 billion in total addressable payment volume. The sales pipeline is also very strong with over 40 merchants at term sheet and or negotiating master service agreements representing an additional $37 billion in addressable volume including some great sizable brands. ", "In summary, our job at Visa is to help pro-commerce by providing a platform to integrate but we think is the best payment brand instead of capabilities in the world into new buying experiences simply and securely. These experiences will certainly make it easier to pay by eliminating physical cards overtime but the driver of behavioral change will be the experiences that can now be created on mobile devices that cannot be created on plastic, because the mobile device is connected and interactive and these experiences will become the real reason to pay digitally overtime. ", "We believe that you will start to see these experiences in the near future and are excited about what they mean for everyone involved in commerce and will be an important part of our future.", "We look forward to discussing these specific experiences and their positive impact to Visa over the coming quarters.", "And with that operator, I think Byron and I are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks guys. Just wanted to ask about the cross-border little bit more since obviously that remains a high priority focus area for folks. Can you give us any commentary whether some of the slowdown has been more on the consumer side relative to the commercial side? And then just any thoughts on the gap between your growth in this metric and that of your biggest competitor? At least through the March quarter we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done for the June quarter. But it just looks like that gap has gotten little bit bigger. I\u2019m curious if you guys have done any market intelligence to get a better understanding of that, and is there anything structural there we should be thinking about?", "Charles W. Scharf", "So let me start off with the first part of the question. It\u2019s very corridor specific. So let me just highlight a few of the corridors that we saw the deceleration in cross-border from Q2 to Q3. And many of these will come as no surprise. Generally from Russia to the European countries, from Argentina, Venezuela to the European countries. The European countries to Ukraine, Russia to Ukraine, Ukraine to the European countries.", "So from that standpoint those are the key quarters that moved the needle. We know that it is pretty broad based and in this case many of these are just situationally specific. With regards to second part of your question, recognizing that Visa, Inc. does not have Europe. We are comfortable that at least half the difference in cross-border growth rates is attributable to Europe and the remainder we have under study. We also know given the ebb and flow of certain portfolio movements that some of that is country-specific and we are very focused on reversing those trends in the coming quarters.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Our next question comes from Sanjay from KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW", "Thank you. I guess I had a question on the hedges and the volatility observation or point. Could you talk about what would happen if volatility doesn\u2019t come back into the FX market? I mean, does that serve as a headwind for period of time then?", "Charles W. Scharf", "So let me separate hedges and volatility. Because the two are completely independent to each other. When we speak of hedges this is simply basically a 12 month program where we try and dampen the fluctuations in FX when we translate net revenue or earnings positions earned in foreign currencies back in to our financial statements.", "Cross-border is impacted but to a modest degree and these are hedges in the traditional sense, simply in put in place to dampen the volatility of naturally occurring changes and currencies relative to the dollar overtime. The volatility is a different animal. Every year, if we look back over the past year, we will have performed currency translations services for over a $150 billion in value in order to facilitate the settlement of transactions where Visa Card is -- whose account is denominated in one currency is used in a country where the currency is different and so over the course of the year as I indicated we do over $150 billion of those kinds of currency translation services. ", "The way we earn a very small spread on those transaction. The way the spread is calculated, it's an algorithm that is based on the actual volatility of our currency in a given day. Those that volatility is something we have studied over a long period of time. There is during the course of a year often quite a bit of volatility but the amount tends to revert back to a mean overtime. So we would expect what we're seeing and as example if we were to look at the month of June, June had the lowest volatility that we have seen in 15 years. So from that standpoint we view this much more as of the moment that it should resume back to sort of normalized volatility levels which has been our experience since we've gone public. And that's how we're anticipating this trend for the future.", "Jack Carsky", "Our next question Charles.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jim, Jim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your commentary regarding incentives for the fiscal '15. Specifically how many of your top 10 issuing clients are expected to come up for renewal next year?", "Charles W. Scharf", "So, what we would typical do on the Q4 call is give you a sense of the full year expectations for incentives so you can expect that on the Q4 call in October. It is our practice to give incentive projections or guidance on a yearly basis not by quarter and we would characterize our pipeline of deals as it was healthy this year. It's a healthy pipeline of renewals next year as well and the impact -- the expected impact will characterize that in a range and share with you all on the fourth quarter earnings call.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, Charles?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Darrin from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Charlie just first a higher level question. I mean you mentioned in your remarks, I think in the press release that longer, you believe Visa should be able to grow the revenue in the double-digit range, can you just highlight and perhaps rank for us what the key drivers you think would be that would enable the growth to improve given the higher base which we're growing now? And then maybe just near term, on the near term side Byron is a follow up to that question I mean I guess what people are trying to figure out is if there is higher level of incentives in fourth quarter is actually new business that could drive that part of that acceleration next year? Thanks guys.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah. So, let me start with -- start this which is -- again the way we look at our numbers, as we look at what our revenue growth is excluding the items that we talk about here as headwinds. And again I said this in my remarks, we do believe that these headwinds are not permanent and so if you just look at the headwinds that we've had far in the foreign currency translation and the currency volatility, the impact on the comps year-over-year and this growth in cross-border payments which we should point out can move either way very, very rapidly and we've got amazing data to back that up.", "When you just back out these headwinds which we do believe are temporary, our growth underlying all that is still very, very strong which you can see in the transaction processing growth and the overall payments growth.", "So, as we -- so we talk about generating reasonable returns over a period of time, there is the long term which is affected by the things we're doing in the digital world we think which is certainly helpful but then there is this other defined period once we get through these headwinds and the issue that we have is we don't know exactly when they are going to reverse but we're very confident that they will.", "Byron Pollitt", "With regards to the second part of your question recognizing that a typical contract with last five years some longer. We entered into contracts with the expectation that they will drive growth over that five year period. How we structure the incentives makes a big difference with regards to what kind of growth we may or not see in the first quarter as we've talked about over the years, some of the deal renewal entail more meaningful upfront payments that from a gap standpoint we might have to record more fully in the income statement versus amortize over the term of the contract. And so there is a lot that goes into how you structure deal and then how it\u2019s translated onto the books. But since Charlie\u2019s comment was based over the -- and we see our self in the longer-term returning to double-digit revenue growth, the answer is we would expect these deals to build on a foundation that would drive growth over the term of the period that what enabled us to achieve that objective.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question Charles.", "Operator", "Yes, sir. And next question comes from Moshe from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. Charlie when you talked about tokenization, could you talk about whether that is something that is going to kind of bring revenues into the system and will those be revenues that go to the networks did they share I mean could you talk a little bit whether those are they just going to be something that\u2019s going to an additional form of security?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think the answer which is yes it\u2019s an additional form of security for sure. We think of it as driving more network volume that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to get because other people can now participate and embed payments in different applications and experiences out there because it\u2019s safe and secure because of the tokens. This isn't a question of getting paid specifically for tokenization. It really is about driving more volume through our issuers or merchants and ultimately to us as well as part of that.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Smitti from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you. Charlie I just wanted to follow-up on a statement that you made earlier about your new strategy on the digital front, I\u2019d thought I heard that you say you allowed new ways for parties to access your network directly so, does that mean eventually merchants and other technology partners will no longer need to connect your network through in wire? And if that\u2019s the case well settle the transaction?", "Charles W. Scharf", "", "No, I didn\u2019t say that, what I said was that that we are exposing the capabilities so that different parties including merchants can embed Visa payments into their experiences but very importantly it preserves the role that issuers, acquirers play in the system today. So, what we're trying to do is again historically we've had great relationships with issuers and acquirers still do, but anyone who is trying to build an experience for an application would have to then go through multiple issuers and multiple acquirers to get that experience to market in a meaningful way and by exposing our capabilities directly to them, it allows more people to be creative relative to helping drive digital commerce in a way that uses our payments as a platform for them but it keeps the flows of information, the flow of data and the flow of economics the same as it is today in the fourth party system.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for the clarification.", "Jack Carsky", "", "Next question Charles.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, I just want to follow-up Byron your comments on \u201915. I didn\u2019t hear any comments on the operating margin do you still expect to get leverage in \u201915 on the operating margin? And then secondly, just an update on the Chase migration volume that is expected are we a quarter way through just trying to get a sense of how much we're through in that migrating of that volume? Thanks so much.", "Charles W. Scharf", "The only thing before Byron answer the question, let me answer that operating margin it\u2019s -- we really have to think about incentives as a meaningful cost of doing business here as well.", "Byron Pollitt", "And the two should be viewed in combination and with the exception of -- what happen to our incentive line after the great recession that has gradually moved up and the activity and a few comments on H1 performance highlighting the most significant points. ", "Charles W. Scharf", "But even beyond the three months because I think -- the way we think about where we are is we are not in an environment where it\u2019s very easy to predict the next quarter or the quarter after that just given what\u2019s going on in the world and these trends that we\u2019ve seen which affect our revenue numbers materially.", "Again as I said before, we feel very confident that the headwinds will dissipate. We know that at some point the economy will be more helpful across the globe, what we don\u2019t know is the timing. And we certainly can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what it will be a year from now. And that is still only half way through next year. So as the world evolves and as these issues evolved and we get closer to the time period, it\u2019s obviously by definition easier for us to talk about it.", "Byron Pollitt", "Just a quick word on Chase. The current quarter\u2019s result to the extent that they include any of the conversions it\u2019s not material. And remembering this will hit the service fee line and we report the service fee line on a one quarter lag. Before we see much impact from the conversion it will really be for us that December ending quarter which will be the first quarter of the next fiscal year. But at the present no material impact on the quarter\u2019s results and frankly not a material impact on the Q4 results either.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, Charles?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin from JP Morgan Chase. Your line is now open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase", "Great. Thanks. Just wanted to I guess clarify what\u2019s driving the software revenue outlook for the fourth quarter? Just wanted to make sure I caught it correct. It sounds like it's lower cross border plus lack of volume acceleration I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incentive driven. Just wanted to clarify that. And then my -- the question I wanted to ask was actually on Visa Checkout and the strategy there to get consumer signed up and to use Visa Checkout versus whatever PayPal or any other digital payment method you can think of. Because if we get questions all day today about Apple and other initiatives I\u2019m just trying to understand how that\u2019s going to play out versus something else? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "Okay. So let me take the first part. With regards very specifically to the Q4, which is really how we're then going to finish out the year, it compared to where we were on the third quarter call, what\u2019s different primarily is a downtick in the cross-border, so if you have that right and continued depressed, historically depressed volatility levels from a currency standpoint. And for those were -- our position has moved a bit more conservative from where we were on the prior quarter call. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with incentives because what didn\u2019t get booked this quarter. Our assumption is that it'll get booked in the current quarter. And we're already signing deals to validate that. And remember our incentive guidance was 16.5% to 17.5% and we narrated to about 17%. So we're right down the middle of the fair way.", "Charles W. Scharf", "But as we sit here and just think about from this quarter to next quarter we are not assuming any kind of meaningful change in these headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about which again are possible and will happen, we just don\u2019t know the timing and just given the math that Byron said next quarter\u2019s incentives will be higher than this quarter's incentives and he talked about that during his remarks. And the Visa Checkout question. I don\u2019t remember what the exact question was? The question Tien-Tsin are you still there?", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase", "Yeah, I am here just wanted to clarify Charlie just in the strategy to get consumers signed up for Visa Checkout versus some all the other stuff that's out there PayPal and I guess Amazon is talking about, just trying to understand how you'll solve the consumer side of equation? And then I guess if I can get a chance here if you can address Apple and iBall or whatever all the press has been talked about with your partnership there I think that would great and how that would fit with, with your digital strategy? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Sure, so, listen I think on the answer to the first question about my words is why Visa Checkout for an consumer and how we're going to activate the consumers around the world to use this product as opposed to something else. From our perspective what\u2019s different about this versus the other things that you mentioned are the relationships that we have with banks, right. Again we've got two point 2 billion cards around the world and we think about the people who were willing to support this with their names in the press release, a bunch of them come to a launch event that we had here, these are amazing names. These banks talk to their clients regularly and over the next six months you'll start to see banks do different things to enable their customers in a very proactive way to use Visa Checkout. So, it's one thing for us to sit here and say we're going to try and do it, that would be very, very difficult, the reason why we're confident that will be successful because we do it in partnership with the banks because it's their clients. We provide support. Our marketing and advertising is going to do that again, we've got some really need stuff in the digital and social channels. ", "As Byron mentioned in his remarks we are going to -- we intend to spend a significant amount in marketing including TV as we go into the back-to-school season and then again for the leading up to the Christmas. So, it\u2019s going to be hard not to know what Visa Checkout and why you should have it and so, we are pretty about that. And Apple I am not going to address anything specifically out there but again we have we have said this before we talked to a whole range of people who historically work doing significant things and payment and those that are and we're very excited about some of the things that we talking to potential partners about and over the next three months, six months, nine months, we hope some of those things will actually be in the market place you will be as excited about as we are.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question Charles.", "", "Operator", "Next question comes from Bob from William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company", "Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up a few of the 2015 comments. We talk a lot -- you talk a lot about currency volatility, can you maybe put some numbers around is that 1% of revenue effect versus your guidance and then in talking about 2015 your tax rate it was little, the full year tax rate for this year you are expecting it flat and then you are still getting double-digit payment volume growth as people think about revenue and higher as the double-digit payment volume growth do you still expect to be able to attain that next year?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me start off on the currency volatility we don\u2019t we are not record with talking about specific amounts that this is as you can imagine a part of, it's pretty fundamental to the Visa global acceptance composition that we be in a position to perform currency translation services so, this is something that we have done for ever and we do it in a way that actually delivers a pretty attractive cardholder proposition as a part of the disclosures for someone that receives the Visa Card they are told that they are guaranteed a wholesale rate and I am hard for us personally to think of any other situation where a consumer, a cardholder would have available to them a wholesale currency translation rate. That\u2019s what we do we take a very small spread on that to cover our operations and it's related how much the spread is related to currency volatility and I have talked about that from time-to-time on currency I mean on earnings calls. It rarely has this level of impact but as we said earlier we are at levels of currency volatility that we haven't seen in 15 years tax rate.", "So, with the guidance of this call we have given very specific guidance of 30 to 31 and have indicated that next year not to expect any step function rate. We did have an important tax adjustment last quarter that represented both a catch up and a permanent ongoing reduction in our tax rate because there was a catch up one might naturally wonder whether that impact is something that would be onetime and then the rate might naturally gravitate back up in the following year. Hence in my remarks I mentioned that we are hard at work and fully realizing foreign tax credit opportunities. And so we expect that to help inform the rate for next year and underpin the comment that we don't at this point expect any step function change in the rate.", "With regards to double-digit payment volume growth, we certainly on a constant dollar basis this is the level of payment volume growth that is being produced with pretty anemic growth in economies. And so, as we look at the payment volume growth this is one of those factors that we think looking forward have certainly more upside than downside when never knows for shore but one I think would agree that the economic growth we've been experiencing over the past several years has been pretty anemic and hopefully nowhere to but up.", "Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company", "Great. Thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, Charles?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig from CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Craig Maurer - CLSA ", "Yeah. Good evening. Charlie, I wanted to ask you theoretically about the future with technology and the changes you're bringing to the online world that are absolutely focused on better securities you said, what are your thoughts about the sustainability of card not present interchange rates for banks when clearly those rates were predicated on higher fraud levels?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Listen, I am not going to talk about what we would be thinking about anything specific on interchange on a going forward basis. What I will remind and I know Craig we talked about this but it's always a good reminder to everyone. I don't know a lot of industries out there that price their services for anything other than the value received and the value received from products like ours in the card not present world is extraordinary. And we know the number of businesses that wouldn't that exist if it wasn't for our products. And if people want to go back to a COD world, we can certainly try that.", "So, as we sit here and continue to improve security and continue to build payments into people applications all with the point of view of helping them grow, we're going to be making sure that we think about looking at both sides of equation looking at what goes to the issuing side and to the acquiring side what is fair in terms of value received. And that could possibly evolve overtime. But again it's the value equation on both sides.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, Charles.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Christopher Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Byron I just want to explore one thing on your comment about the Chase business not appearing in the numbers in a material way, just looking at the volume from credit that was 12% year on year U.S. credit. 12% year on year growth in the June quarter and you said I think 14% through July 21st does that reflect any Chase business or is there some other dynamic going on there?", "Byron Pollitt", "It does but as it relates to conversion it's really not a material driver of those numbers. As the conversion picks up speed later in the year, we would expect to see more of an impact but currently it's not material.", "Jack Carsky", "At this point Charles, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Ken from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "Thanks. Good evening. Thank you for all the color you\u2019ve given us on the issue around cross-border I am hoping you might entertain one more question. You has pointed out last quarter that some of these quarter headwind is slowing volume obviously there is quarter is going to pick up and it\u2019s going to work out as it works out on the actual foreign exchange volatility side. Has this been something that has been, the volatility is dampening over time and it just became much more acute in the more recent quarter? And if you look back what would be kind of the right reference point just think about in terms of what volatility would look like, if you would?", "Byron Pollitt", "Honestly, we don\u2019t have a very good explanation. When you look at the patterns, volatility they are often event specific. During the period where Greece was rumored to be potentially exiting the Euro there was quite a bit of volatility in the Euro and that cross referenced against quite a few currencies.", "We thought that we would see some volatility return during the week where a Malaysian airliner was shot down. We have an event in Gaza and Portugal was in the news with regards to the stability of its participation in the Euro", "And yet those type of events which would have historically created volatility didn\u2019t. The one common denominator that we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters is just an exceptionally strong dollar and our hypothesis is that that may have something to do with it. But honestly we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis and look for a lot of correlations and just haven\u2019t been able to find one that offers much in a way of the respectable (inaudible)", "Charles W. Scharf", "", "But as Bryon said, what we saw recently are the lowest levels that we\u2019ve ever...", "Byron Pollitt", "In 15 years. ", "Charles W. Scharf", "15 years.", "Byron Pollitt", "So you can gravity for a while but not forever. And so in looking at 15 years\u2019 worth of data there are periods of comp that occur regularly during the course of the year. And then again looking at that timeline of data these can reverse very, very quickly often without notice. And so if past this prolong then it\u2019s just a matter of time before we hit an inflection point and it will go back to something more closer to lead way.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Charles. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s CEO; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our Web site prior to this call as well.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s Web site in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.", "For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Byron.", "Byron Pollitt", "Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, as you can see from our earnings press release, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis based on the litigation accrual we took in the wake of the $450 million escrow deposit we made in late September. As a reminder, this litigation provision is covered by our retrospective responsibility plan.", "The $450 million additional litigation accrual has been estimated off of recently completed settlements with selected opt-out merchants representing approximately 3% of the total opt-out merchants based on sales volume, as well as the status of negotiations and discussions with other opt-out merchants. Excluding this litigation accrual, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.18.", "In addition, consistent with past practice, the company\u2019s funding of the $450 million litigation escrow deposit had the same effect as a share repurchase, as it reduced the Class B share conversion ratio by an amount equivalent to buying back 2.1 million Class A equivalent shares at $215 per share. As a result, at the end of the fiscal year, we had 618 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis.", "We continued to experience solid constant dollar payment volume growth in the low double-digit range both in the U.S. and internationally. U.S. credit continued to strongly perform, led in large part by Chase portfolio conversions. That said, looking ahead to fiscal 2015, our near-term outlook remains cautious given the modest pace of economic recovery, the geopolitical situation, Ebola, low currency volatility and continued FX headwinds from a very strong U.S. dollar.", "Turning to revenue. As expected and previewed on our call last quarter, revenue growth for the fiscal fourth quarter rebounded growing 10% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 9% nominally, which reflects about 1 and 1.5 percentage points of FX headwind in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, revenue growth was 10% on a constant dollar basis and 8% nominally recognizing close to 2 percentage points of FX headwind for the entire fiscal year.", "A word on international transaction revenue. Revenue growth for the quarter was 4% compared to 9% nominal growth in the cross-border payment volume. The difference can be explained by the continuation of historically low currency volatility discussed last quarter. That said, we saw an uptick in volatility across a basket of currencies in September, which continued into October. While we remain cautious in projecting this metric, results in September and October are encouraging.", "Client incentives for the fiscal fourth quarter came in at 19.2% putting us right on target with our full year guidance of around 17%. As we telegraphed on last quarter\u2019s call, the elevated level of incentives was the result of key renewals in Canada and CEMEA which completed in fiscal Q4. I\u2019ll speak to fiscal 2015 in a moment.", "Lastly, as always, we remain confident in our future growth prospects and full committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, in Q4, we committed $1.2 billion to reduce the number of Class A equivalent shares by 5.7 million at an average price of $213. This was accomplished through open market purchases and as noted earlier, a deposit of $450 million in the company\u2019s litigation escrow account.", "Further, our Board approved in October a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization that in combination with the 682 million remaining from the prior authorization gives us 5.7 billion to deploy in the coming quarters. We also recently announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.48 per share. This level of increase is consistent with our previously stated objective of a 20% payout of the previous fiscal year\u2019s net income or in this case adjusted net income.", "Now let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 11%, slightly down from the June quarter. The U.S. grew 10% and international grew 13%. Drilling down further, for the September quarter, U.S. credit was 13% slightly higher than the 12% in Q3 in part due to Chase conversion activity.", "Through October 21, U.S. credit improved to 15% growth. U.S. debt was 7% in Q4, a 1 percentage point downshift compared to Q3. Through October 21, U.S. debt is back up at 8% growth. Taken together, U.S. payment volume growth through October 21 was 11%, up 1 percentage point from the Q4 level.", "Global cross-border volume delivered a 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, up nicely from 7% in the June quarter. The increase was attributable to stronger activity across a broader set of travel corridors with some effect from the timing of Ramadan. Notably, there was a nice pickup in travel to the EU from the Middle East, China and Australia. The U.S. grew at 7% and international grew at 11%.", "Through October 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis held steady at 10% growth with U.S. growth at 6% and international registering 11% growth. Underperforming travel corridors includes several countries in Latin America along with Russia and Ukraine.", "Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 16.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior year. The U.S. grew 8% while international delivered 14% growth. Through October 21, processed transaction growth improved to 11% growth rate, up 2 percentage points. The U.S. grew 9% while international grew 15%.", "Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year driven primarily by growth in service and data processing globally and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by about 1 and 1.5 percentage points of foreign currency headwind. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was 8% over the prior year or growth of 10% on a constant currency basis.", "Moving to the individual line items for the fiscal fourth quarter. Service revenue was 1.5 billion, up 8% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions both in the U.S. and internationally.", "The delta between the quarter\u2019s 9% processed transaction growth and the 14% revenue growth was largely due to higher year-over-year growth in U.S. debt fees implemented in 2012. Of the delta, approximately one-quarter was due to lapping a one-time refund of an overpayment in Q4 of the prior year. The balance is ongoing as this fee structure stabilizes after having been implemented two years ago.", "As highlighted earlier, international transaction revenue was up 4% to $938 million versus 10% constant dollar cross-border volume growth over the prior year period, as a result of a broad range of currencies experiencing volatility well below the 10-year median. In contrast to the year-ago quarter when volatility was near record highs, we are hopeful for a return to a more normalized volatility pattern in the coming quarters.", "Turning to other revenue, it showed a slight uptick in the quarter reflecting a true up of the Visa Europe licensing fee, some of which was catch-up. Initially, the licensing fee was $142.5 million annually. The annual rate for fiscal year 2015 will be around 148 million. Excluding the litigation provision, total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, flat from the prior year.", "For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating expenses were also flat to fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin was 62% for the fourth quarter and 64% for the full fiscal year both in line with our guidance of low to mid-60s. Capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter and 553 million for the full fiscal year. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 623 million and 631 million for the full fiscal year.", "Before I speak to specific items of guidance, let me provide some early perspective on how we see the timeline of fiscal full year 2015 playing out. We approach 2015 bullish on the long term, given the underlying strength in payment volumes and processed transactions and cautious in the short term. Here are some of the underlying observations and assumptions in forming our planning for next year.", "First, while we expect U.S. and international payment volume growth to remain healthy, we have not yet seen acceleration in global economic growth. Cross-border volumes are rebounding as we reported 10% growth in the quarter but this is still below the low double-digit levels we experienced at this point last year and so we remain appropriately conservative in positioning this metric.", "As a perspective, we know that these growth rates can recover without notice and that the notable declines in Latin American growth rates lap in January of 2015 and the market declines related to the Russian-Ukraine crisis will lap in March. Everything else equal, once these events anniversary, the pickup in cross-border growth could be in the 2 to 3 percentage point range. As to currency volatility, as I said earlier, while we have seen a bounce in September and October, we are not sure how sustainable this is.", "Turning to a different subject, we will be taking selected pricing actions commencing in April of 2015 on certain U.S. acquirer fees, which will result in higher revenue growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Given that we have not taken actions in this area in four years, we believe the length of time and the substantial value these cross-border transactions bring to merchants make a modest adjustment appropriate.", "In addition, based on recently completed significant client renewals that Charlie will speak to in a moment, as well as the successful growth in client payment volumes for both issuers and merchants, we will see higher levels of client incentives as measured by a percent of gross revenues with the highest percentage levels expected in the first half of the year.", "In dollar terms, quarterly incentives in fiscal 2015 should be more indicative of the $700 million plus level seen in fiscal Q4. Finally, consistent with past practice, we expect to deploy our excess cash flow in 2015 to service our recently increased dividend and to continue to repurchase our shares.", "To sum up, in terms of guidance for fiscal 2015, we are contemplating constant dollar revenue growth of low double digits with 2 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact. Absent any catalyst, we see our constant currency growth today at the very low end of the double-digit range.", "As previously stated, our guidance contemplates several pricing actions to be effective at the beginning of fiscal Q3. This means our year-over-year revenue growth rates are expected to be double digit in the second half and in the mid single-digit range in the first two quarters as we lap low levels in incentives in the prior year.", "Turning to client incentives, as a percentage of gross revenues, we expect it to be in a range of 17.5% to 18.5%, operating margin in the mid-60s, full year tax rate in the low 30s. On tax, as a reminder, when viewed quarterly on a year-over-year basis, the tax rate in Q2 of fiscal year 2014 was significantly reduced due to a tax benefit recognized under IRS Code Section 199 that included prior years along with an ongoing benefit.", "Turning to earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, mid-teen growth and annual free cash flow in excess of 6 billion. Lastly and before I had the call over to Charlie, I wanted to address the topic of cross-border growth. In my conversations with analysts and investors, there have been a number of questions raised regarding our cross-border volume growth rate. In that light, on a one-time basis, we thought it would be useful to provide some incremental perspective, which we have included on Page 3 of the appendix of our PowerPoint presentation.", "During our earnings report out each quarter, Visa includes in its operational performance package its cross-border volume growth rates on both a nominal and constant basis, excluding Europe. The first two columns show what we have historically reported in the operational performance data pack. The third column is new and represents a global view of Visa including Europe on a nominal basis to facilitate competitive comparisons across a common geographic footprint.", "The next two columns also include Visa Europe and present cross-border growth rates recognizing there are at least two different methods for calculating those growth rates, which can have very different outcomes. When Visa historically measures and reports cross-border growth in constant currency, it uses the year-over-year change in exchange rates for the country currency and which the merchant transaction took place. Those growth rates are presented in the fourth column labeled merchant country.", "Alternatively, one could also calculate cross-border growth rates using the currency representing the country in which the issuer resides. Those cross-border growth rates are presented in the fifth column labeled issuing country. Of course, other factors can also impact growth rates such as relative portfolio exposure to different countries and their currencies, the method for selecting FX rates and translating back to the U.S. dollar and share shifts, but those are much harder to isolate and quantify.", "Recognizing the complexity of this topic, in addition to the one-time slide, we have provided an illustrative example of a cross-border transaction and the effect it can have on growth rates depending on the underlying methodology employed. You will be able to find it on our IR Web site located with the other earnings-related materials and that will be posted at the immediate conclusion of this call. We will then be available for follow-up conversations if you would like further explanation.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Thank you very much, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I thought I\u2019d start with just a couple of brief thoughts on our fiscal fourth quarter. As Byron went through, our performance came in pretty much as we would have expected; adjusted earnings per share growth this quarter of 17% and 19% for the full year.", "As we think about it, it\u2019s actually gratifying given the continued subdued economic environment globally and the volatile geopolitical environment which do affect our business. It says a great deal about the business itself and the company that we\u2019re lucky to be able to be a part of here.", "Revenue growth continued to be constrained by the strong dollar, the low currency volatility compared with historical norms and cross-border growth below historical levels. As Byron mentioned, we believe that these items that have constrained our revenue growth are cyclical and can change very quickly.", "More importantly, we really spend most of our time looking at the underlying fundamentals of the business and they continue to perform very well. In constant dollars, our double-digit payment volume growth with particular strength in the U.S. in addition to double-digit cross-border payment growth.", "Processed transaction growth was strong as well. As Byron mentioned, these trends improved slightly in October through the 21st. Beyond our data through the 21st, our ability to see the future is the same as yours but we\u2019re cautious about the global growth as we plan for next year.", "Just a couple of comments about capital now. We\u2019ve been very consistent as a company in how we think about capital allocation. We continue to believe the highest and best use of our excess capital is to reinvest it both organically and through acquisitions to further our growth. After that, we believe in growing our dividend as our earnings grow and maintaining a payout ratio of about 20% of our trailing earnings. We will opportunistically return the rest of our excess capital through share repurchases.", "In 2014, we did all of these things; investing both organically in the business, outside investments. As Byron mentioned, we effectively bought back 4.6 billion of our stock during the year. And as we look forward, we remain committed to continuing our practices.", "Last week, our Board approved a 20% dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.48 a share per quarter and they also approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program in addition to the roughly 680 million remaining from the prior authorization.", "Given the opportunities in the payment space, we will continue to look for and prioritize growth opportunities, but our Board\u2019s actions should give you an indication of how we feel about our opportunities to grow in the future.", "Let me talk for a second about Russia. Russia continues to move towards its goal of controlling domestic processing. Last Tuesday, President Putin signed modifications to the national payment system law, which positions the Russian Central Bank owned national payment card system as the preferred domestic payment processor. The law delayed the implementation of a guaranteed deposit from the end of October 2014 to March 31, 2015 to allow for an appropriate transition.", "When the national payment card system is utilized, there is no guarantee deposit requirement. We\u2019re working closely with the government and our clients to ensure a smooth transition. We continue to expect to lose a portion of our domestic processing revenues in fiscal 2015 of about $50 million. This is likely to grow up to about $70 million on a full year basis when fully implemented.", "We continue to believe we\u2019ll play an important role in Russia. Once this transition occurs and our baseline is reset, we will continue to focus on helping our clients grow both domestically and internationally. With that, I will talk for a second about our client franchise and just talk about some of our most significant markets, especially some of the things, which do create lumpiness in our incentives as we look forward into 2015.", "First, let me start with Russia. We continue to work with our clients to support their businesses. We recently signed multiyear agreements with several Russia banks including Sberbank, by far the largest issuing bank in Russia. In the United States, we continue to have great success. We renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with the Bank of America, our second largest client globally.", "To put this into perspective, if BofA were a country, it would be one of the largest in the world for Visa. Our agreement provides the opportunity to grow our share from our prior agreement and we\u2019re thrilled with the relationship we have with the Bank of America. Remember, when we signed our 10-year agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase, they agreed to move the majority of their non-Visa volume to Visa.", "These conversions have begun and are going extremely well. Per Nielsen, total expected volume to convert has been estimated at over $40 billion. It\u2019s a bit less than 10 million cards overall and the conversions are expected to be completed by February 2015. In the U.S. credit market, we continue to gain share and remember this is the largest driver of our profit in the world.", "Canada is one of our other large countries. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve signed long-term contracts with issuers and partners representing over 85% of our business including Scotia, CIBC, RBC, TD and Aeroplan. Visa\u2019s Canadian issuers have invested heavily in new rewards programs for Canadian consumers driving very strong growth and we benefit from these great partnerships that we have.", "Brazil is a complicated market for us given the elections and the recently implemented cross-border taxes, but we continue to grow our relationships there as well. We\u2019ve renewed a multiyear credit and debit and commercial agreement with [CAHSA], the fifth largest issuer and we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and prepaid agreement with Banco do Brazil, our largest issuer in Brazil and the Latin American region.", "Just a second on co-brands, which seem to be getting a lot of press these days. First just as a reminder, we think we have the best and we have the largest co-brand platform in the world with seven of the top ten programs exclusively Visa and great partners outside of the U.S. as well. This quarter, we renewed a multiyear credit agreement with Gap.", "We\u2019ll continue to be the payment brand and network for the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy co-brand cards and our partnership with Gap extends beyond the retail store environment. Websites for the Gap and its family brands are now offering Visa Checkout as an online payment service.", "In addition to the deals that we\u2019ve announced today, we\u2019ve agreed to terms to move a significant consumer credit co-brand from a competitor to Visa. We look forward to sharing more about this as cardholder plans take shape. We\u2019ve talked a bunch about bringing new capabilities to market for merchants and in addition to what we are doing in Visa Checkout, we are continuing to start to rollout products for the merchants.", "Last quarter, we forged a proprietary relationship with TrialPay and had a small team from TrialPay join Visa to lead the development of a new product platform designed to help our merchants acquire more customers and sales opportunities. TrialPay is one of the leaders in presenting consumers relevant merchant offers during a transaction and we\u2019re using their technology and experience together with all of the capabilities that exist at Visa to build the platform that will drive millions of new customers to our merchant clients. You\u2019ll be hearing more about this in the coming months.", "We rolled out a new product called Visa Transaction Advisor in August. It\u2019s a new solution, which helps U.S. fuel retailers prevent credit and debit fraud at the pump. This service enables merchants to use real-time authorization risk scores to identify transactions that can involve lost, stolen or counterfeit cards.", "More than 65 million transactions per month are being reviewed by the service at 25,000 locations across the U.S. Some merchants have seen a 23% reduction in fraud at participating locations. Merchants using this service include top U.S. brands such as Shell and Chevron. These are just the beginning of our focus on directing our capabilities towards merchants.", "Just say a few words about payment security and U.S. chip cards. At this point, most people understand most of the benefits that we get from moving from magstripe towards chip-enabled cards, but there are also some important unappreciated benefits just what I want to highlight.", "Approval rates, again this is in the U.S., of chip cards versus magstripe are 97.9% for chip cards versus 92% for magstripe on cross-border and 99.2% for chip cards versus 98.4% in domestic transactions. Today, only 3.6 million terminals at 55,000 locations accept chip cards; 19.8 million Visa cards are in circulation, up 56% from 12.7 million but still a very small number relative to the total cards that are outstanding.", "Having said that, we assume most people have read issuers, acquirers and merchants are working diligently to increase these numbers dramatically. The payment security taskforce that we participate on with a series of other people in the industry put out a press release that said that acquirers representing 80% of U.S. purchased volume estimate that at least 40% of U.S. merchant terminals will be chip-enabled by the end of 2015.", "The group also reported that nine of the country\u2019s largest payment issuers estimated that they would issue more than 575 million chip-enabled cards by the end of 2015. There are also estimates that over 90% of cards will be chip-enabled by the end of 2017.", "Turn for a second and just talk about our digital efforts, which are a huge focus for us inside the company. This quarter, we\u2019ve started to see some tangible progress as we have begun to introduce new digital solutions into the marketplace. First, a reminder that online purchased transactions for us are 19% of our business today and also that in the U.S. online, tablet and mobile purchases are growing at high double digit to triple digit rates versus a face-to-face rate of single digits.", "We are aggressively pursuing this market with the expectation of growing our share. We\u2019ve seen several things to support this; Visa Checkout, Visa Token Services, Visa Digital services and Apple Pay. First, let me talk about Visa Checkout. Remember, this is our solution, which enables you to pay online in a very simple, secure way with a username and password. It\u2019s easy and secure for consumers and it\u2019s a terrific solution for merchants. It\u2019s easy to integrate and it\u2019s been proven that it increases the checkout floor rate for merchants. We continue to make great progress.", "We passed 1.9 million registered users, over 200 financial institutions are partnering with us to roll this out to their clients and merchant reaction has been terrific. Merchants live today include Neiman Markets, Pizza Hut, Staples, 1-800-FLOWERS, Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Lululemon, Petco and Popsugar. Other new merchants who were live include the Gap and its brands, Tory Burch, Gymboree, Crutchfield and Orbitz and more who have signed but have not yet gone live included United, Virgin America and American Apparel.", "Hopefully many of you have seen the advertising both in traditional media as well as digital and social with great partners such as Pizza Hut, Neiman Markets, Newegg and Staples. We intend to win and love the fact that we\u2019re partnering with merchants to drive Visa Checkout as a preferred solution in online commerce. To increase our region scale, we also integrated two partners; 3DCart and ProPay that provide access to a combined total of over 100,000 merchants.", "In addition, our merchant acquired partners such as First Aid and (indiscernible) are integrating Visa Checkout for both their core platform and subsidiaries. As we evaluate our progress, we\u2019re focused on addressable online volume not the number of merchants and are very happy with our progress. To-date, over 33 billion in live addressable volume accepts Visa Checkout, another 30 billion has been signed and we\u2019re very confident that these numbers will be much larger as we get to the end of 2015.", "In early September, we announced the launch of Visa Token Services. We talked about this a bunch, so I won\u2019t dwell on it. But it enables all Visa clients to offer their cardholders a secure and easy way to pay for mobile and online transactions, as well as it enables new forms of payment which are more secure that exist today. Apple Pay is the first used case in the market but many more will follow.", "We\u2019re excited about Apple Pay but for us as we think about what\u2019s going to be coming into the marketplace, it\u2019s only the beginning. We expect a proliferation of exciting mobile and digital solutions leveraging our new capabilities. In October, we launched our sandbox development and testing environment for Visa Digital services as well as updated our SDKs that will enable issuers to begin embedding new forms of contactless payments in their Android applications.", "Eventually, merchants and approved third parties will be able to harness the safety and security of Visa payments to create new proximity payment experiences for their uses. These services will be commercially available in the U.S. in January of 2015. Clients have already begun integrating to our development environment and our building and testing their applications in advance of our full commercial launch in 2015.", "As far as Apple Pay goes, just a couple of quick comments. We\u2019re excited about our participation. We believe it\u2019s good for consumers, it\u2019s good for merchants and it\u2019s good for our industry. Our focus has been on security, scalability and inclusiveness. To the last point, we\u2019re working with over 1,000 financial institutions today and hope to see all of our issuers participate. On Monday, Tim Cook announced that over 1 million cards had been loaded to iPhone 6s in the first 72 hours. Visa represented over 600,000 of those requests; early days but very encouraging. ", "And then just a note for us to be able to deliver all of these differentiated services in the marketplace, we continue to build our engineering and technology capabilities. To that end, we announced that we plan to add a 1,000 technologists and engineers in the U.S. This is in addition to the 1,000 that we\u2019ll be hiring into a new facility in India, which will open in 2015.", "Just to wrap it up before we open it up for questions, let me just say a couple of other things here. There\u2019s been much talk about disruption in payment and what it means for us. Most of the disrupters are great enablers for consumers, merchants and our industry. Apple is the first great example. We and our clients can be great enablers of great consumer and merchant experiences. We bring thousands of banks, millions of customers and a convenience security customer service rewards and other great features that consumers like. You\u2019ll see many other enablers evolve that we will partner with and we\u2019re doing this all in support of our existing clients.", "As we look to the future, we continue to see great growth opportunities for payments. We have our traditional channels and traditional ways of doing business, but we sit here today and we see the mobile opportunities in both the developing, the less developed and the developed world as being great drivers of our mission, P2P, commercial and our merchant relationships as all things that we\u2019re going to focus on to continue to build our business.", "With that operator, I think Byron and I are ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. With regard to client incentives, you talked about those being first half weighted in fiscal '15. Can you talk about how many of your top 10 issuing clients are renewing this year? And do you expect all those renewals to happen in the first half of the year given the frontloading that you talked about earlier?", "Byron Pollitt", "Byron here. So of the top 10, I would say one is scheduled to renew this year. And the frontend loading is really a function of two things and it\u2019s not what you just described. It\u2019s really a function of the deals that we most recently completed. We had a heavy deal flow that came to completion in Q4 and then will begin working their way through the fiscal year '15. But also as we have commented on many times before, incentives can be very lumpy in the way that they unfold. And so in the way that the deals were executed and we expect a frontend loading of incentives with regards to the P&L and then the guidance that we have given on a full year basis fully contemplates the lumpiness, so to speak, and we expect to deliver full year incentives somewhere in the 17.5% to 18.5% range.", "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Charles W. Scharf", "The only thing \u2013 this is Charlie \u2013 that I would just add is that also keep in mind that client contracts sometimes renew off cycle and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance as well.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Craig Maurer - Autonomous Research", "Hi. Thanks. Two questions. First, if you could comment on the apparent announcement out of the Chinese government this morning that they\u2019re going to move to open up that market for additional settlement clearing networks for bank cards? Secondly, a technical question on Apple Pay. We\u2019ve noticed that American Express is able to provide real time transaction alerts whether these are Apple Pay transactions or any other swipe, you\u2019re always getting an alert. On Chase transactions, which you\u2019ve provided a bespoke version of Visa, they don\u2019t seem able to provide this service. It would seem that Chase is not fulfilling the promise of that transaction that you had entered into with them or am I missing something? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Okay, let me do the second part first. So first of all, just to be clear, when you complete an Apple Pay transaction, there is immediate notification on the device itself that shows you that the transaction has taken place, the dollar amount and who the merchant is. You can then effectively flip the card over and see the running tally of all of your transactions. So, there is no \u2013 at least from our experience, my personal experience, there is no lack of clarity whether or not you\u2019ve completed transactions and it is very real time. The question about whether people are then providing additional alerts on top of that, that you got to talk to your individual bank about. We offer a service, which we provide to a series of banks out there that do allow for real-time alerts. I can tell you I personally signed up for it and I get it on as real-time basis as you can expect. But different banks choose what they want their consumer experiences to be. But having said that, again, it exist in real time on the Apple device. As far as China goes, there\u2019s really not a lot more to talk about than what you\u2019ve read, which for those who haven\u2019t read it, there was an announcement today that the Chinese government will open up the market to competition in our business. We don\u2019t know anything specific other than that. We obviously welcome it and we look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace where we believe we can add a lot of value.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, guys. Look, following a year where revenue growth ended up being a little more challenged than expected given some of the cross-border trends being slower, it\u2019s obviously nice to see the end of year pickup in those trends. But I guess following up on the guidance, if you can help us understand the assumptions you\u2019re making around a couple of different attributes includes volume growth versus the way it\u2019s trending in October as well as what part of this is from pricing, just because we\u2019re getting a lot of questions on how much pricing can actually impact the overall top line guidance of low double digits? Thanks, guys.", "Byron Pollitt", "So the headwinds that we had this past year, many of them still continue into this year. Our currency volatility we\u2019ve guided \u2013 we didn\u2019t actually expect to guide to two full percentage points of FX headwind a second year running, but particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past two months has now made that much more likely. We were thrilled to see cross-border beginning to bounce back but it\u2019s too early to call that a trend. With regards to volume, it\u2019s based on low single digit constant dollar growth in volume gains, low double digit. And with regards to pricing, we don\u2019t go in \u2013 it\u2019s not our practice to go into the details of pricing but we have guided that it will take place in Q3 \u2013 beginning of Q3. So this is very much second half weighted and we also indicated in our guidance that we would expect to, with that pricing boost, be in double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year.", "Charles W. Scharf", "Let me just pick up on that. As you\u2019ve heard from both of us, we know what we know. We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. But we look at what\u2019s going on in the world and as we plan the company for next year, we have a cautious point of view of that. And so our cautious point of view suggest that we don\u2019t plan for very big increases in things driven by what\u2019s going on in the outside world. Albeit we know that they will improve at some point. We don\u2019t know when, but we think it\u2019s prudent to plan otherwise.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow back up, Charlie, on your 19% online. I guess it\u2019s volume or revenue, I need to get clarification of that, but the question really is that sounds like that piece of business is growing somewhere around three times faster than what you referred to as the face-to-face business and I\u2019m just wondering if you could give some sort of characteristics around how should we be thinking about revenue yields or all the products that you\u2019re going to be able to put around that type of volume, it sounds like there\u2019s more pricing opportunities in the future with those types of transactions and maybe what we\u2019ve seen on a legacy basis? And then just for level setting, Byron, is it 907 plus the mid teens that\u2019s the guided number or are we adjusting for the second quarter last year benefit? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf", "So on the first piece, what I referenced in my remarks was really to talk about two different things. Number one is we have a big business in the online world today and the way we think about it is we\u2019ve been remarkably successful in a world where we haven\u2019t had great products to compete. We also stand back and we look at the growth and the growth rates of transactions done online, on tablets and on mobile are multiples of what\u2019s done face-to-face. So we both have a defensive reason to do it, but more importantly an offensive reason to help that migration and to participate in it. So the things that we\u2019re doing from Visa Checkout to Apple Pay to the things that are going to be \u2013 using our Token Services and our Digital Solutions are all about having the best products in the marketplace to capture where the growth is, which is in the digital channels. Relative to what it means for us from a pricing perspective, again we\u2019ve been very, very consistent on this which is we\u2019re not sitting here today thinking about this as an opportunity to capture more price. We\u2019re looking at this as an opportunity, one, to both be where the natural growth is but two, to help migrate all those cash transactions whether they\u2019re big value transactions or small value transactions into the electronic space where we\u2019ll hopefully capture more than our fair share. We do have a pricing schedule for our tokenization services. We said we\u2019re waving those fees for a year and we\u2019re going to see how this all plays itself out. But again, we look at this as this is the future of commerce, we want to be there. We see that there will be more volume in that world than there is for us sitting in the world that we are today, and if we make this up on volume as opposed to price that\u2019s just fine with us. If there are pricing opportunities in the future, we won\u2019t look the other way but that\u2019s not our reason to do this.", "Byron Pollitt", "To you second question, Dan, the short answer is 907 and the perspective is you were with us at the very beginning when we did our IPO. From the very beginning part of our investment thesis was that we would manage down the tax rate every single year to the best that we could. We started out at 41%. We said we\u2019d manage it down to below 34%, 35% over about five years. We didn\u2019t stop at five. We have continued to manage our tax rate. We have never adjusted or provided any EPS guidance that adjusted for a full year tax rate, because that\u2019s just one of the levers we have to manage the business and we will continue to do so. So it\u2019s mid teens off of 907.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Don Fandetti - Citigroup", "Yes. Charlie, I was just curious your thoughts on the U.S. market. I mean we\u2019re seeing some of your large bank issuers put up some loan growth. Consumer confidence has picked up, but we\u2019re not really seeing it in the spend. I was just curious on your outlook and just want to confirm that there\u2019s no real improvement baked into guidance in the U.S.?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Byron walked through some of the recent trends. Our performance in the U.S. credit market is strong but we don\u2019t look at it as \u2013 or let me say it differently. Certainly, in a really good performing economy should look much better than it looks today and we\u2019ve not factored that into our thinking for next year.", "Don Fandetti - Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thank you. I got a question on client incentives. Understanding that you guys had a big renewal in 2015, but how should we think about its trajectory looking ahead to 2016 and 2017? Are there large renewals coming up? And then just one clarification on the assumptions embedded in the guidance. Currency volatility as it stands right now, is that a tailwind in 2015 and are you assuming no tailwind? Thank you.", "Charles W. Scharf", "With regards to client incentives, from the beginning we \u2013 in fact going all the way back to the IPO, we have always viewed client incentives on an upward trajectory recognizing that the typical client contract is five years and that when a client contract comes up for renewal and if they have been successful, as most are, nearly all are in growing their portfolios, then the level of incentive adjust to a higher level recognizing the growth over the previous five years or whatever the term was and that\u2019s the way the businesses worked forever. In addition, client incentives were \u2013 back at the IPO we\u2019re much more a developed market phenomena and as the rest of the international group of countries have grown, we have applied client incentives more regularly to those multiyear contracts. And so there\u2019s a natural and healthy and expected upward trajectory in client incentives. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s to the extent that we have one big renewal next year or this fiscal year, that\u2019s not driving it. What\u2019s driving it is what I\u2019ve just described.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "It drives the lumpiness, but not that trajectory.", "Byron Pollitt", "That\u2019s very fair. It drives the lumpiness but not the upward trajectory. And then your \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, your second question was\u2026?", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Currency volatility.", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes, so on currency volatility \u2013 boy, this one\u2019s tough. No one saw last year coming. It was at historically low levels. We\u2019re quite sobered about how to think about that and it would be very consistent for us to say that we have approached currency volatility with a high degree of caution and as Charlie said earlier, we absolutely know what we don\u2019t know about how currency volatility will behave in the future. So, as I said before, we were very pleased to see the September and October bounce. We didn\u2019t see it coming but we\u2019re pleased to see it happened, but we remain very cautious in our guidance with regards to the roll of volatility in the coming year.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stiefel. Your line is now open.", "Christopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to get a little more color, if I could, Charlie, on the pricing you mentioned in April. I think Byron also was saying about cross-border. Is this a similar pricing action to what one of your major competitors did on inbound cross-border? And if it is, does that change your thinking at all on how you wanted to view pricing? And I think we had talked about in the past that this is a situation where you are drawing a line in the sand and saying we\u2019re going to be independent in our pricing decisions and price for value. Just give me a little more color on that. And then a follow-up, if I could on union pay. It seemed like the articles are focused more on clearing rather than the entire food chain in the payments business of authorization and settlement. Can you give us a rough idea how much clearing is of total Visa revenues? Thanks.", "Byron Pollitt", "Why don\u2019t we start with the second one?", "Charles W. Scharf", "The union pay and clearing.", "Byron Pollitt", "Yes.", "Charles W. Scharf", "I don\u2019t have the answer. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 so the way we charge for our services, we charge service fees in data processing. And if we process the transaction then we reap data processing fees and that number is on our income statement and service fees if our brand is on the card. We can\u2019t sit here today and know what China is contemplating when they talk about opening up the marketplace quite frankly. But we really have to wait and see what they say and then understand what it means for us. Beyond that, we really don\u2019t know any more than you know at this time. Then the second one on pricing, why don\u2019t you start on pricing.", "Byron Pollitt", "So on pricing, I can say absolutely this was an independent decision. And as I said in my remarks, it has been four years since we have done something in this arena. Meanwhile, we have continued to invest in the transaction environment related to cross-border and in our domestic markets. And at some point we cross the line and say the value created for both our issuers and our merchants warrant a modest change in pricing which is what we\u2019ve taken.", "Charles W. Scharf", "And we\u2019ve said very consistently and I\u2019ve said it consistently and Byron said it consistently, there is no line in the sand any which way that the decisions are going to stand on their own and we have to look people in the eye and explain why they make sense for us in the environment that we live in and we booked this one for a long time and feel it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "Christopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc.", "Great. Thanks so much for the color.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies & Co. Your line is now open.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks, guys. From what you see in your data, are lower gas prices in the U.S. sparking consumers to spend more actively in other verticals or are the lower gas prices just a drag on volume without any real offset? Because I guess we might have thought that the U.S. volume growth in the September quarter may have accelerated versus June, just given the Chase conversion, but it looks like it was pretty steady. So I\u2019m just wondering if there was a dampening effect from lower gas prices or what you guys are seeing there?", "Charles W. Scharf", "So this is a story that is undoubtedly going to unfold a bit. There is no question that there is a modest drag that we see in the numbers with the drop in gas prices. It\u2019s less than 100 basis points but it\u2019s clear there is a drag. You saw debit growth, which carries a lot of the gasoline transactions. You saw debit growth drop to 7% in the September quarter, you saw it bounce back to 8% through the first 21 days of October. But the data is still a little unclear whether that is spend that\u2019s being redistributed or in the prior year, if you may recall from October 1 through October 16, the government went into a partial shutdown and arguably depressed some spending during that period. And so this particular comp period is not clean. But the thesis that we punch way above our weight when it comes to gasoline prices, use of cards at the pump works on the upside. It also can be a drag on the downside. Then the big question is how is that money redistributed as it frees up, and at this point too early to call.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. It\u2019s Brian from Deutsche Bank. Just looking at the data processing revenues growth at 14% and I think volume at 9%, one of the things that you talked about Byron was the higher U.S. debit fees, some pricing that kicked in. I just want to make sure I understand what that was. It sounded like there was a pricing kick that finally is having an impact in 2012 with three quarters of it still going to have an impact. I just want to make sure I understand what that is. And then finally on the pricing in April 2015, you guys expect \u2013 can you quantify that impact and where it will show up in the P&L? Thanks so much.", "Charles W. Scharf", "With regards to the data processing fees, to be absolutely clear there were no pricing actions in this area. This is about the pricing structure that we implemented back in 2012 and it was a \u2013 as you recall, it was a very different pricing structure than the one that we had previous to that point. And whenever you do that, it\u2019s going to take a couple of years to stabilize as you work your way through the full and complete implementation of that structure. That\u2019s what it is. It involves no price increase or no pricing action. And what I referred to earlier in my script has nothing to do with what you\u2019re seeing. And further this kind of stabilizing should have a positive effect in the next couple of quarters but diminishing and by the end of the fiscal year should be in our view pretty much stabilized. With regards to the other since we\u2019re not yet public on the details of the pricing, we will wait for another day to consider addressing that.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners. Your line is now open.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners", "Thanks for taking my question. Could you address your pricing strategy more broadly over the next two to three years, perhaps gauge your pricing power and to what extent you intend to use it?", "Byron Pollitt", "Sure. I would say there\u2019s nothing new in our thinking which is first of all when we think about our ability to grow the company for the long term, given what the opportunities are for us to grow volume, using pricing to get to numbers that we hope to be able to show over a period of time is not something that we rely on. Having said that, we do think we should be paid fairly for what we do. And to the extent that we look at the services that we provide and feel that there is growing value in what we do, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to consider raising price. We know that people have options and so there has to be reasons to be able to do it whether it\u2019s on the issuer side or on the merchant side. And as I\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019re spending a lot of time working with the merchant community on providing value for them. And as we do that, some of those things will result in things that will help us from a pricing standpoint. Other things support our existing price. So everything we do will be dealt on an individual basis. There is no line in the sand in any way we look at it. But again, as we come into the year and we think about what the opportunities are, pricing is something that we think is tactical for us and not particularly strategic at this point.", "Jack Carsky", "We have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Okay. Our final question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open, sir.", "David Hochstim - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. I wonder \u2013 could you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource? Still pretty good growth in transactions, but the growth rate continues to slow?", "Charles W. Scharf", "Yes. So as we\u2019ve said \u2013 I\u2019d be happy to give you an update. We\u2019re not happy with the update. As you\u2019ve noted, the transaction growth has been slowing and as we\u2019ve said on an earlier occasion, we missed an investment cycle. We are now investing significantly to catch up both in our capabilities and our staff. You should expect the anemic growth, so to speak, to continue for at least another couple of quarters. We expect that that will begin to turn around by the end of this fiscal year. And then just one callout. The measure we give you is transaction growth. The transaction growth that we have lost has been among the least revenue generating of our transaction. So the revenue growth side of the equation has held up much better than the deterioration in transaction. But that said, we\u2019re not happy with the results but we have a very important role for CyberSource to play in our strategies going forward and we are investing aggressively to bring that back to a much stronger growth rate.", "Jack Carsky", "With that, we want to thank everybody for joining us today. And if anybody has follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participation.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Shania. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Visa Inc' s fiscal second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the internet and is accessible on the investor relations section of our website, at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on forms 10-K and Q which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.", "For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC, are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.", "And with that I will now turn the call over to Vasant.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Thank you, Jack. In keeping with prior practice let me begin my remarks by highlighting some key call-outs from the quarter. First, we reported a solid quarter of financial results despite a backdrop of continued domestic and international economic cross currents. Importantly, revenue growth of 8% was a couple of percentage points better than we had expected and telegraphed last quarter. The up side was driven by lower incentive levels than previously assumed and a higher currency volatility benefit. Our flat EPS growth for the period year over year was a direct result of the favorable tax impact we enjoyed in the second quarter of FY '14.", "Second, the overall strengthening of the dollar continued to exert pressure on revenue growth. Exchange rate headwinds this quarter reduced reported revenue growth by approximately two and a half percentage points. We expect dollar strengthening and its associated impacts, to continue for the balance of the year.", "Third, for the second consecutive quarter, our client incentive rate came in below expectations. This was once again due to the timing of certain contractual obligations, as well as moderately lower payouts associated with lower payment volumes in several challenged geographies like Russia and Brazil. We expect line incentives to be higher in the second half of the year.", "Fourth, our effective tax rate was 32% in the second quarter, 10 points higher than Q2 last year, when we recorded an IRS section 199 tax benefit related to multiple years. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter this year, as I will discuss later.", "Overall, the underlying drivers of our business remain stable and healthy, as evidenced by payment volumes and transactions growth. However, the strong dollar impacts us negatively this year not only on currency translation, but also in our cross-border business. Despite these headwinds, we're maintaining our outlook for the year in line with guidance previously provided.", "There are, however, some significant shifts from quarter to quarter which we want to make sure are clear to you all. First, on the revenue front, after a better than expected second quarter, we now project the third quarter to represent the low point of growth for the year at 6% to 7% on a nominal basis. Growth will pick up again and approach double digits in Q4.", "The third quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by higher client incentives, some are shifting from the second quarter, the continuing drag from lower gasoline prices and tougher comparisons in the other revenue line which benefited last year from revenues associated with our FIFA World Cup sponsorship. The full benefit of price increases and the smaller incentive drag due in part to the lapping of a deal intensive quarter in FY '14 will help Q4 revenue growth.", "Second on the expense front, we expect a meaningful step-up in expense growth in the third quarter, as a number of programs including marketing and certain technology initiatives have been phased to the back half of the year. As always, we will continue to carefully monitor the economic backdrop and can and will make expense adjustments as necessary. Our full year expense growth expectations remain unchanged at this time.", "Third, we expect a higher tax rate in the third quarter, followed by a substantially lower tax rate in the fourth quarter. Our estimated tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be as much as 200 basis points higher than the rate in the second quarter. However, as currently anticipated, we expect to take advantage of certain tax benefits as early as the fiscal fourth quarter which would drive an effective tax rate in the low 20%'s in Q4 and no change to our full year fiscal tax rate expectation of the low 30%'s.", "When you put this all together, we're now looking at third quarter fully diluted EPS being $0.06 to $0.08 lower than analyst's current expectations. For the year, we now expect our fully diluted earnings per share growth to be at the low end of the mid-teens range, in line with current analyst expectations.", "Moving on to second quarter business drivers and our financial results, I will start with global payments volume and process transaction trends. Global payments volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the prior quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and international grew 13%, both at similar levels to the December ending quarter. Drilling down further, in the March quarter, U.S. credit grew 12%, a two percentage point moderation compared to the December quarter.", "The account conversion is complete and consistent with last quarter, contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our overall credit growth in the period. This positive impact will continue for the next two quarters, though at a declining rate before lapping. Lower gasoline prices, the full effect of which hit payments volumes this quarter reduced credit volume growth by two points. As such, gasoline prices appear to be the primary driver of the step-down in credit growth. U.S. debit grew at 6% in the March quarter, generally in line with the December quarter. Lower gasoline prices had an outsized effect on debit growth, reducing it by approximately three percentage points.", "In aggregate, lower gasoline prices impacted U.S. payments volumes by a negative three points in the quarter. A portion of the savings from gasoline price declines is being spent in other categories, primarily grocery and restaurant segments. This is evident in debit payment volumes, not yet in credit payment volumes. More recently, through April 28th, U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, with U.S. credit growing 12% and debit 6%, essentially unchanged from Q2 trends.", "Global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant volume growth rate in the March quarter, unchanged from the December quarter. The U.S. grew 6% and international grew 10% in constant dollars. The further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year continues to have a negative impact on cross-border commerce. Forward currency curves imply that the dollar will gain in strength. If this materializes, these cross-border trends are likely to persist and perhaps worsen.", "Through April 28th, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 9%, with a U.S. growth rate of 6% and an international growth rate of 10% generally in line with the second quarter rate. As you can see, when you adjust for the dollar, the underlying drivers of our business have remained very stable in aggregate.", "However, the significant currency moves we've experienced this year are impacting cross-border commerce in a variety of ways, with the largest impacts coming from the U.S. dollar. Overall, cross-border volume growth has remained suppressed from historical levels.", "As may be expected, outbound cross-border commerce from weakening currencies like the Euro, Ruble and the Canadian dollar has been slowing. Hardest hit corridors were Russian card holder spending across Europe and the Middle East and Canadian and EU card holder spending in the U.S. Offsetting this to some extent is accelerating cross-border commerce of the strong currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.", "In Q2 we saw U.S. card holder spend stepping up in Europe and Latin America. Chinese travel across the world continues to be robust. And cross-border spend out of Latin America is also picking up, helped by easier year to year comparisons. Currency shifts will remain a critical variable to watch as the year progresses. Any moderation of dollar strength will help our business and vice versa. Any pickup in economies like Europe, Brazil and Russia would be welcome.", "Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 17 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period which was a one point improvement from Q1. The U.S. grew 9%, while international delivered 14% growth. Transaction growth in the U.S. is helped by some spending shift from gas to lower ticket categories of spend like QSR's.", "Through April 28th process transaction growth was 10%, with a U.S. growth rate of 8% and an international growth rate of 14%. Transactions grew 14% in the period, as our reboot of the business continues to pay off. CyberSource will celebrate its five-year anniversary as a part of Visa this year and we have completed the integration of this business into our global merchant services and solutions functional area.", "With the integration complete and since CyberSource transactions do not represent a material component of Visa's business, we will no longer call out this data separately after this quarter.", "Turning now to our Q2 reported financials, net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.4 billion, an 8% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by solid growth globally across all revenue categories and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by approximately two and a half points by the strong U.S. dollar. Solid global payments growth volume drove service revenue up $1.6 billion, up 8% over the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, underlying payments volume growth in local currencies remains very healthy.", "Data processing revenue at $1.3 billion was 9% over prior year's quarter, based on continued strong growth rates in Visa processed transactions, both in the U.S. and internationally. As mentioned, transaction growth in the U.S. was helped by some gasoline related savings being spent on lower ticket size transactions, such as QSR's.", "International transaction revenue was up 11% to $964 million, with higher currency volatility countering impacts from moderating cross-border payment volumes and currency translation. As we measure our key currencies, volatility was at five-year highs in Q2, meaningfully contributing to international revenues.", "Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, with moderate higher personnel, depreciation and G&A costs, offset by lower marketing and network and processing expenses. Higher personnel costs are primarily the result of higher headcount, reflective of our strategy to invest for future growth. The uptick in G&A was primarily the result of a loss related to our debit processing business in Asia which we sold during the period.", "Higher depreciation was a result of ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Offsetting these were lower marking expenses, due to the absence of the winter Olympics and FIFA World Cup spend in the prior year, as well as shifts in current programs to the second half of the fiscal year. As mentioned earlier, this will result in a step-up in expense growth for the balance of the fiscal year.", "Our operating margin was 67% for the second quarter, in line with our annual guidance of mid-60s. Capital expenditures were $98 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, adjusting for our recent stock split, we had 2.45 billion shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 2.46 billion.", "On a split adjusted basis, we repurchased a total of 16.2 million shares during the March quarter, at an average price per share of just under $65 per share. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 28.6 million shares at a price of just under $65 per share, for a total of $1.9 billion. We currently have authorization to buy up to $3.8 billion of stock.", "Since the IPO, Visa has add clear capital allocation strategy of investing cash to grow our business organically and through acquisitions as job number one, then returning excess cash to shareholders through stock buy-backs and dividends. Our dividend policy remains unchanged and our Board recently declared a $0.12 quarterly dividend per split-adjusted share.", "For the past seven years, Visa has had a consistent approach to stock buybacks with the pace being modulated to some extent from quarter to quarter by valuation considerations. This approach to buybacks will continue, as evidenced by our purchases year to date. This is a growth business that generates significant cash flow and a low base of stock. A systematic buyback using excess cash after capital investments and dividends is a strategy we have been and will remain committed to.", "In summary, the underlying drivers of our business remain robust. The strong dollar and other large currency moves have created some headwinds this year, as have the sharp decline in gas prices. These are the normal fluctuations one expects in the course of business.", "The very attractive long term secular growth trends in our business remain intact. Despite the headwinds this year, our results are on track so far and we're comfortable reaffirming the guidance we provided to you at the start of our FY '15.", "To conclude, this is my first earnings call as CFO of Visa. I'm delighted to be part of Charlie's team.", "I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming days and weeks and with that, I will turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charlie Scharf", "Thank you very much, Vasant. An official public welcome from all of us. First of all, let me start with commenting that we're very pleased with the quarterly results. We think of them as solid and consistent and certainly gratifying in the face of some of the more challenging economic conditions and geopolitical concerns that we see around the world.", "Net revenue grew 9% nominally. FX impact hurt growth by two and a half points. Operating income growth of 11%, payments volume increased 11% on a constant dollar basis and cross-border volume growing at 8% on constant dollar basis, are all very solid numbers.", "We see very little change in the overall global economy, with some exceptions and we see more short-term risk than we see up side. Consumer spend in the U.S. specifically continues at reasonable levels but is not accelerating. Gasoline prices continue to negatively impact both credit and debit. Outside the U.S., we see continued weakness in Russia and Brazil, but we do see strength in China and our Middle East and North Africa region.", "And the effect of the strong U.S. dollar, as Vasant pointed out, is meaningful. We see this through the FX translation impact, but additionally, the benefit of that we see of U.S. spenders outside of the U.S. is outweighed by the negative impact on the non-U.S. spenders spending less in the United States.", "Away from the economic growth environment, we continue to feel terrific about our activities to drive growth which I will talk more about. We continue to make excellent progress on our evolving technology initiatives which include everything we're doing in the digital space, mobile specifically, Visa Checkout and the work we're doing in our global merchant services and solutions groups. We continue to have a strong flow of significant client wins and renewals.", "I will speak a little more on several of these points in a moment, but in sum, while we remain appropriately cautious in the short-term, we remain quite bullish on the medium to long term and continue to believe there are tremendous opportunities for years to come. Let me just amplify some of the comments that Vasant made regarding payment volume for a second.", "First, the negative impact of gasoline on our U.S. payment volume is significant, at three percentage points. Though the initial impact on payment volumes was felt in our first quarter, the full impact did not hit until the second quarter and so the revenue impact will not be fully felt until our third quarter, because of the quarter lag on service revenues. In an update to our March quarter, Visa Insight Survey, things haven't changed much with consumers. About 30% tell us they're spending more in other categories, up from 25% last quarter.", "The two categories that continue to stand out are the lower ticket categories, groceries and quick service restaurants. As I said last quarter, the lag time between lower prices and spending we think is about six to nine months, as consumers accumulate enough to feel comfortable making larger purchases. Keep in mind, consumer confidence and confidence in sustained lower gas prices will impact their willingness to spend.", "Cross-border volume remains steady at 8% in the quarter, as we said. And as I have mentioned and Vasant mentioned, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar against certain global currencies is negatively influencing cross-border spend and ultimately revenue growth. The U.S. cardholders are spending more outside the U.S. as a result of the stronger dollar, resulting in higher transaction and payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis at international merchants.", "However, given currency translations and generally lower acquiring fees in foreign countries, that volume is not as lucrative as what we would have enjoyed on an inbound basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has hurt in-bound spend to the U.S., primarily from the Canadian, European, Brazilian and Japanese corridors. As Vasant mentioned, higher currency volatility has offset some of this.", "Let me just turn now and talk about some important client activity. Starting with the U.S., we renewed a multi-year credit issue agreement with U.S. Bank, a great partner and one of our leading issuers and the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States. U.S. bank has been a long time Visa partner and we lack further to building further upon the exciting things we've done with them, in terms of innovation, new product development and security.", "In the U.S. co-brand space, Best Buy, the world's largest retailer, will convert their consumer credit card portfolio to Visa later this summer. We also renewed a multi-year credit agreement with BP. BP has been a longtime Visa partner and launched its first co-brand in 2006.", "We're thrilled with our new agreement with Costco. We're very pleased to have been selected to replace American Express as the credit card network for its U.S. warehouse clubs and gasoline locations, beginning April 2016. A strategic benefit for all Visa issuers and their cardholders. We're also excited to be partnering with Citi on the new Costco Visa co-brand credit card. We view Costco as truly unique opportunity and very strategic.", "As I said, it is good for Visa, but an even bigger benefit for all of our clients. They're one of the largest and best retailers in the world. The third largest merchant in the U.S. according to the national retail federation, someone who historically did not accept our credit product and we now have an opportunity to gain acceptance where MasterCard and American Express are not accepted in the credit space. We also love that this is a truly long term acceptant [Technical Difficulty] and co-brand partnership.", "For all of our clients and their consumer and business clients, it will be the first time in 16 years they gain access to the tens and tens of billions of dollars of annual credit payments volume that heretofore went to American Express.", "It is a great opportunity to drive incremental usage. It should help all Visa issuers drive their cards towards the top of the wallet and increase new account and card holder acquisition opportunities. This was a very competitive process and there has been much discussion of what drove the outcome here.", "I don't want to speak for Costco, but let me say that I have not met a retailer that cares more for their clients, their members more. Going forward, Costco will be entrusting their clients, their members, these precious relationships to Visa. If it were me, money wouldn't win the day. The best brand with the best capabilities would win. I've consistently said price matters, but cannot win the strategic relationship. So our strategy is not to be the low-cost provider.", "As I think about what drove the decision here, I look at a series of things, including a view that we're the premier brand for Costco members, the belief that our brand will help Costco grow more than all the others, clear, strong brand preference among their members and target market, specifically with the higher growth affluent and millennial holders which in this case will drive membership and sales growth directly for Costco. Our broad global acceptance, our superior data and analytics capabilities and our leadership on innovation.", "I would also point out that we feel that all the benefits I've outlined, plus what our issuers bring to the table, can create more value than others. Specifically and quite simply, we, our issuing partner and the co-brand can make more and provide greater value to our clients than smaller, closed loop networks. As a remainder, the implementation of these agreements is subject to the purchase of the existing co-brand credit portfolio by Citi.", "Turning to our business outside the U.S., let me first start with China. Before I turn to market opening which I know is a topic that you all want to hear about, I want to talk for a second about our existing business. It is doing extremely well. We have a significant and fast growing business, with relationships that have been growing and deepening.", "We're the market share leader versus non-Chinese providers and that share has been steady since 2013. We continue to sign contracts and be awarded new issuant business from Chinese Banks. As examples, this quarter we renewed and expanded our agreement with China Civic Bank, one of the largest partners in China. The program will now include issuance of Visa only branded companion cards, in addition to the dual branded program in place. China Everbright Bank, one of China's largest financial institutions renewed their credit agreement with Vise.", "Regarding the market opening news, clearly this is a significant and positive step. The facts as we've read them thus far are consistent with our expectations and we're very excited to see more specifics which obviously will be important. We do intend to apply for a license.", "As I've said, we have a strong business today with great local relationships which have only become stronger over the past several years. We're excited to participate in one of the most important markets in the world. And for Visa to help in the growth of domestic Chinese marketplace, working with Chinese companies and the Chinese government.", "To be clear, we're not pursuing this for the short-term profit opportunity. This is a long term commitment which will pay off over the long term. We intend to prove our value as a partner within China, so bringing our value added capabilities to help grow the Chinese economy will come before our revenue and profit growth for quite some time. Regardless of when we start to participate domestically in China, we do not expect this to be a meaningful contributor to our financial results for many years to come.", "Turning away from China, First-Ran Bank, a large issue in South Africa and our largest issuer in sub-Saharan Africa, extended their contract with Visa. We also renewed our partnership with Desjardins, the leading financial group in Canada and the fourth largest cooperative financial group in the world and lastly Banorte, one of Mexico's oldest and largest national institutions, renewed their credit agreement with Visa. On the other side of the equation, Citibank and Itau will be moving their business away from Visa. In certain regions around the world, we have contacts with Citi which will continue to run for quite some time. In terms of how quickly these conversions commence and ultimately how long it takes has not been made clear to us and we will let you know as we learn more.", "While losing any business is disappointing to us, we know that we're not going to win everything, as we operate in a very competitive environment. We've always been very thoughtful and strategic about choosing for which clients we want to be aggressive in this competitive process and we feel great about our portfolio of client relationships. Importantly to us, we remain disciplined in our approach to negotiations and the net of these recent wins and losses leaves Visa and our partners in a better strategic position for the long term than would have otherwise been the case.", "A couple of other quick updates on the regulatory and legal fronts. First of all, in Russia, we have been actively working with the national payment card system and central bank to achieve full migration of Russian domestic Visa transactions with minimal disruptions. All domestic Visa transactions will continue to be processed in accordance with the national payment system law.", "And in the U.S., on the merchant litigation case, we continue to make good progress in settling the opt-out cases. Fiscal year to date, we've paid out $321 million and additional settlements are progressing nicely.", "And we continue to lead the world to the world of digital commerce. Visa Checkout continues to make great strides. We now have 260 financial institution partners and 140 merchants live globally. To date we have over 4 million registered users, over $46 billion in total addressable volume accepts Visa Checkout and we continue to add merchants, including small and medium size retailers, where our acquiring partners are helping us grow acceptance.", "We're also deploying Visa Checkout outside of the U.S.. As an example, we launched Visa checkout in China at the end of March, China Merchant Bank is the first institution in China to introduce Visa checkout to its customers. In the coming months, we're working with other Chinese institutions to deploy checkout.", "In April, we kicked off consumer marketing campaigns in both Australia and Canada, in partnership with some of the biggest merchants in those regions. We're on track to be live in a total of 16 markets this year. ComScore conducted a study last month to evaluate our progress with merchants since launching Visa Checkout last July. The findings are very clear.", "Visa Checkout customers convert to buyers 69% of the time. This is 66% higher than conversion rates reported with traditional on-line checkout. The product is doing exactly what we said it would do, solving the on-line friction problem at a rate that's higher than the competitive solutions we surveyed.", "In the digital solutions space, a few comments. In my time here at Visa, it is amazing the amount of companies that are working and talking about the future of payments in the role, some very young, some very established. Regardless of tenure, it's clear to me that they fall to two categories. Those that talk about being innovative and those that are actually driving innovation in way that truly drives incremental value and can scale.", "I'm proud of the work of the Visa team and proud to be leading the industry into this digital world. When we launched tokenization, we told you it was more than a set of just security standards. We said it was a platform to enable new commerce experiences, then came Apple Pay.", "When we participated in the Apple Pay launch, we said it was just the beginning and there would be more solutions that leverage our digital platforms. Since then, Samsung has announced the new Galaxy S6 payments experience and Google's Android operating system supporting host card emulation. And we have several clients developing new HCE based applications in our sandbox as we speak.", "As the industry leader, a Visa partnership gives the chance for these experiences to be successful because of our technology, our scale and our leadership. Our innovation is not something every consumer sees, but it is the things that we do as a platform that others can build upon and it is our platform that becomes embedded in all sorts of devices, operating systems and mobile apps.", "Essentially we're enabling our partners to take advantage of one common payment platform and set of standards, but still able to customize their solutions to their specific client needs appropriate to their markets, with their preferred user experiences. Great companies come to Visa first because they know we understand the technology of payments better than anyone else and we understand the needs of their users.", "And we continue to build out our capabilities to support our merchant partners. We completed our acquisition of TrialPay this quarter. It is a platform that we've worked with before and one that proved its value proposition before we decided to acquire the company. Combined with our broader merchant capabilities across Visa Analytics, Loyalty Products and VisaNet capabilities, this is a platform that we intend to use to help merchants improve their marketing and thereby drive their incremental sales.", "During the last six months, we introduced to the market three new products and solutions specifically designed to help our merchant partners. First, we created a customer intelligence dashboard, a custom analytic dashboard for merchants to enable them to understand who is shopping with them at the store level.", "We're helping merchants not only understand the sales trends, but also who is shopping, their demographics, where they live, where else they shop, et cetera. The platform is helping our gasoline merchants better predict demand, airlines to optimize routes and load factors and many others to optimize marketing campaigns.", "The second solution is a digital marketing measurement product. Earlier this year, we launched a new platform which enables our merchant clients to measure their digital market spend with an entirely new level of accuracy. When a merchant runs a digital campaign, we're able to show them in real time how many of those impressions led to specific sales using a Visa card. For many years merchants have taken a big leap of faith that clicks led to real sales. For the first time ever, we're now helping them measure the actual sales.", "The final example is a pilot program but one that we're excited about. Platform that actually drives new customers into our client's store. The platform is powered by Trial Pay, where we place targeted merchant offers on the web and on mobile apps.", "For example, you're checking into a flight, you will see an offer to get 500 miles if you shop at Pete's coffee in the next week. When the customer comes in to buy their coffee, they're notified in real time that they've received their bonus. Miles, in this case.", "Also we track the purchases and show the merchant in real time how many of the customers are coming into which specific stores. Early days, but client interest remains very strong. As you can see, these are products which we believe over a period of time changes our dialogue with merchants as we help them grow their business.", "So just to wrap up, we're very pleased with our performance for the first half of the fiscal year, especially in light of some of the challenging aspects of the economic environment. It continues to be a very exciting time in payments, as you can tell from all the recent announcements. We remain bullish on our future and we continue to broaden and deepen our work relationships with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and other third parties.", "With that, Vasant and I will be pleased to take your questions.", "Jack Carsky", "Okay, Shania, we're ready for the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Darrin Peller", "Just trying to square a little more of the discussion on EPS growth being at the low end of the mid-teens guidance range, given your unchanged revenue growth guidance. Was it primarily tax rate assumptions in the second half of the year?", "And then just to further add to that, are you incorporating further volatility benefits, FX volatility benefits in your outlook and guidance? Because it clearly helped your cross-border revenue growth this quarter. Thanks, guys.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Darrin, just a couple of things. I think the two things you should take away from what we said was there's a certain amount of moving around going on between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We said that the revenue growth in the third quarter will be the low point of the year in terms of growth and then it will pick up in the fourth quarter, approaching double digits. So that's one thing.", "The second is expense growth will step up a bit in the third quarter. Still in the mid-single digits level for the full year, but step up in the third quarter as some expense is shifting between the first half and the second half in marketing and technology.", "And then if you look at our personnel expenses, you should be looking more at what the first quarter level was and a little bit of growth with some of the initiatives we have underway. And the last piece that shifts things, mostly between the third and the fourth quarter, was the tax rate. The main take away from all this is, as we said, $0.06 to $0.08 shift out of the third quarter. For the full year all we're saying is we still feel good about the range we provided, but we're at the lower end of the range. Really in line with where the street is right now.", "Your other component of the question was currency volatility. We did tell you that it was at five-year highs in the second quarter. So in terms of what we're expecting going forward, as you know, we benefit when there's volatility because FX spreads widen. It does offset a little bit the translation impact of currencies. We're not assuming they stay at five-year highs. We're assuming that there's some amount of regression to the mean, but we're not assuming they go to the kinds of lows we saw last year.", "So it's anybody's guess really. So we're just assuming that it's not going to stay at this level, but nor is it going to be as calm as it was last year.", "Operator", "Next question is Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Could you talk a little bit about how you will be trying to protect the volume from Costco, together with Citi, from American Express trying to win it back? And maybe just as a corollary, talk a little bit about your thoughts about what's going to happen when existing co-brands come up for renewal and the competitive environment, there?", "Charlie Scharf", "Let me take the second one first. Co-brands are in the market certainly all the time. It's been a competitive marketplace. And all the things that I talked about in terms of the advantages that we think we brought to Costco, we think we can provide to almost all co-brand partners out there. In this case, it's certainly helpful to be the incumbent and the leader in the space. We've got deep relationships with the largest co-brand providers, certainly here in the United States and others across the world.", "And those relationships, where we believe if you treat the partner properly, you prove to them over a period of time you help them grow, there's got to be a reason for them to want to do something else, other than be with you. And so we feel very good about our positioning there.", "On the Costco front, I think when you take a look at what we bring to equation, you can assume that Costco, who's got the most to lose in this, has thought an awful lot about what risks they have and what opportunities they have. And the reason for them to want to go and take the risk of moving the portfolio is because they think there's more upside doing business with us and Citi in this case.", "And when we think about and they think about the brand preference that their customers have, as I said in my remarks, the things that specifically the affluent and millennials think about our brand versus the competing brands out there, we're very confident that we'll be able to do a better job for Costco than the incumbent. And that will start day one, as we work extremely closely with Citi and Costco and that work has begun already.", "Operator", "Next is Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg", "So can you just confirm whether or not some of your planned pricing actions for April got implemented as expected? And then can you also just clarify related to Costco, do the incentives there hit in FY '15 or in FY '16, when the contract actually begins?", "Charlie Scharf", "So Costco will be 2016.", "Vasant Prabhu", "And the pricing is in. Just to clarify, the pricing -- there were two changes, both of which happened in April. The first was U.S. acquirer service fees on all credit products and the second was U.S. acquirer international service assessments. They went in roughly around the same time, but the impacts are somewhat different.", "One of them hits a little earlier in terms of impacts on our financials, the other a little later. So we get the full benefit of the pricing in the fourth quarter. We get a little less of a benefit in the third quarter. It's really a small difference.", "Operator", "Yes, Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "I guess I have a follow-up question to the Costco. Charlie, you mentioned it's been competitive in co-brand, but is it from an economic standpoint incrementally more competitive and does that then play out further as you renew some of the other co-brands down the line? I guess secondly, how confident are you that Citi will be able to secure the portfolio from American Express? Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "So when you say is it economically more competitive--", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Is it getting progressively more competitive, meaning are the economics materially different than they were before?", "Charlie Scharf", "First let's talk Costco for a second, then we'll talk more broadly about co-brands. And I tried to make this point clearly. So, let me just make sure that I'm even clearer on it. We view Costco as something extremely unique.", "And so this is an industry where it's amazing, the gossip. And I don't know whether it's the consultants or what it is, but everyone likes to go around and talk about everything that's happening in terms of pricing and who did what to whom on this. What I would tell you is what we and my guess is issuers were willing to do for Costco is very specific to a unique opportunity to gain the kind of credit acceptance that we've talked about and the kind of co-brand that we've talked about, for a partner now that didn't accept our products in the past of this size.", "We view it as a unique opportunity to capture that volume and then to use the ability to have that acceptance to grow our products elsewhere, regardless of whether they're co-brand or not co-brand, but obviously the co-brand here will bring with it extraordinary benefits. So Costco to us stands on its own, in terms of the way we think economically about what we should be willing to do.", "In terms of whether the co-brand space is getting more competitive economically, I'm not sure. It's very, very competitive, as is the issuing business. And I think when people lose relationships like this, they need to figure out where they're going to look and so we assume that they'll continue to be competitive. As we think about our future and we think about our ability to continue to deliver the kind of growth that I think you are all expecting from us, we factor that into our assumptions along the way.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Okay. And just the Citi portfolio? AMEX's sales to Citi of the existing portfolio.", "Charlie Scharf", "Everything that we hear suggests confidence, but we're not a party to it.", "Operator", "Next is Bill Carcache of Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Apologies for another Costco question, but was wondering if you could speak to whether any of your issuing bank partners have expressed any sort of concern about the interchange rate at which the Costco volume will be coming over? Just in the sense that it could be difficult for them to offer rewards on the Costco spend. Just curious if you think that could be an issue?", "Charlie Scharf", "Well, I guess I would start with, there were a lot of -- there were more issuers than Citi who wanted to win the co-brand. And so whoever certainly was involved in the process understands the competitive dynamic and what would exist.", "And again, I think from our perspective, the conversation is exactly what I've said here. It's a unique and strategic opportunity to get access to an extraordinary amount of volume that we and our clients weren't going to have access to and if you think about if we didn't win, the kind of conversation that we were going to have and the kind of conversation we would have to have with our issuers and their clients about not being able to participate in the opening of one of potentially the biggest retailers in the world, is not a conversation that we would have relished.", "So we feel very good about what we've done here. When we make decisions that affect our clients, we take them extraordinarily seriously and understand that they will look at those decisions in the context with everything else that we do for them and we feel good about what where we've come out and are confident that it's a benefit for them.", "Operator", "Next Craig Maurer of Autonomous.", "Craig Maurer", "Question on Brazil, the Itau loss, from what we understand that will be fairly material as a percentage of that business. And with ELO creeping into the market as well, are you concerned at all about Visa's historic market share in Brazil shrinking significantly? And following up on your comment on a Mexican win, do you have any greater visibility on when that market will open for Visa processing? Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "Let me do the first one and then, Jack, you need to remind me about the second question. So in Brazil, listen, losses are losses. You know, I would just make it clear that these types of decisions aren't generally decisions that people make without talking to a series of people. So we were certainly involved in a series of conversations. And again, everyone makes their decisions in terms of what they're willing to do and at what price they're willing to do it at.", "And when a large issuer says that they're going to move volume away from you, it's going to be hard for us to make that volume up elsewhere. And that's a decision that we chose to make to some extent relative to how aggressive we were willing to be relative to pricing. Because we, as I said in my remarks, it's important for us not just to win volume, not just willing to win incremental revenue, but do it in a way which is smart for us and for the payments industry for the long term.", "And ELO is -- it is a fact. It is what it is. It's a different kind of network with different kind of capabilities targeted, for the most part, at different types of consumers than we generally target our business. And I'll tell you that I feel great about the relationships that we have with the other large issuers in Brazil and think we have the opportunity to continue taking share from them, albeit that share won't we place what we'll lose from Itau.", "Jack Carsky", "Mexico processing.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yes, Mexico. There is no timetable. We're actively working on some things, there, where we think that we can prove to the issuers that by us processing, it actually becomes a benefit for them and there's nothing imminent there, but it will evolve over time.", "Operator", "Next is Dan Perlin of RBC.", "Dan Perlin", "My question is basically this, the step-up in expense growth occurring at the same time that your inventive fees are kind of suggesting that they're also stepping up -- I guess it's two things. One is, kind of alludes to the fact that you obviously see something on the horizon, maybe it's second half of this year or early into next and I would like to get some color on that? Why you had pulled the trigger on both at the same time? Secondly, why the incentive fee slip? Why did the client take so long to convert? What were those conversations like and why are they not taking place?", "Charlie Scharf", "Let me do the first one first. The first, they are unrelated. There's nothing that we see on the horizon or anything like that. As we said, incentives -- I've been here two-and-a-half years and it seems to me that we talk about this every single quarter which is we do our best to provide insight and we certainly do it for our own planning as to what incentives are going to be, quarter by quarter. But we don't have a lot of control over it.", "It's hard to know exactly when negotiations will become finalized, contracts will close and it changes the level of incentives. So as we've talked about multiple times, it is the full year that we really think about as something that we feel much better about than quarter to quarter.", "And on the one hand, we'd love to have things close sooner. It's not something we try and delay, but it happens in the normal course of business. And on the marketing side, there it just relates to some specific things that we're going to be doing in the second half of the year that really relate to the summertime, coming out of the summer into pre-school and then eventually leading into the holiday season. That relates to how we want to time our marketing spend.", "Vasant Prabhu", "I just want to highlight that we're not changing anything in terms of our full year expectations on expense growth. So there's really no change. So it's not like we pulled the trigger to do something different in the third or fourth quarter.", "As Charlie said, there are some marketing programs, particularly as it relates to Visa Checkout, that we think we can get a lot of traction doing in the back-to-school period. That's money that has been coordinated with merchants and things like that, that this is the best time to spend it.", "There are some regional marketing programs that are happening in the second half. There's some technology initiatives that are ramping up that may have been a little slower to start than we might have expected earlier, but are ramping up into the year, but it was all expect. And then in terms of the personnel expenses, there's a reasonable predictability in that, it fluctuates from quarter to quarter, sometimes there's some noise, small items here and there.", "But if you look at our first quarter run rate and you assume there's a certain amount of growth with some of the initiatives we have, all in all, I guess the short answer is -- we're not doing anything specific to ramp up the expense growth and our full year expectation does not change. And as we said in our remarks, if the world changes, we're ready to take a hard look at what remains to be spent and decide whether it needs to be spent.", "Operator", "It's James Friedman of Susquehanna.", "James Friedman", "I wanted to ask about commercial. Charlie, any perspective about how you are doing on the commercial side? One of your competitors had called out some weakness on the commercial side, at least in North America in the calendar first quarter. Do you think that you're taking share and how are you competing in the commercial market?", "Vasant Prabhu", "Setting aside the share question, commercial payments growth for us in the second quarter was quite healthy at 10%; it's performing well. A lot of interest from non-financial institutions, participants to provide value added services. So there's a lot of non-traditional people coming in, like technology providers, healthcare entities and so on. I don't know if Charlie --", "Charlie Scharf", "The only thing, commercial -- we all talk about commercial, across all of the different people that participate in this business, as one of the great opportunities. I mean, the two really meaningful opportunities that the industry has that are really meaningful, apart from just the business as we know it, is P2P and commercial. There are large, large sums of money that -- on the commercial space, specifically, we compete in. We've worked really hard on our products, we're doing fine in it.", "I really don't know about share. It's hard to know about it. But I think the 10% growth has the opportunity to be much, much larger. And that's something that we're working through and hopefully in the coming quarters, we'll have more to talk about specifically about what we're doing there. But it's an important business for us today. And the question is whether or not we can crack a nut and incrementally move it from the something which is incremental to which is more of a step function.", "Operator", "Next is Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "Jim Schneider", "Charlie, relative to the China opportunity, I realize that there's a lot of unwritten rules at this point and there's a lot of things still in the air, but can you maybe talk about your operational readiness from a network perspective to enter China and what you need to get to a level of full functionality, there and kind of the game plan on that front?", "Charlie Scharf", "Yes. Again, I would say, the devil is going to be in the details in terms of the way the rules are written. I would say it's been our expectation -- well, let me back up. What I said in the remarks is that there was -- what has been said has been what we've expected. And so you should assume that we've been planning for that and working towards that. There are different time periods that are laid out in terms of what the state counsel announced, relative to when things would have to be ready and we have teams of people around the company that are working to be prepared to enter as soon as we possibly can.", "Operator", "David Hochstim of Buckingham.", "David Hochstim", "I wonder, could you just go back to the international transaction revenue growth and help us understand how much of the change really was attributable to -- what the change is attributable to the increase in FX volatility? Because the gap might be even bigger next quarter and do you have a currency adjusted growth rate that would help us get back to that? And I guess also there's mix differences because of changes in cross-border spending?", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yes, I think you should look at -- there are three things going on in that international transactions line. One is, of course, all those transactions are in various currencies, so there is clearly an FX translation impact which is largely negative.", "The second is the things we talked about which is that strong currency markets have outbound commerce that's improving, but the purchasing power of the currency is greater. So that you don't get the full volume benefit even though transactions are growing and then in weak currency markets you've got inbound -- you've got declining outbound commerce and a weaker currency. The net effect of all this is also negative.", "Offsetting that, certainly we've benefited from volatility. I don't think we really ever publicly quantified those kinds of benefits. They move around. But clearly there's no question that some of the negative impact of the currency translation has been offset by the widening of the spread. And the two are uncorrelated.", "You could see the currencies moving the other direction but the volatilities don't have to go along with them. But we'll keep you posted. As I said in the comments or in the question earlier, we're not assuming that volatilities remain at these highs. We're assuming some moderation in volatilities in the second half of the year. We're also not assuming that currency markets will go back to being sort of as calm as they were around this time last year.", "David Hochstim", "Right. So if they stayed close to these levels, we could see higher revenue than you have built in?", "Charlie Scharf", "It depends on what else it affects.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Exactly, there are other things. As I said, three things going on in that line. Higher volatilities will help us on that particular dimension. On the other hand, a move in currencies which affect the translation line and so on. There are many things going on in that line.", "Operator", "Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane", "Just wanted to hopefully get some way to quantify the Citi and Itau losses and is it offset by some of the gains that you've had? Just trying to think about future modeling purposes. And then secondly, on tokenization, my understanding is we'll probably suspend charging for any fees even beyond FY '16? Just hoping to get an update on that.", "Charlie Scharf", "So we don't talk specifically about the volumes of Citi and Itau. As I said in my remarks, not clear to us what the migration looks like. So it is hard to be very, very specific other than things like Costco and the other positive developments that we have make us feel very good about how those things all fit together. Tokenization, what's the question?", "Jack Carsky", "Are we going to continue to charge in 2016? Will we charge.", "Charlie Scharf", "So we have the rate card out there. We've waived it through 2016 and we're continuing to look at exactly what we think the right way -- I would say what the right long term way for people to think about tokenization is, but to me, the important thing is, no one should expect that to be a monetary driver for us.", "Operator", "We have Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Just wanted to ask on Europe, with legislation getting closer to being finalized. Does that change the probability of the put in any way? What's the latest there Charlie? And then just on Costco, real quick. Just the exclusive merchant acceptance, how critical is that for Costco, I guess, Visa? I know that's driving a lot of the uniqueness to it. Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "On the first one, listen, I don't think it changes the probabilities at all from our perspective, because we're not inside their board rooms to understand exactly what they're saying and what their drivers are. It's a consistent question that people ask us, in terms of what the probabilities are and we really don't know because they need the 80% vote. Until they get the 80%, then it's not going to happen.", "So really don't know, really don't understand what the dynamics are and again, what really matters is how the blocking group of people feel about it. So those that don't want to vote for it. That's something that we're not privy to because we're not in those boardroom discussions.", "But again, to circle back, we work really closely with Visa Europe. Example, whole group of people here today, Nicola, the CEO, is here today, as we're working through all the things that we're doing together to do a great job for our global clients, enable them to be as competitive as they can be versus the competition in Europe. And then the credit acceptance versus MasterCard and American Express, hugely relevant. That's why when you talk about the uniqueness of it, it just doesn't exist for a merchant this size that never accepted our product and now all of a sudden doesn't accept our other major competitors here in the United States.", "As we think about what that means for all of our clients and for our cardholders, that's certainly factored into our thinking and I'm sure the issuer is thinking in terms of the importance and what it could mean certainly for our brand.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that we would like to thank everybody for joining us today.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Dexter. Good early morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call and Visa Europe acquisition discussion. With us today from London are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Nicolas Huss, Visa Europe's Chief Executive Officer; while here in California we have Vasant Prabhu, Visa Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is being currently webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for the next 30 days. PowerPoint decks containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's earnings commentary and an overview of the Visa Europe transaction were posted to our website prior to this call.", "Let me also remind you that these presentations may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.

Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks a lot, Jack, and greetings from London. It's great to have Nicolas here as well, you'll be hearing from him in just a little bit. We certainly appreciate the early hours especially for those on the West Coast this morning. Given our announcement regarding Europe, we thought it was important to do the call as early as possible given the desire to communicate with our clients, employees and partners here in Europe. We're quite excited about our announcement and have a full agenda, so we'll try and move through our prepared material quickly, leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end.", "We have six topics to talk about this morning. First, we reported a solid fourth quarter and strong year-end to fiscal 2015. Second, we'll view our outlook for the fiscal 2016 year on a standalone basis. Third, I have some brief comments on previously announced dividend increase. And fourth, we announced the acquisition of Visa Europe. As you know, we have been clear that this was a transaction that we thought made tremendous sense for both our company but also for Visa Europe and its members, so we're thrilled to be able to move forward as one company.", "And with the Visa Europe acquisition, we announced two other items regarding our capital structure. First, our board has improved an increase to buyback authorization to bring the total available to $7.8 billion. And second, we announced that we will implement a new capital structure for the company. We intend to raise $15 billion to $16 billion of debt in conjunction with the Visa Europe announcement, but you'll see that we view this as a trigger to implement a more efficient long-term capital structure for the company.", "We'll first talk about our earnings results and outlook for 2016, then we'll discuss the Visa Europe acquisition and our capital actions, leaving time for questions.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Vasant.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, we have a lot to talk about on this call. I will only comment briefly on our fourth quarter and 2015 results and spend most of my time giving you as comprehensive a picture as we can of our outlook for fiscal 2016. We're pleased to report another strong quarter and full fiscal year results with solid revenue and earnings growth. Our high growth in a tepid global environment demonstrates yet again the fundamental resilience of our business model. Results were generally in line with our expectations going into the quarter with a few call-outs.", "First, our core metrics remained robust around the globe. The underlying secular conversion from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment continue at a fast clip as demonstrated by high domestic payment volume growth rates. This is obscured by the significant drag caused by the strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies over the course of the year. In the fourth quarter, this impact worsened as the dollar strengthened further against key currencies. This hurts us not only in currency translation terms but also in slowing cross-border volume growth.", "Second, as expected, client incentive levels in the quarter came in at 18.4%, well above the full year run rate of 17.1%. This sets us up well for fiscal 2016 payments volume growth. Several key renewals as well as a couple of significant wins will drive the incentive rate higher in 2016. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our outlook for 2016.", "Third, expense growth was somewhat higher than we had anticipated due to a legal settlement in Australia and Visa Europe transaction costs. This cost us about $0.01 of EPS in the quarter. Finally, we did not repurchase stock in the quarter due to the Visa Europe conversations that were underway. For the full year we repurchased 44.1 million shares at a price of just under $66 per share for a total of $2.9 billion. We currently have authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of stock under our prior plan and an incremental $5 million recently authorized by our board.", "Moving on to the quarter's business drivers and our financial results, global payments volume growth in constant dollars for the September quarter continued to be strong at 12%. U.S. credit grew 10%, moderating 2% compared to the June quarter as the positive effects of Chase conversion wane. U.S. debit grew at 9%, up 3 points from June. So gasoline prices continue to have a significant negative effect of approximately 2 percentage points growth in Interlink volume tied to certain routing wins offset a significant portion of the gas impact.", "International payments volume constant dollar growth of 15% was up over the prior quarter, with increases posted in all regions and more specifically followed by the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa and Mexico. More recently through October 28, U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, with U.S. credit growing 9%, and debit 10%, a slight downtick in credit and uptick in debit versus the fourth quarter.", "Global cross-border volume growth declined to 5% after three consecutive quarters of 8% constant dollar growth. As has been the case for several quarters now, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting key corridors of cross-border commerce. Specifically, outbound commerce from Russia, Canada and Brazil have deteriorated further in the past few months.", "While growth rates were still high in Q4, outbound commerce from China has seen a moderation in trend. Inbound commerce into the U.S. continue to drift lower in August and September. The bright spots are outbound commerce from the U.S. and the Middle East, commerce into Europe has been growing for most regions but as you know, we do not benefit as much from it currently.", "Despite the slowdown in cross-border payment volume growth and the significant negative drag from currency translation, international revenues grew 16%, helped by the previously announced pricing action and continued high currency volatility. Overall, growth was relatively \u2013 was impacted relatively equally by pricing and currency volatility. Through October 28, cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis has slowed further to 3%, in line with the August/September trend.", "Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled 18 billion in the fourth quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. delivered 11% growth while international growth was flat. International processed transaction growth is 13% when you normalize for the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April.", "Through October 28, process transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and an international growth rate that remained flat, the international rate of course being impacted by Russia.", "Overall, we had a strong finish to another solid year of top and bottom line growth. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.6 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year in constant dollars or 11% in nominal dollars. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was up 12% on a constant currency basis over 9% in nominal dollars.", "Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.62, a 16% increase in constant dollars or 14% on a nominal basis over the prior year's adjusted results. For the fiscal full year, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 18% on a constant currency basis, almost 16% in nominal dollars.", "With that, I'll move on to our outlook for fiscal 2016. Starting with payment volumes. Payment volumes globally have grown around 11% in constant dollars for the past two years. As we look ahead to 2016, we are anticipating an uptick in growth driven by the U.S. Most of the step-up in the U.S. growth rate is expected in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and beyond. The first quarter trend should be generally in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.", "As we enter the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we begin to fully lap the big gas price declines from last year. In the second half, USAA conversions are expected to start and then late in the fiscal year, Costco conversion should commence. Offsetting these to some extent will be the end of JPMorgan conversion gains. Outside the U.S., easier comparisons in our Latin America and CEMEA regions as they lap the sharp declines last year, and Brazil and Russia should help reported growth rates.", "If all this plays out as we expect, global payments volume growth will accelerate in 2016, ramping as the year progresses and setting us up nicely for 2017.", "Moving on to the cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you all know, are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, most particularly the U.S. dollar. In fiscal year 2015, we experienced sharp declines in outbound cross-border volume growth due to both these factors in key markets like Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil and Russia, starting late in the first quarter and worsening as the year progressed. Our large U.S. inbound business also declined as the dollar gained strength. And in the fourth quarter, Chinese outbound volume started to soften.", "Through the first half of fiscal 2016, we are not anticipating any meaningful improvement in cross-border growth rates from current levels. As we enter the second half, comparisons are easier and if the dollar stays stable or weakens, we could see an uptick in growth. Net-net, we expect the cross-border business will remain sluggish in the first half. Dollar strength and macroeconomic conditions will determine the second half. On balance, we are planning for improved cross-border growth rate in the second half of fiscal 2016.", "While cross-border growth slowed in FY 2015, currency volatility hit new highs as the year progressed, serving as a significant offset. Year-over-year growth rates were accentuated by the unusually low levels of volatility experienced in the second half of 2014. Speculation about Fed rate increases in the U.S., the sharp decline in commodity prices, uncertainty about Chinese growth, Greece, et cetera, all contributed to keep currency markets guessing.", "Given the high levels experienced in 2015, it seems very unlikely that volatility will be a tailwind again in 2016. Volatility has moderated in recent weeks and, although uncertainties persist, one might project a reversion to the mean for the year. Given all this, we are assuming that currency volatility will be a headwind throughout fiscal 2016 and significantly so as the year progresses when comparisons get a lot tougher.", "Processed transaction growth rates dipped from 10% in the first half to 8% in the second half as we transferred domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. About half of the domestic transactions shifted in Q3 and all domestic transactions in Q4 fiscal 2015. This will continue to impact reported transaction growth rates through the first three quarters of FY 2016. As we enter the second half, U.S. transaction growth rates will rise as we bring on USAA and then Costco volume.", "Moving to client incentives. In 2015, client incentives came in at 17.1% of gross revenue, below our expected range of 17.5% to 18.5%. This was due to volume shortfalls in markets like Russia and Brazil, delays in renewals, and some shift to dollars from incentives to gross price reductions. We anticipate a step-up in client incentives in fiscal year 2016 based on renewals completed to date and renewals anticipated in 2016, as well as the conversion of USAA and Costco.", "Among the significant renewals completed in 2015 were core brands like Southwest and United, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank in North America, large issuers in Russia, Japan, and Latin America. USAA-related incentives will kick in midyear and Costco later in the year. In 2016, we also expect several large renewals.", "Our current expectation is that client incentives as a percent of gross revenue could climb to the middle of the 17.5% to 18.5% range. The first quarter in particular should see a high level of renewal activity and the largest impact from renewals worldwide. The Q1 incentive rate will likely be at the high end of the full year range or possibly higher.", "With incentives growing faster than gross revenue, net revenue growth will lag gross revenue growth. In constant dollars, we anticipate fiscal year 2016 net revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Also, based on all the factors I discussed earlier, the first quarter growth rate will likely be 2 percentage points lower than the full year growth rate, with growth picking up as the year progresses. As a reminder, our service revenues lapped one quarter from payment volumes whereas incentives are booked in the quarter in which payment volumes occur.", "Which brings us to the currency translation impact from the strengthening dollar. The fiscal year 2015 impact of exchange rates was a 2.5 percentage point drag on net revenues, higher than we had anticipated at the start of the year. If we look at where the dollar is today and the basket of currencies we are exposed to, the FY 2016 impact looks to be 3 percentage points. The bulk of this impact is in currencies like the ruble, the real, the Venezuelan bolivar, the Argentinean peso, and the Canadian and Aussie dollars.", "On the expense front, we will continue to invest in key growth initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and other strategic programs as well as our long-term plan to bring key technology and customer service activities that are currently outsourced in-house. Network-related expenses will grow due to the full year impact of fees paid to NSPK for processing transactions in Russia. We will start to lap this added expense in Q4 2016.", "We will have significant startup costs to set up domestic operations in China. We are actively working on being in a position to compete domestically and will submit our application upon release of the final regulations. We are assuming China startup expenses will ramp through the year. We are holding the line on cost increases in all overhead functions. In nominal dollars, we expect a step-down in the rate of expense growth in fiscal year 2016 as a result of all these actions versus almost 6% growth in fiscal year 2015. Expense growth will run at a high single-digit clip in the first half and substantially lower in the second half.", "Our tax rate in 2015 came in at an adjusted 29.3%, almost 100 basis points lower than expected due to the favorable resolution of some tax items. As always, there are various tax initiatives underway. However, we expect our tax rate to normalize in fiscal year 2016 back to the low 30%s. In FY 2015, the lower than expected tax rate added over 1 percentage point to our EPS growth. In FY 2016, the anticipated increase in the rate could be as much as a 2 point drag on EPS growth.", "Now that we've announced the Visa Europe transaction, we can resume our stock buyback. It is fully our intent to step up the pace of buybacks immediately to make up for buybacks not completed in Q4 FY 2015. Despite this, our weighted average share count in 2016 will be higher than it would have been had we been buyers of our stock in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "When you put this all together, we expect our constant currency EPS growth in fiscal year 2016 to come in at the low end of the mid-teens range. Without the expected increase in the tax rate, EPS growth rates would be almost 2 percentage points higher. Furthermore, the currency translation impact will be higher on earnings than it is on revenue. We project a 4 percentage point drag on EPS growth from exchange rates. This is due to two main reasons. First, a larger proportion of our expenses are dollar denominated; and second, profits relative to revenues are proportionately higher in some of the higher rate (19:32) currencies.", "The first quarter EPS growth rate will be significantly lower in the mid-single digits for all the reasons I outlined earlier, a net revenue growth rate in Q1 that tracks a couple of percentage points below the full year run rate and an expense growth rate that will run meaningfully higher than the full year run rate. The EPS growth rate will step up as the year progresses except in the fiscal third quarter when we lapped a large tax benefit last year.", "As you can see, there are a variety of factors that will drive our revenue and EPS growth in fiscal year 2016. The key underlying drivers of our business remain very healthy. We expect a step-up in payments volume growth, major new accounts and renewals, good expense control resulting in healthy core revenue and earnings growth in constant dollars despite a generally uneven global economy.", "We have several significant factors driving down our reported growth rate in FY 2016 which should moderate with time. These are a potential regression to the meaningful currency volatilities, the continuing strength of the dollar impacting both the cross-border business and creating a currency translation drag, and a return to normalized tax rates.", "As the impact of these unfavorable year-over-year comparisons fades, the strong underlying growth momentum of our core business positions us well for robust reported growth in fiscal year 2017. We remain as bullish as we've ever been about the long-term secular trends in our business.", "As always, we will update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter. This outlook excludes the Visa Europe acquisition. When I come back, I'll walk through the potential financial impact of Visa Europe on fiscal year 2016.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks very much, Vasant. I'll try and keep my comments brief so we can move on to Europe. First of all, we're very happy with our performance both in the quarter and 2015. We continued to deliver strong results in a global economic environment which still has more headwinds than tailwinds for us.", "Adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% in the quarter and 16% for the full year include the continuing negative effects of a series of items, including the translation impact of a strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume driven by that strong dollar, and continuing drag from lower oil prices. Of course, there are positive offsets including strong payment volume, healthy processed transaction growth, and high currency volatility. Our strong results in the face of these pluses and minuses speak to the resilience of our business model.", "Regarding what we see across the world, I'll keep it simple and just say that the economic environment has shown little change over the last quarter, with some slight deterioration especially outside of the United States. Having said that, domestic activity is still fairly strong. And while we didn't get much help from an accelerating economic environment, our business still showed continued strong growth. Our longer term bullish growth outlook is intact and, most importantly, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to deliver, and these will continue to drive continued growth.", "We'll discuss capital in much more detail when we review the Europe transaction but I do want to comment on our recent dividend increase. We've discussed our view that the dividend is an important way for us to return capital to our shareholders. We've also said that we would hope to consistently grow the dividend as we grow the earnings of the company, and the recent 17% increase maintains the payout at our stated target range of below 20%s. Most importantly, we feel it's a strong statement that we're increasing our dividend at the same time that we're announcing such a significant transaction.", "Now, let me turn and make some comments about the fundamentals of our business. We continued strength in our key client relationships across the world. In the United States we're in a great position. Over the course of the year, we extended some of our biggest relationships which were up for renewal, including our partnership with Wells Fargo which we renewed just this quarter. We now have partnership agreements in place with five of our top six until at least 2020.", "Outside of the U.S., we're also in a very strong position. We continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world. For example, in Australia, we signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with the National Australian Bank. While we did had some notable losses this year, we also had successes winning significant new business with Costco and USAA.", "I want to just make a couple of observations about how we view pricing and share in this context. First of all and, most importantly, we view the big opportunity for us is to drive growth in the marketplace, and therefore, the most profitable growth is achieved by electronifying cash and check across the world, expanding participates in the electronic payments universe, and helping grow commerce more broadly. We believe this is how we create real long-term sustainable value. If you look at what's driven our revenue growth over the last several years, it's just that, not taking share from competitors. That's not to say the market isn't competitive; it is. And as you know, our competitors are very, very good and we respect them.", "And since we went public, you've seen clients make long-term partnership decisions, some of which have benefited us, others of which have benefited others. There will be situations where clients seek to do more business with us because of our capabilities, products and brand, and we will support them. We'll also defend our share aggressively. We will be competitive with the market but we do not seek to win deals solely on price. We do not view pricing on its own as the best mechanism to grow. So, I strongly believe in focusing on long-term value creation and that our future is about growing electronic payments and commerce broadly, and ultimately expanding into new or underpenetrated segments.", "Now, a few comments on the underlying business. Visa Checkout continues to gain momentum. We now have more than 7 million registered users in 16 countries, and over 470 financial institutions partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants are currently live globally including 10 of the top 50 e-commerce merchants. New merchant partners include Kohl's, Best Buy, Shutterfly, Lands' End, Fanatics, and Abercrombie & Fitch, to name a few.", "We also announced that we now have built the ability for issuers and merchants to tokenize Visa Checkout transactions. We expect this to begin in early 2016, as merchants and some issuers complete the work required to enable token acceptance. Many issuers are ready now, but given the rapid approach of the holiday season, we do not expect merchants to enable token acceptance as they head into their year-end annual system freezes. Second, as you all know, we partnered with Google and Samsung to bring two great new mobile experiences to market. Android Pay and Samsung Pay both launched their solutions in the U.S. in September and, in the upcoming months, will roll out their programs internationally.", "Third, we continue to build out our technology capabilities to deliver differentiated services in the marketplace. In September, we launched Visa Integrated Marketing Solutions, a card marketing platform designed to help small- to medium-sized issuers optimize their marketing efforts. It's a service offered by Visa Performance Solutions, which provides a range of advisory services to issuers, merchants, and acquirers, and is currently available to any Visa issuer in the United States interested in increasing their performance of their Visa consumer credit or debit portfolios, and the platform is expected to extend globally in the coming months.", "Last month, CyberSource launched Decision Manager Replay, the industry's first fraud tuning analytics tool which allows merchants to quickly analyze and adjust their online fraud management strategies. Merchants could take a batch of recent transactions and run them through the Decision Manager system, re-testing for fraud using more or less stringent risk levels. The system can reconfirm which transactions are fraudulent and which ones have been mistakenly flagged for fraud and denied but were in fact valid.", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, let me just share a couple of thoughts following Vasant's. Our guidance for 2016 is reflective of several things. First of all, it excludes the impact of Visa Europe, which will make the second half of our fiscal year more complicated. We will do our best to isolate the impacts for you so you can understand the impacts discretely and evaluate our sustainable performance. While we cannot predict the future any better than you can, we do have to make assumptions as we plan for the year. We have shared these in a fair amount of detail with you in addition to providing the numerical guidance but, at some point, you need to make your own determinations. Having said that, there are some things that I want to emphasize from Vasant's remarks.", "The effects of the strong dollar will have an increased negative effect on us in 2016 but there will be a point when the dollar stabilizes and we lap this effect. As Vasant said, we are planning for negative 3-point impact on revenue growth and 4 points on EPS growth in 2016 before we hope to see some improvement. Cross-border weakness continues but can change quickly with movements in the dollar and domestic economic growth.", "And please pay attention to Vasant's comments on timing. While we don't usually get as specific as we've done on this call, we do have some line of sight which would suggest that some of the items Vasant spoke about should impact the early part of the year disproportionally, especially Q1. Having said that, we always look through our results and ask what has changed about our views on growth beyond the fiscal year. We continue to feel great about our opportunity to drive revenue, earnings, and EPS growth for our shareholders. There's more cash to disintermediate than ever and we have more tools than ever to accomplish.", "And with that, let me switch gears and talk a bit about the Visa Europe transaction. Today, as you've seen, we announced that we and Visa Europe have entered into a definitive agreement for Visa Inc. to acquire Visa Europe. We're thrilled about the prospect to bring these two companies together and believe the transaction will benefit all involved. I'll give an overview of the transaction starting on page three of the prepared presentation, if you want to follow along. Nicolas will add some comments. After that, Vasant will cover the financial aspects in more detail before we take questions on all topics covered on the call here.", "We will acquire Visa Europe for an upfront consideration of \u20ac16.5 billion consisting of \u20ac11.5 billion in cash and \u20ac5 billion in convertible preferred stock. In addition, Visa Europe member-owners will potential receive an earn-out payment of up to \u20ac4 billion and \u20ac0.7 billion in interest. This earn-out will be based on the achievement of net revenue targets during the 2016 fiscal quarters following the close and provides additional upside to both parties if those agreed targets are met. It will be payable following the fourth anniversary of the transaction close.", "We plan to issue between $15 billion and $16 billion in senior unsecured debt to finance the transaction and establish a more efficient long-term capital structure. We plan to offset the effect of the issuance of preferred stock with increased stock buybacks and believe our capital structure will still provide us flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities, and as you know, this is obviously an attractive time to issue debt given the historically low interest rates. Our initial leverage will be between 1.4 and 1.5 times gross debt-to-EBITDA, and we target our long-term leverage at between 1.1 and 1.5 times gross debt-to-EBITDA.", "Based on discussions held with the rating agencies, we expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings of A+ and A1. The transaction has been approved by both Visa Inc. and the Visa Europe boards will result from the exercise of the amended put option and does not require VI or VE shareholder votes. It is subject to customary closing conditions and transaction regulatory approvals and we expect to close in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.", "Moving on to page four. Turning to the transaction rationale behind the transaction, this is obviously strategically important for both of us. We believe the combination will create significant benefits for both European and Visa Inc. clients. They will benefit as we work every day to earn their business bringing them the full power of our global platform, innovative products and services, as well as our world-class brand. The transaction will provide European clients with direct access to our investments in technology, differentiated products and services, capital, and talent. We'll also prioritize European needs in the allocation of our resources, and we believe we can deliver a stronger set of digital capabilities than would be possible without this combination.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Nicolas for him to add his perspective.", "Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.", "Thank you, Charlie. A few comments from a European perspective. The first one is that the time is right. Payments are increasingly global with more and more power from competition, scale and investment capacity are also increasingly important. Adding to this dynamic is regulation which you're all well aware is a key focus for our company and industry. We're now seeing the worlds of payment becoming more global from consumers traveling and shopping across borders through retailers and, of course, many of our most important bank issuers and acquirers being more regional or global players.", "We're also seeing the tech giants and mobile companies launching services in this payment space here in Europe and the relationship between issuers, acquirers, and merchants is changing. In terms of processing, scale is a critical driver of competitive advantage and becomes even more important in Europe with the mandatory separation of scheme processing activities.", "If I look at it from a customer perspective, Visa Inc. commitment to continuing to develop the European market is important for our clients. Representing 26% of total combined payment volumes, Europe will be Visa's second largest region. Our clients are reassured that there will be an empowered regional office (34:35) with strong regional focus processing in Europe and potential for investment that will be attractive to European members.", "From a management perspective now, the focus is on completing the transaction so that we can get on with integration. The signing is an exciting and significant milestone towards reuniting the two parts of Visa but up until completion, my message to the team will be that we also need to continue to deliver our strategy and the service that our members and stakeholders value highly. Continuing to deliver puts the business in the best position to benefit from the integration of the two organizations.", "Finally, I strongly believe that the uniqueness of this deal lies in the fact that our two companies already work together and have done so throughout our history. We share a brand, rules, and a number of operational practices further facilitating our union and rationale to come together.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Nicolas. Let me just make a comment about perspective from Visa Inc. This transaction does create a truly integrated global leader that will allow us to capitalize on strong growth opportunities in a highly attractive region. We also expect that it will create substantial value to revenue opportunities and cost efficiencies associated with the transaction from a member-owned association to a commercial entity and the opportunity to integrate the two businesses. We're also confident in our execution capabilities given our experience of transitioning to a commercial model from a member-owned model ourselves. Also remember, as Nicolas pointed out, we're merging two entities that have a close working relationship and share many common products and platforms.", "Let me make a few comments about our views on this financially. The transaction is financially attractive for both parties. With balanced consideration of a mix of cash, stock, and earn-out, we expect it to be accretive to our stand-alone revenue and EPS growth before transition costs beginning in fiscal year 2017, the first full year of the combination. The preferred shares offer current VE members continuing ownership stake in the company and also serves to provide liability protection to our Visa Inc. shareholders in conjunction with the new loss-sharing agreement with key UK banks. The earn-out provides additional upside potential for both parties if net revenue targets are achieved. We feel very good about the structure of the transaction since the balance consideration encourages the VE's current owners and VI to work together to enhance the long-term value of the business to the benefit of all parties. Vasant will go through this in more detail in a few minutes.", "I think in the interest of time, I will skip page five, which you can read on your own, which just talks about why we think it's an attractive growth opportunity; as well as page six, which is this current snapshot of the Visa European business; as well as page seven and eight, which show you the complexion of the new combined Visa.", "Let me move on and talk about page nine, which are our post-acquisition plans. Before I get into the details here, just want to make a comment about our ability to execute. We've done this transition before, as I pointed out, when we created Visa Inc. and have a great deal of experience, not just knowledge, of what's required. In addition, as I've already said, we also have people on both sides who have worked together for a long time and will benefit from those strong relationships.", "Since his arrival, Nicolas has made significant changes to VE which has resulted in an even closer working relationship between our two companies. He's also made changes to the business which are consistent with the way we would run the company going forward. He and I spent some time thinking about the integration process and our time line and approach will put clients first. In short, we know how to do this and will pace it properly.", "So, turning to our integration plans, I want to first recognize the shift in focus that occurs as we transition from a member-owned association to a commercial entity. The nature of our relationships with clients will evolve and we will be working hard to continue to earn their business. We think we've got a fantastic platform from which to do that with innovative and differentiated products and services, in addition to our world-class brand.", "We also plan to maintain a strong European presence, just as we do in our other regions. We expect to have a local empowered leadership team in Europe led by Nicolas, with the European headquarters here in London. In addition, we'll invest in the country resources needed to serve clients effectively. We intend to maintain a data center in Europe and will obviously continue to comply with European data privacy regulations.", "Finally, Visa Europe comprises 38 countries and we will ensure that we have country-specific strategies that are responsive to the evolving competitive and regulatory landscape. One of the strategic benefits of the transaction is that we will be able to deliver enhanced digital and mobile capabilities in Europe so this will be an important focus post-close. Our plan is to provide access to our Digital Solutions roadmap and partners. VE had already announced plans to roll out Visa Checkout and we're already working with them on that in the context of our existing partnership. We can extend to Europe all that we're doing to open our technology platform, which will enable collaboration and co-development of innovative payments experience.", "By combining the two companies, we do expect to get benefits of scale and efficiency, providing access to our infrastructure, products, and corporate services to VE. We will fully integrate the VI and VE systems, which we expect to take three to four years as we work carefully with our clients to do this properly.", "On the pricing side, we believe there is an opportunity to expand yields in Europe as we align the economic model with the value we bring and genuinely evaluate pricing from the perspective of a commercial enterprise rather than a member-owned association. However, we will be careful to remain competitively priced for our clients. It's obviously a very competitive environment and please remember that it wouldn't be intelligent for us to telegraph our specific plans, so we're not going to talk anymore about the specifics about pricing and yields.", "And with that, I'll hand it over to Vasant to go through some additional details about the transaction.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Charlie. On slide 10, we outline the financial impact of the acquisition on Visa. Assuming the transaction closes April 1 next year, 2016 will be a stub year with two quarters of Visa Europe in our numbers.", "We expect low single digit percentage point EPS dilution in fiscal year 2016 before onetime integration costs. There are three reasons for this. First, we will be issuing preferred share, which at the time of issue will on an as-converted basis amount to approximately 80 million shares of our class A shares, or 3.3% of shares outstanding. This creates almost $0.025 of EPS dilution each quarter until we buy back an equivalent amount of class A shares. We will be stepping up our stock purchases over and above our normal course buybacks to offset this dilutive impact.", "Our plan is to do this through open market purchases over six quarters post-closing. In other words, we expect to have bought back an amount of our class A shares equal to the preferred shares issued on an as-converted basis in addition to our normal buybacks by the end of 2017. As you may expect, the dilutive impacts of the shares issued to Visa Europe members will be greatest in the second half of 2016 and taper off through 2017.", "Second, we expect to issue $15 billion to $16 billion of debt with maturities from 2 years to 30 years. We're putting in place a long-term capital structure. The weighted average cost of this debt could be around 3% to 3.5% depending on market conditions. We are working with Visa Europe to prepare the required financial information which will include unaudited pro forma financial statements reflecting the combined entity under U.S. GAAP for fiscal year 2015. Market conditions permitting, we could be in the market in early December. Interest on the debt is expected to cost us $0.03 per share per quarter. This is $0.03 of dilution in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 if we have the debt in place three months before we close.", "Third, we're not assuming significant benefits from revenue and cost action in the second half of 2016. We will have some benefits, but they will not be material enough to offset the dilution from the stock and debt issued until 2017 and beyond. As we get to closing, we will refine our estimates and be able to give you a better sense of the impact on 2016 EPS.", "In fiscal year 2017, both revenue and cost benefits accruing from the acquisition will start to kick in, and the dilutive impacts of the share issuance will fade away. It is our current projection that Visa Europe will be accretive in fiscal year 2017, our first full year as a combined entity. 2017 accretion is expected to be in the low single digit percentage points range before integration costs.", "We will provide non-GAAP numbers that adjusts for onetime costs associated with the restructuring of Visa Europe as we integrated into Visa. We are working on purchase accounting and its associated impact on our financial statements. It is our current expectation that the bulk of the purchase price will be allocated to indefinite lived intangible assets which will not be amortized. Other than adjusting for onetime integration costs, we do not plan at this point to move to cash EPS reporting. Once again, we will provide more clarity as we get to closing.", "We expect the full integration to take until the end of 2020. As Charlie indicated, net revenue yields are expected to expand as we move to market-based pricing over time depending on client, competitive, and regulatory factors. On the cost front, the majority of the savings are derived from the technology integration which requires the most time. As such, technology-driven savings will be largely realized after 2017. We will have savings from organizational integration in 2017 and 2018, but we will also be making immediate investments in deploying our digital initiative and enhancing our client service model. We expect all the revenue and cost synergies from the Visa Europe transformation to be realized by 2020.", "In 2020, we would expect high single digit percentage point EPS accretion and Visa Europe operating margins to be comparable to Visa Inc. margins. In total, we're targeting $200 million in cost savings, or roughly 30% reduction from the current run rate. When we look at the current run rate, we exclude the royalty that Visa Europe is currently paying us. This is included in their reported expenses but, as you know, it is not a cost reduction for the combined entity. We also exclude noncash depreciation and amortization expenses.", "While we reduce cost where we can leverage Visa scale, we will also be adding cost as we invest to bring additional capabilities to our European clients, as well as to enhance the service we offer them at the local market level. As Charlie indicated, we will continue to operate with London as our regional hub much as we do today in Singapore, Dubai, and Miami for our other international regions. We will also retain a data center in the EU.", "To fully integrate Visa Europe, we will incur $450 million to $500 million in onetime cost over three years to four years. The bulk of these integration costs will be incurred to complete the technology transition. As I mentioned before, we will specifically identify these costs each quarter and update future estimates as needed until the integration is complete. We will have some onetime cash and noncash charges coincident with the closing of the transaction. Cash closing costs are estimated approximately $150 million which includes stamp duties payable in the UK plus the usual contingencies paid to bankers, lawyers, et cetera.", "Since the put will cease to exist at closing, we expect to reverse the put liability currently on our books a onetime noncash gain of $255 million. Also under U.S. GAAP, the royalty fee currently paid by Visa Europe is deemed to be below market. At closing, we have to establish the value we are realizing for implicitly paying Visa Europe to end this arrangement. As a result, we expect to record a $1.5 billion to $2 billion noncash write-off of the purchase price to reflect the settlement of the existing franchise agreement. Once again, we will have more precise estimates as we get to closing.", "Visa Europe operates as a U.S. taxpayer with a 35% tax rate. As you know, Visa's effective tax rate is currently below this. As such, our blended tax rate will increase modestly post-acquisition. As always, we will work on tax planning initiatives to reduce our tax rate over time.", "Moving to slide 11. As we've said for many years, we will put in place a long-term capital structure coincident with this acquisition. We intend to issue $15 billion to $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years. The size of each tranche will be adjusted based on market conditions. Our plan is to issue in the U.S. market in U.S. dollars for best execution. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio could rise to 1.5 times immediately post the acquisition. It is our plan to manage our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1.1 to 1.5 range. Based on our conversations with the rating agencies, we expect to maintain our current A+, A1 ratings at these leverage levels.", "Of course, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios will be significantly lower at all times given the cash we hold for settlement as well as any offshore cash. We could have used offshore cash to fund part of this transaction but have chosen not to do it at this time. Post-closing, we expect to put in place alternative structures that will allow us to achieve the same goal in a more logical and tax efficient manner.", "As I indicated earlier, we will use proceeds from the debt offering to fund the upfront cash payment to Visa Europe members as well as to increase stock buybacks through 2017 to offset the preferred stock issued. The capital structure we will have in place will not only be more efficient but will also not restrict our future flexibility to invest in growing our business organically, to fund appropriate M&A, and to maintain our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.", "Slide 12 provides a summary of sources and uses of cash. It's important to note that we expect to have approximately \u20ac2 billion or $2.3 billion of cash on the Visa Europe balance sheet which will transfer over to us at closing. This cash is freely available for settlement or general corporate purposes as needed. As I mentioned earlier, post-closing, we will work on restructuring some of the new entities to put in place mechanisms that will allow us to use excess cash we have offshore more efficiently. In terms of the upfront cash consideration, which is to be paid in euros, we plan to hedge a portion of our euro exposure between now and the close of this transaction.", "Moving to slide 13, Visa Europe members can realize a total value of up to \u20ac21.2 billion at the end of four years. Almost half this value is in the form of the earn-out and preferred shares. The earn-out provides additional upside potential to both parties if agreed net revenue targets are met cumulatively over 16 quarters post-closing. Preferred shares give Visa Europe members a continuing stake in Visa and the opportunity to benefit from the value we can create in Europe and globally. The preferred shares also provide a funding source for legal fees and litigation settlements if we have them in the future.", "As we do in the case of the class B shares, we will adjust conversion ratios to account for any payments made. There will be two series of preferred stock issued: one to UK and Ireland members; and the second to all other members of Visa Europe who are eligible to receive preferred stock. We will have an additional layer of coverage in the UK under a loss-sharing agreement with 11 of the largest UK members to directly fund settlements for domestic claims after certain levels of losses are paid from the UK and Ireland preferred stock. There will not be any additional indemnities in the UK for domestic claims.", "Outside the UK, the second layer of coverage will come from existing indemnities which will remain in place. This mechanism is designed to fund legal expenses and settlements, if any, related to interchange in the Visa Europe territory. Specifically, potential losses based on domestic and EU rates up to the value of the preferred shares are covered 100% by this mechanism as our 70% of potential losses based on inter-regional rates. In the UK, as necessary, Visa Inc. can rely on additional protection under the LSA for 91% of claims related to domestic interchange.", "Slide 14 describes how we expect to account for the earn-out and the preferred shares in our financial statement. The earn-out will be accounted for as contingent consideration. The fair value of the obligation will be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet at closing based on a probability rated estimate of the payout. Each quarter, we will mark this liability to market based on the revised view of the probability and size of the payout. This quarterly adjustment will be recorded as non-operating expense or income over the 16-quarter earn-out period post-closing.", "As a reminder, all these amounts will be noncash until the fourth anniversary post-closing. At this point, a cash payment will be made to Visa Europe members up to a maximum of \u20ac4 billion plus up to an additional \u20ac700 million of interest depending upon the cumulative net revenue performance of the business over the earn-out period. The preferred share will be recorded as equity at close based on the value of class A share equivalent at \u20ac5 billion with a small discount to reflect the restrictions around transferability of the shares. If covered litigation payments are made or legal expenses are incurred, the conversion ratio of the preferred shares is reduced with an offset to litigation or professional fee expenses. In addition, we expect to record the two noncash charges I mentioned earlier.", "With that, I'll turn this back to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Vasant. In summary, we're delighted to be reuniting the Visa family. We believe we've structured this in a way that creates value to grow Visa Europe members, our shareholders, and our clients globally. Before I turn it over to Jack, first, I want to thank both the Visa Europe team and that the Visa Europe board. To Visa Europe team, congratulations on a great company you built. Thank you for all that we've done together to this point and we look forward to being your partner as one combined company.", "And to the Visa Europe board, thank you for the energy, patience, detailed work and the way in which you focused in a balanced way on delivering both short and long-term value to your members. We'll work hard and I'm confident this combination will deliver both short and long-term benefits to your members.", "And with that, Jack, we'll turn it back to you.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Charlie. Dexter, at this time, we're ready to start the Q&A session. And I would like to just ask all of the folks listening today to limit yourself to a single question so as to provide more folks the opportunity to get on the call. Dexter?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the \u2013 Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Charlie, I heard you loud and clear that you don't want to talk about pricing, but one of the concerns that's been expressed is that the banks, once they kind of get their \u2013 once the check clears, would want to leave. Could you just talk about \u2013 obviously, you've got the earn-out payment and the preferred, could you talk about how you thought about that structure in terms of the long-term partnership with the current banks that make up Visa Europe?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I mean, let me start and Vasant can obviously chime in. Listen, I think, as we've \u2013 as both Vasant and I each talked about, we think the structure very much aligns the interest of us doing what makes sense for Visa Inc. as well as doing the right thing on behalf of the former members. And as I said, we live in a competitive world. We understand what goes on, but at the same time, we are going to have to transition from a member-owned structure to one which is different than that.", "So, again, all I can say is that we're very, very conscious of both sides of the dynamics which is, there's opportunity for us as a combined company, but we also have to do it very intelligently and very carefully in a way that our clients understand and, at this point, probably expect given all of the conversations directly that we've had with the board.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "David Togut - Evercore ISI", "Thank you and congratulations. Can you give us a sense of how the $200 million in cost savings will layer in approximately between FY 2017 and FY 2020?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. So, as I said in the comments, in 2017, mostly we will look at the global platform that Visa Inc. has and seek to integrate from an organizational standpoint Visa Europe into Visa Inc. There will be some adjustments in 2017, but then the bulk of the savings, as I mentioned, really come from harmonizing the two technology platforms. And what we will be doing in 2017 is really working on harmonizing the platforms. And then, as Charlie said, very carefully transitioning over to our new platform. We will run both platforms for a period of time, which is where some of these integration costs come in.", "Technology-related savings will kick in mostly in 2018 and beyond with the bulk of them in place by the end of 2019 and into early 2020. So, the savings pick up over time and that is factored in to the outlook we've given you. We will have accretion next year; when I say next year, I mean in fiscal year 2017. And then, we expect that we will be in the high single digit accretion range by the time we're done with all the integration.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And let me just add to that just a little bit of color around the reason why the conversion takes the amount of time that it takes. What we are not doing is just taking the existing platform we have and asking all of Visa Europe's clients to convert to that. The work that we have to do is to go through very carefully and understand what needs to get build out in the Visa Inc. systems to accommodate everything which is very specific for the European clientele. We then need to go build it and then we need to have a conversion plan in place that works on behalf of clients.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And the other thing I would just also mention, in case it wasn't entirely clear, is we will almost immediately, post the closing, make investments to bring additional capabilities to our European clients like Visa Checkout, as well as make investments to provide a level of service at a local level and enhance what we have today. So, there will be investments happening fairly quickly in the process, too.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you. I guess, Vasant, I heard you say, I think, that Visa Europe and Visa Inc. margins you're assuming will be equal at some point in time. Could you just talk about whether or not there might be some deviation in that? Just figured that you might be able to extract more synergies from Visa Europe on a combined platform. Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think what you've got is a best sense of things at this point in time. Obviously, as one gets into this and we go into years two and three, we'll learn more about all the possibilities in terms of both what we can do on the cost side, what we can do on the revenue side, and so on. I think this is, at this point, I think the best point of view we can offer you. And when you adjust for the royalties that Visa Europe is paying us, when you look at the cost savings we can generate, it gives you a sense of where margins can get to from where they are. And so, we feel good that by the time we're done with the integration, Visa Europe margins should be in the Visa Inc. range.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes. Thank you. Kind of shift gears to the core business, Charlie. The cross-border business obviously is probably one of the highest margin areas of the company. It continues to be light, I guess, even after the quarter. Do you think we've troughed here, or is your sense that you could tick a little bit lower?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, listen, the easy answer is we really don't know. There's been continuing weakness and the early part of this quarter is slightly below where we were running. But that's a call on, as Vasant talked about in his remarks, on the strengthening, the weakening of the dollar, and broader economic impact. I just \u2013 I do want to say relative to cross-border, when you think about what we have to offer and what our competitors have to offer, cross-border payments is hugely value added. It's something that we'll experience the kind of volatility that we've see given the impact of the dollar on people's ability to spend, but it doesn't change the long-term value that we provide in cross-border, and we believe that ultimately translates to volume as these things evolve over time and also as we start to lap decreases that we've seen.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Charlie or Nicolas, could you maybe comment specifically on whether the agreement includes any terms whereby the owners of Visa Europe re-up for a certain length of time and agree to remain at a certain issuance volume level or card level with Visa Inc.?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Listen, there are agreements in place in Visa Europe that stay intact and we work commercially beyond that. Beyond that, you can look at the structure yourself and see what that provides for.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Look, just on the financing side, you're bringing on roughly $15 billion to $16 billion in unsecured debt versus I think about $12 billion upfront needed and obviously you're using another $5 billion from preferred. I think you said, you mentioned in the past, you had about $5 billion plus of foreign cash and I know you mentioned you're not using it now. So just, when you think about all the cash you have there, $7-plus billion of free cash flow annually, can you just comment on the incremental buyback potential in addition to the $5 billion authorization you mentioned that we could potentially expect to see maybe even above and beyond the preferred?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, as we said earlier, we will borrow more than the cash that is paid out to Visa Europe up front. We will use that additional cash to step up our pace of buybacks. Our goal is to buy back the equivalent class A shares to offset the effect of the preferred shares issued over four to six quarters post the closing, so by the end of 2017. We will have more flexibility in the use of our offshore cash post the closing. We have a variety of plans that we expect to put in place and, as they fall into place, we'll talk to you about it. The goal will be then to have \u2013 not only have more freedom to move the offshore cash but also to move it efficiently and with minimal friction costs. I should also make sure you remember that we do keep cash available as a back-up for our daily settlement process. Some of that offshore cash today is used for that purpose so you shouldn't assume that all that is excess cash.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Jason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. Wanted to get a sense of how much revenue synergy is assumed in the fiscal 2017 and the fiscal 2020 accretion projection, and just directionally, how much of that might be expected to come from improvement in the net revenue yields versus other general sources of top line synergy like cross-selling?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, as Charlie said, we don't plan to talk much about specific pricing plans for obvious reasons. But as you look through sort of some of what we've told you, clearly, when you move from an association model, you would expect there to be improvement in net revenue yields. How much, how fast, exactly how, I think we've given ourselves the ability to do it in the way that makes the most sense competitively and otherwise. And there's not a whole lot more about this that we plan to talk about publicly, but you'll see as we go along how things evolve.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is now open.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the deal, guys. Wanted to start off going back to the core business, how do you guys think about the improvements in the net revenue yield given some of the puts and takes around cross-border, some large business coming up with Costco and the like, your thoughts about being able to drive that higher over the intermediate term?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, as you saw, I mean, we had some pricing last year. We'll get the benefit of that pricing in the first half of fiscal year 2016 also. Clearly, the mix of the business with growth we have happening outside the U.S. which is a higher net revenue yield business, the mix of the business improving in terms of e-commerce and so on helps yields. We'll always look for opportunities where we create value to price for that value. And over the past three or four years, you've seen some steady improvements in net revenue yields.", "So as Charlie said, I mean, fundamentally we like what we see in our business. The underlying trends of the business remain as good as they've ever been. We have some short-term what we consider to be transient drags on the business on a reported basis from some of the reasons I outlined. And then we have \u2013 as you see happening from time to time in this business, we have some big new wins, some big new renewals happening that have some impact in the early years and early quarters of those renewals and wins.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I would just add to that. First of all, I obviously agree completely with what Vasant said. When we talk about the specifics the way we're thinking about 2016, they are driven by some very, very discrete and very specific items that don't continue for the long term in this business as opposed to what we do believe is the strong underlying growth that you'll see especially as we get to the latter half of 2016 in the domestic business, and then ultimately in the cross-border business, and that's really what positions the core business to continue growing.", "But what I really do want to just \u2013 it would be remiss if I didn't point out is with commerce moving to digital platforms as we're seeing, we have more ways to involve ourselves in that commerce than ever before. And as we stood here \u2013 when this company went public and we talked about what we were going to do to attack all of the cash that was still on society, the things that we're talking about now, especially as it relates to mobile, didn't exist to the extent they do today. And so as we think about our ability to tackle and take advantage of disintermediating that cash and continue to provide value-added services alongside that, that's not in how we're thinking about 2016 or probably 2017, but that's what we come to work every day to try and drive, and why we feel so good about the long-term growth that still exists in the business.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Yeah, hi. Thanks. Considering the strong appearance of underinvestment in the Visa Europe platform since the recession, I was hoping for an honest assessment of where you see their capability now versus Visa globally. And also if you can discuss in terms of regulatory scrutiny that this deal is likely to come under, all things considered. Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, let me take a shot at the first one and then, Vasant, you can chime in on the second. On the first one, I personally think it's like a gross overstatement to talk about whatever words, Craig, you used to describe Visa's \u2013 Visa Europe's investment since the recession. My view \u2013 again, I've only been here three years and I'll tell you in the three years that I've been here, it was, I guess, a year into that or so that Nicolas joined, we have been working extremely closely together on leveraging our platform at Visa Inc. to help Visa Europe's clients.", "In addition to that, and I'm speaking for him but he can certainly chime in. He's sitting right here. He's been fairly aggressive about coming in and thinking about running the company the way you would think about running a for-profit company. And if those things together result in a lower expense base, so be it. That does not mean that they're not investing in the future of the company. I actually think just the opposite in a lot of what we're seeing. Having said that, even with all that he's been able to do as a standalone business, it's a small portion of what we'll be able to deliver as a combined company, both in terms of efficiencies and additional capabilities.", "Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.", "Yeah, that's a very good answer. I don't think I have anything specific to add to that.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And on the regulatory front, obviously, we've been in touch with the various authorities. They are aware of what has been underway. We have been in touch with them even as we got to this announcement. If you look at it from a regulatory standpoint, Visa Europe as part of Visa Inc. now has access to substantially greater financial resources, which makes it a financially much stronger player. Whether \u2013 if there's any concern around settlement risk management, the resources available now are vastly bigger. If it comes to concerns about cyber security, et cetera, you now have Visa Inc. and all our capabilities available to Visa Europe on an unfettered basis.", "So when you look at all that, we think this makes Visa Europe far more stable and stronger from a regulatory standpoint. We have indicated, as Charlie did, that we will maintain as we have with all the other Visa businesses, a very large local presence in London, and increase our local presence in many of the other key European markets. And we will continue to have a data center in the European Union and comply with all the regulatory requirements. So we really think that this is a big plus from the standpoint of what regulators care about.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Vasant (01:13:15)", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hold on. Hey, Jack, hold on.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Yes.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me just add to that for a second.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Sure.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just to be really specific for a second, when we look at the specific regulatory approvals required, there are three antitrust control filings which will take place. It's the European Commission, the Turkish Competition Authority, and the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority. And when we think about what this means for competitive reasons, we're very, very confident that we will get through this process in the timeframe that we spoke about. And then what Vasant is talking about goes beyond regulatory approvals required. It goes to the fact that our combined company and the way we intend to run it is very consistent with what we believe European regulators want out of this company.", "Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan...", "Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Trying to (01:14:15) answer to my first question, it was the best I've ever seen it. I don't want to embarrass the guy sitting next to me so...", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Tom McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi, guys. Visa Checkout seems to be a pretty significant initiative here in the United States. I was wondering if you could share with us the conversations, dialogue you're having with the European banks and their willingness to embrace that as well in the 38 countries in Europe.", "Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.", "Nicolas speaking. I think we've just started the process of talking to our customers about Visa Checkout. And they like the fact that it will be a common approach between what used to be up to now to Visa \u2013 two (01:15:02) different Visa company. And having said that, once again, we are very early in the process. So we'll see how it goes, but I see no reason why they shouldn't like it.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And let me just add just because I think this is second nature to Nicolas, but for the rest of us it's different than the environment we operate in. When decisions like that are made at Visa Europe, they are made with a great deal of effort from the Visa Europe management team. But I would describe it as deep involvement from the board, which includes some of the most significant and a fairly wide representative group of the clients that exist within Visa Europe. So it's not management on their own making a decision to do something. It's done management with the board that do, in fact, represent the existing clients.", "Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.", "And there was a lot of scrutiny from the board on this specific topic.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Excellent. Dexter, next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you so much. I just want to, I guess, try and assess how the terms of the earn-out tie with the accretion targets that you set. I heard the revenue targets. How about costs and the timely execution of the synergies, the $200 million that you called out, are they stipulated anywhere? Again, I'm just trying to gauge how visible the synergies are on the cost side. Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Tien-tsin, as we disclosed, the earn-out is linked to net revenue targets. So cost is not figured into it. Net revenue, we think, as you all know, reflects significantly value created in this business. It's also relatively easy to track. And the whole purpose of the earn-out is that if this business has greater value, then both sides benefit from that value.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Tucker of Egerton Capital. Your line is open. Mr. Paul Tucker, your line is now open.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Paul, are you there? Dexter, let's move on.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Susquehanna (sic) [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.", "Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. It's Smitti from Morgan Stanley. Charlie, just wondering if you could share more details or give us more update on the China opportunity. Any more granular details on when you could potentially get a license? And also can you share with us some of your early thoughts in terms of how you plan to address the issuing and acquiring side over there?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, listen, as far as timing goes, there's really not anything additionally to talk about, otherwise, I certainly would've covered it. We cannot submit our application until the final regulations come out. As best we understand, they're actively being worked on within the Chinese government. But again, it's up to the Chinese government, not up to us.", "Within our company, you can imagine that we are not sitting around and waiting for that event. We've got a tremendous amount of work going on inside the company, people working on both an application because there are a series of models out there for industries which have been opened up to competition. So we've done a fair amount of work on being prepared for that as well as there's a fair degree of \u2013 a fair line of sight relative to what our operating environment will have to look like within China. And so we've got a team of people working on being in a position to have that in place in the timeframe that's outlined in the licensing process.", "And then we've got our China team working on just what you asked, which is what our strategy is to grow the acquiring side of the business, because we've got a very, very big gap between where our cards are accepted and where UnionPay's are in the physical world, as well as the big opportunity that exists in the online space. And on the issuing side, as I pointed out many times, we have fairly deep relationships with Chinese banks as evidenced by the sizable cross-border business that we have today.", "So our domestic plans are regular part of the conversations we have with the issuers. So that's a very long way of saying we've got active plans that we're working through but obviously, we can't do anything until we're able to submit our application and then see what the Chinese government decides from there.", "Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. Thanks. Nicolas, in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that the relationship between issuers, acquirers and networks in Europe are changing. I was wondering if you or Charlie could elaborate on that. I know it's an open-ended question but your insights would be appreciated.", "Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.", "I think one of the points that will be changing due to regulation is the relationship with the retailers and therefore with the acquirers, and that's the point I was referring to. Once again, this will come out from the new regulation that we have, as you know, in Europe, and we will see that happening during next summer. My last comment maybe would be the fact that from a competition perspective, this might open a different approach to retailers. That's what I was referring to.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And the only thing I would add is those of us \u2013 those of you that have been following us for a while have heard us talk about the efforts that we have underway on the merchant side of our business. And we're very hopeful that the solutions, like what we announced with CyberSource this past quarter, will be all applicable within Europe to help build those relationships and ultimately the acquiring side of the business.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, hi, guys. Just to follow up on that, how do you guys believe the new European regs will impact Visa Europe? Will it be some positives and negatives and does it come out neutral? Or do you guys come out more on the positive end or negative end? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, listen, I think \u2013 I guess a couple things. Number one is, relative to the timing of the transaction for us, there's a fair amount of clarity at this point on what the environment looks like. So as we think about the way we forecasted the impact on our company as a combined entity, it takes into account what we believe the pluses and minuses are of the regulatory environment.", "When you look at things like the separation of scheme and processing where the final regs haven't been released but there's pretty clear direction where things are going, it's like anything else in life, there are potential pluses and potential minuses. And what we've got here is the ability to be very proactive about thinking through how we're going to make it a plus for us. I think that's as much as I want to say at this point.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Ken?", "Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Can you hear me?", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Yes.", "Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sorry. Okay. Charlie, I know you're reluctant to project too much here, but you point out the experience that you've had or Visa's had in terms of converting from a bank association, and I'm wondering, should we look back to that as a \u2013 the Visa Inc. transition as being a blueprint or a playbook for how you would approach Visa Europe here? Is that helpful at all for us?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, listen, I think \u2013 listen, the short answer is on most things, no, other than what we learned as we went through that in the training that the people at Visa Inc. have had on both sides, on being on the Visa Inc. side, call it, the U.S.-based part of the business, as well as the strong contingent of non-U.S. people, we've just been through and know how to do it.", "When we talk about like our lack of willingness or whatever words you use to talk about specifics, I actually think (01:24:27) we're being pretty clear here. What we're not doing is we're not telling you the specifics of what we intend to do on price. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, I hope you understand that that's the smart thing for us to do as opposed to lay out exactly what you're going to do. By the way, I can't imagine a company in any industry that would think that's a smart thing to do.", "So what we've done is, in lieu of that, is we've given you what we think the expense synergies are. We've laid out what we think our capital actions will be so you can get to your own point of view on what that means for our share count. And we've given you what we think will happen all in all relative to EPS accretion at different points of the transaction. So if you have all that, you should be able to do the revenue number, and behind that is what we believe we'll do overall in pricing.", "So again, what we're trying to do is be fair and transparent for this transaction because it is a different kind of transaction starting from a different place in a different environment, both competitively and from a regulatory perspective. So the case is built specific for this transaction but we're trying to create that balance of being as transparent as we can while not giving away anything competitively.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Dexter?", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Taking a step back from the details of the transaction, when you look out to 2020 and beyond, what effect do you think your Visa Europe acquisition as well as the regulatory changes in Europe will have on the underlying secular dynamics in Europe? Meaning adoption of card, adoption of digital, kind of mix of credit and debit. There's some sharp differences between some areas of Europe and much of the rest of the world.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Listen, there are, and I think \u2013 I guess broadly speaking, what I'd say is \u2013 and I know you all know this \u2013 but any time there is stronger competition, there's an ability to drive greater results. And so whether that means that because we are able to bring the capabilities that we have today and that we're able to continue to develop based specifically upon the European needs, that will allow us, we believe, to drive deeper penetration than Visa Europe would have been able to do on its own just because of the resource constraints that they had. As we become stronger here, our competitors will become stronger here as we've seen in other parts of the world.", "I know you all spend a lot of time comparing us to our competitors, we do as well because we want to learn and because we compete with them every day. But the reality is the stronger we each become, the stronger we make the other. And you see that as being evidenced in how \u2013 the swiftness that we move in the marketplace and the types of things that we are doing.", "And if you look at the types of things that we're doing as a company or MasterCard is doing as a company, I don't believe that those things would have been in market if we were continuing on as associations. So we do think that we will bring more competition to this market. The competitors will respond knowing that there's more competition. But our belief is there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity to electronify payments in the marketplace and we've got a greater ability to do that as a combined entity.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And the only other thing I would point out is despite all the troubles that Europe has had economically in the last five years, is you've seen from Visa Europe's reported numbers on payment volumes, there's been very healthy payment volume growth through that entire timeframe. And there still is a very large opportunity, as Charlie said, in Europe, in the 38 countries that will now be part of Visa Inc. to disintermediate cash and checks. So we're very excited about that kind of opportunity that was previously not part of \u2013 not available to Visa Inc. shareholders.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Dexter, at this point, we have one time for one final question.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And the last question is coming from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Yeah, thank you. And I want to ask a question on Chase Pay and the announcement with MCX, does that agreement change Visa's interaction with Chase or just the general payments transaction at all? And are you hearing from any other large issuers that are now more interested in an arrangement like ChaseNet?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Whatever they've announced doesn't change anything with any contractual agreement that we have with Chase. Whatever they've done with MCX is something that they've done. I would say that as we've said before, we have very active dialogue with our clients, both here in the U.S. and abroad \u2013 not here, I'm not in the U.S. right now \u2013 but in the U.S. and abroad of what the potential benefits of that structure are and whether that's something they're interested in.", "And to date, there has not been a lot of appetite. Whether that changes or not, we'll see. We are very, very focused on solutions that make it easier for all Visa cardholders to pay for things, anyway, whether it's a physical point of sale or in the digital space, and we will be aggressive in helping all of our clients to compete on that level playing field. Every single one of them regardless of what any one individual issuer does.", "Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Charlie. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your patience today. We know it was a very long call and we thank you all for joining us. And on the off chance that anybody actually has more questions, Victoria and I are around all day to take them. Thank you again.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks Nib. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for the 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website as well.", "Let me also remind you that these presentations may include forward-looking statements.

I am going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world and then I'll pass it over to Vasant before we take questions.", "First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative three percentage point impact from FX.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%, volume growth continued at a healthy pace, growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again healthy growth.", "International payment's volumes growth was 14% down one point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross border volume. U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it was offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China.", "We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us.", "Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season; overall consumer spending by our Visa Cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing.", "Ecommerce continue to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid teens eCommerce growth during the holiday period versus mid single digits growth in the physical world. More than 25% of all spending on Visa Cards during November and December was online up from less than 20% just three years ago.", "Also the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed, while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these two days than recent years and more people delay their spending to later in the season this year.", "Let me move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We received two of three required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission.", "Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing and most importantly we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement.", "We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point.", "We move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a complying operating environment. So we can compete domestically if we're awarded a license.", "I was in China last week and participated in the signing of two MOUs. They involve Visa working with two Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support property alleviation.", "The strategic partnership and programs we announced, underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese Government's goal of reducing property and promoting inclusive finance.", "We also continue to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a alleviating property, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development.", "As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the eCommerce space.", "Talk for a second about some client activity, in the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. bank where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card.", "Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and Fidelity Investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards in the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.", "Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam\u2019s Club. Beginning next Monday more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States in Port Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store.", "Walmart.com and Samsclub.com will also begin supporting Visa checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well. Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ New Zealand, ICCI Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China.", "In Latin America we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBBA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers seven markets including Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia and we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with PREDESCO another one of our largest issuers in Latin America.", "We talk say few words about Visa checkout we continued to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than $10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally.", "More than 250,000 merchants including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept these Visa checkout representing a $100 billion in addressable volume.", "Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments and as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and samsclub.com will also begin supporting it this year.", "Our confidence is Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the nation that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from TomScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion.", "Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout.", "We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the trail paid platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales.", "Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa cards to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To-date more than a dozen leading merchants including Duck Donuts, Regal Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber.", "Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa Card at certain local retailers.", "Say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kick off to chip in the U.S. We\u2019re optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate ship terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions.", "Already there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. then in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015.", "43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume, 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume, over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV representing 17% of the total face to face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client survey we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year.", "While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical massive adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress today.", "Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It\u2019s clearly a mixed bag but certainly creating some short term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short term.", "As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume driven by the strong dollar, continuing drag from lower oil prices and while we\u2019re believers in China for the long term the domestic volatility it's creating increased headwinds for us.", "These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation effects as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but our ability to grow over the long term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth.", "So, our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds, but the long term fundamentals of our business volume growth remained strong.", "And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly with changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world, it\u2019s just hard to predict the timing.", "Vasant will cover in more detail but even though there has been much talk over the past few weeks of the slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong.", "So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise, but the pressure as we have seen we likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating.", "Now over to Vasant.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Thanks Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter as a result modestly ahead of our expectations.", "A few highlights; net operating revenue was increased 8% in constant dollars, the exchange rate drag was three percentage points both in line with expectations.", "Weaker than anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower than expected client incentive. Client incentives were lower due to software volumes in international markets and some deal delays.", "Expenses only grew 2% well below the high single digit rate we had indicted. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment.", "As the year progresses we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We mark down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to zero since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition.", "We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We are still awaiting regulatory clearance but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement leading us to load the value of the put, this non-cash non-operating gain added $0.10 to our reported earnings.", "As a reminder should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its un-amended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point.", "In December we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with the weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This is the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rate range we indicted last year.", "We're pleased with this outcome. We will of course use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next five to six quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will issue to VE members.", "For the next section now in place, we will have interest expenses of a $125 million each quarter almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income.", "Finally we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 was shared for a total of $2 billion. As we have indicated we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction.", "At the end of the quarter we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We've continued to be buying of our stock in January under our 10b5 programs.", "Moving on to the quarter business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continued to be strong at 11%, U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating one percentage point compared to the September quarter as the positive effects of Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up one percentage point benefitting from some interlinked gains.", "Adjusted for conversion and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volume for both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters.", "In the quarter, the gas price drag was around one percentage point on credit and two percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year.", "This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of one percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses.", "International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down one percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rate in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets.", "Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volume has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms.", "Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continues to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter.", "In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East and the strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and I had hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and/or the dollar stabilized.", "Given recent trends, that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil linked and China linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%.", "On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East. Also closing of the Visa Europe transaction we'll begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe.", "Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled 19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter. The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter.", "As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and flat into national growth.", "Turning to our financial results, service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%. Both were in line with our expectation.", "International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth.", "The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rate. While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to the China and the Middle East.", "Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3% primarily as a result of low license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth.", "As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%.", "We held the line on personnel cost and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and phased in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSPK transition in Russia. Reported G&A expenses were up driven by a variety of factors including exchange rate adjustments and cost of product enhancement.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3% modestly lower than our full year expectation of low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged.", "Looking ahead to the second quarter, service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and we will lap high volatilities from last year.", "The exchange rate drag remains approximately three percentage points. Net-net, mid single digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained. Expense growth rate will step up through the mid single digit range with increases in personnel cost and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia.", "One big change between the two quarters, which is important to note is interest expense. We will have a full quarter's interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.4 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going-forward.", "As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in international markets and the risk that will impact the U.S. As you may recall for our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and high cross border growth due to easier comparisons.", "Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives that are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half.", "In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations inclusive of Visa Europe when we talked to you again at the end of April.", "With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Vasant. Sam, at this time, we're ready to start the Q&A. And I'd remind everybody if they could please keep their questions to a single question and then queue back up so that more folks are able to get on the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Bob Napoli", "Thank you and good afternoon. A question just on the competitive intensity of the industry and any changes you may be seeing. Certainly the credit card industry broadly at the margin continues to seem to get somewhat more competitive and you also have some regulatory challenges around the world.", "And historically, this hasn't really been able to penetrate its way through to Visa and Master Card revenue yields or I just -- wondering if you could you any update given the competitive changes on the issuer side and the regulatory changes if there is anything for us to be concerned about on the revenue yield for the business?", "Charlie Scharf", "Well, I think the business is competitive and I always remind everyone that our business has been competitive since the day we went public. We and Master Card evolved our structures roughly the same period of time. We compete in the marketplace every single day. And that has been a very consistent way of doing business.", "Domestically, across the world there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese Union Pay in the traditional space as well as a series of people in the eCom whose names you know that we continue to compete with.", "I think when we think about what we have at Visa in the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete.", "And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business.", "And we think that there are couple of us with us leading the pack who are uniquely qualified to do that. And so those views I think are very consistent with where they were last quarter, last year and a couple of years ago.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Dan Perlin", "So the question I have is as you think about serving all these incremental constituencies, you're much more merchant direct and centric and then also much more consumer direct and centric.", "I'm wondering how you're prioritizing your expenses when you think about throttling back on projects and what we should be mindful of, because I look back on your expense lines may be back in, we were coming out of the last recession, your marketing dollars as an absolute dollar were almost kind of absolute levels. So I don't know if you pulled that back to norm. I'm wondering where do you throttle back. Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yes. So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant you can add anything you want to add. I think so first of all, it's us who want to want to be really just clear for a second is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct.", "There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant, but it's in a way that's of course a four-party model in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquires. We're just acting as a facilitator.", "So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is we are consumer brand and we have a role that we've got to play there.", "When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to re-phasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated in our minds relate to anything, which is going to help build the business for the future.", "If you ask us, are we as efficient as we should be? Are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place? The answer is no and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at where we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars.", "So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building or digital business. The APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services.", "We're still very, very committed to building that and as we think about what this environment does is, it's just creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long term. So we're not going to change the things that we think build the business for a long term as we said here.", "Vasant Prabhu", "And the only other thing I would add is we've said that the expense growth rate will be back in the mid single digits in the second quarters. And as Charlie said, there is nothing we've done to date that does anything in terms of either the funding or the pacing of critical initiative whether that's Visa Checkout, Visa Direct is token service, all the critical initiative.", "Times like these are a good opportunity to take a hard look at -- is every dollar well spend and prioritized once again. And we took some time to do that in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the expense growth rate will be back in the mid single digits. And we'll keep monitoring the external situation.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, Sam.", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. Next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.", "Chris Brendler", "Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask another question on competitive environments and get your updated thoughts on PayPal in particular. It seems like they've been a good supporter of our online volumes and a lot of transactions are funded by cards.", "But the opportunity seems a little bit different from the remediation threat. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that particularly threat? And also when it comes to Briantree venture of the in-app development and the potential for remediation risk there, is there competitive response from Visa to some of the technology that they've enabled to or that kind of stuff.", "Is that area that you could potentially expand and soon become a competitor when it comes to online in that purchases. Thanks.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah, let me -- let me do the first one first. I\u2019m not going to talk about any specific company. What I will say is that we love partnering with people that we think are good for the payment system and preserve our client's roles and our role in the ecosystem and there are many examples around the world of people that we partner with in ordered to do that.", "There are also some examples of people that don\u2019t do that and people that generate business for us in the short term whose business model is built around dis-intermediating us eventually and our clients is not something that we like, not something that we support and not something that we're just going to sit ideally by and watch.", "Our first preference is to figure out how to work differently with those people. Those are the active conversations that we're engaged in. If we can't get to a predicted conclusion there are a lot of things at our disposal that we can do which we have not done, which will enable us we believe to compete in a very clear and very direct way in a way that\u2019s a level playing field for everyone.", "And so our first preference is to figure out how to partner with people, but if that doesn\u2019t work out then we will compete directly with them and that will evolve in the near future and so more to come on that and the second question was around\u2026", "I guess the question was there are people like Braintree out there whose services help enable mobile commerce and what\u2019s our response to that and on this one, our response is multiple on multiple fronts.", "First of all we have a great business in cyber source where we also own a business called authorize.net that deals with smaller merchants and helps enable smaller merchants to accept online payment.", "That business is focused both in the browser space, but also in the mobile space and we've just made a series of changes internally with some leadership changes that we're very excited about to help reenergize the business there and to be in a position to compete.", "We also made an investment in Strip and work very closely with them and we think they\u2019re just extremely talented people who are almost solely focused on the mobile space and enabling mobile commerce in a way that\u2019s very friendly to us and we're excited to continue to help them build their business globally.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question Sam.", "Operator", "Yes, thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great, could you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned a couple of very large merchants that are going to be deploying Visa Checkout this year.", "Can you talk a little bit about what the sales and implementation cycle might be and how to think about the progression perhaps over the next couple of years in that does it seems like it's pretty important from a competitive standpoint?", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah, so the sales cycle -- honestly the sales cycle varies dramatically with the priorities that the individual merchants have and obviously the more continuing success that we have changes that sales cycle as well.", "When we're able to quote the kind of numbers that we're able to quote on comScore for what it actually does to merchant sites and the merchants themselves and actually share those experiences, nothing changes the sales discussion more than that.", "And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions. It could be six to nine months in terms of a calling process if not longer. I'll tell you I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout.", "So it really is -- the game is changing, but we also in our minds we know, this is merchant by merchants, it\u2019s a long term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these -- about the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants.", "The implementation piece -- I hear what it was, but its dramatically quicker and easier for merchants to implement. If they can fit us into their queue it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation it was multiple months.", "So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that its priority for them and that\u2019s what we're starting to see.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Thanks guys, so this quarter clearly seems to support that Visa can really protect the bottom line with cost controls and more or less any macro climate, but obviously the tone is getting understandably more cautious regarding the global volume outlook.", "So, I understand you're not changing your fiscal '16 revenue growth guidance, but just curious whether or not the lower end now feels more likely than it did at the time of the last earnings call. And then just very quickly any metrics on Visa Checkout volume you can share.", "Vasant Prabhu", "I\u2019ll just jumping on your first question. The thing to point out is if you look at international payment volumes as we said in our comments, in constant dollars they were actually up 14%. So it's still incredibly healthy growth and then in nominal terms, it comes down to zero.", "If you can see what an huge impact exchange rates have had and U.S. payment volumes both credit and debit if you adjust for conversion and GAAP have been remarkably stable. So that\u2019s what makes us optimistic about the long term.", "In the short run as Charlie said there is two issues, it's the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S. which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag now for multiple years. The dollar also affects translation. You saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to zero it's huge.", "And the cross-border trends, clearly are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what\u2019s happening in commodity markets China etcetera.", "So, we feel these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business and so we really don\u2019t want to change anything in terms of our long-term profile of investment, but we are also mindful of the fact that the new few quarters we will face the same pressures.", "So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing, they are not fundamentally changing anything in our investment posture and I guess the next question was on Visa Checkout numbers. I think you provided some in your comments.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah but we actually don\u2019t provide the volumes.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks very much. Charlie my question is also on an element of the competitive environment, which is we\u2019ve seen Visa now maybe partnership in new ways with some of the banks in order to win portfolios that were and co brand relationships that were up for [RFP] and of course there is the evolving relationship with JPMorgan and what they're doing now on Chase Pay.", "And so I wonder is there something occurring now between Visa and the banks in terms of that the kind of relationship that banks are seeking to have with you in the United States that's different than in the past because it seems like the stance is a little more aggressive in response to some of the dynamics that are making growth to hard to come by in the States.", "Charlie Scharf", "I think it\u2019s a good question. I think and I think there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years past, since we have transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point -- I am sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like.", "And so what you start to see now is at the same time payments evolving very, very rapidly driven mostly by digital, but by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses broadly including the debit card business and the credit card businesses are now very much a part of what a bank does and why they think about their entire relationships as opposed to five, six , seven, eight years ago we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies.", "So all a sudden being integrated into a bank, but still being run separately. So as they combined these businesses and really run them as an integrated business they're now thinking about how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third party provider services.", "So what you're seeing is you're seeing longer term contracts whether its people used to do one and two year contracts and now you've seen us do three, five, seven and 10 in some cases and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a -- it is a different kind of relationship.", "I think the other thing that\u2019s going on in the marketplace is you start to see especially here in the United States banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients and they're able to compete with the like of other names out there that they didn\u2019t necessarily focus on before and are having great success in that.", "And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive in some of these co brands and some of these other things that you see.", "So, what we want to do is to be the payment partner of choice, to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services and you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partners is and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it\u2019s a more competitive marketplace.", "But again to me that's something we\u2019ve seen it increasing over a period of time and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payments space today than there were three years ago, five years ago or 10 years ago.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jim Schneider", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if I could ask a question about the U.S. consumer trends that you're seeing. Clearly it sounds like from the data you\u2019ve seen so far, I was seeing any material downtick in the U.S. consumer although you\u2019re watching it very closely.", "But can you maybe talk about any other kind of underlying stats you're looking at. I think almost a year ago you talked about the speculation about lower gas prices driving increased saving and banking of that savings.", "I am wondering if you\u2019re seeing any evidence of increasing discretionary spend and then just as a clarification relative to the one point of acceleration you mentioned so far, year-to-date if I strip out the effect of lower gas prices, would you still be seeing the same consistent underlying trends or the one point of acceleration. Thank you.", "Vasant Prabhu", "I think what we're seeing is a very stable U.S. consumer environment. If you look at multiple quarters all the way through last year and into this year and you adjust for as we said conversions and gas prices it's in very stable for any question marks about whether the benefits from gas prices floating into. We've seen a little bit of that on the debit side as we said that earlier.", "Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining, but gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a two percentage point impact on debit one on credit that will moderate, but won\u2019t go away completely. So most of it we would ascribe to that.", "Wouldn\u2019t read too much into three weeks of January, we then had some awful weather in the last few weeks, last few days and that definitely will affect some of the commerce. But overall I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot more we have to add than what Charlie gave you in terms of holiday spend shift to commerce channels. I don't know if there is anything else you could add.", "Charlie Scharf", "No I think that\u2019s it.", "Jack Carsky", "Okay. Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks guys, look I just want to follow up on guidance, since your guidance was provided last quarter, we had further deterioration on some macro areas like you mentioned gas prices and definitely some of the emerging oil based economies, but again you maintained your guidance for now and did pretty well in the quarter.", "So I guess as of now do you include similar trends on the slower areas like Brazil, Russia, Middle East as persisting at these similar rates throughout the year and then what if anything would you say has been a surprise to the opposite since last quarter on revenue that might offset the slower macro, maybe it was cross-border versus the 3% right, if you can just give you us more color on that. Thanks guys.", "Charlie Scharf", "Yeah, listen this whole concept of guidance is it\u2019s a very strange thing right because you're asking us what we think our volumes will be next quarter, the quarter after that and the quarter after that? And we know a little more than you know, not a whole lot more.", "So asking people to give procession in terms of what\u2019s going to happen effectively to the dollar, consumer conference, things like that. We really don\u2019t know. So, what we try and to do is be as transparent as we can about what do know.", "And we recognize that it's hard sometimes to figure out what a trend is and it's hard to know what the triggers will be to either seen an uptick or downtick. So we try to be very clear in our remarks that we\u2019re not changing guidance, but if we don\u2019t see improvement then the guidance will come under pressure.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yeah and I think if you want to know what could offset, we told you that we saw some additional factors that were causing deceleration in cross-border trends and that was really two main things that was travel out of China and it was travel out of oil linked economies.", "What could cause -- what is the most significant variable that could cause trends to change in a positive way do we know what's going to happen? We don\u2019t, but it\u2019s the dollar.", "If the dollar begins to show some signs of weakness clearly it has a big impact on our business not immediately, but over time on two fronts. One the translation impact, which you can all estimate, but then there is the other impact, which will play out over time which is, commerce into the U.S., which is a big part of our business.", "And then in the second half certainly Europe will be part of Visa and the travel into Europe has been better than travel into other geographies. So hopefully, that will help us and some of that we knew going into the other end and giving some of our perspectives we incorporate some of that.", "Charlie Scharf", "Just to give you a little sense. We were looking earlier in detail at the cross-board spend and if you look at -- look over a much longer period of time when you go back to when our cross-border growth was in the low double-digits versus where it is today and say where is -- what\u2019s the biggest effect?", "Almost something like 75% or 80% of that effect is -- the reduction is from sales wired in the U.S. So it\u2019s the drop in spending of non-U.S. cardholders in the United States.", "Just -- it\u2019s a very, very dramatic, very clear, very specific item predominately driven by the dollar, not totally, but predominately driven by the dollar and it moves quickly on the way down and at some point it could quickly change the other way as well we just don't know when.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question Sam?", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Ken Bruce", "Thanks, good afternoon. My questions really relate to some earlier comments, I\u2019ve recognized that you have some expenses that you can manage. I was wondering if you might be able to provide some sense as to what you would -- how we should be thinking about what would be core spending or core investments in the expenses versus may be some of those areas that you talked about in terms of gaining more efficiency.", "So, just so we kind of have an understanding as to how much leverage you have from that standpoint. And then second question are you --and this is granular, but are you seeing any changes in activity within the U.S. in those areas that are particularly known for high energy or high exposure to gas and oil in particular? Thank you.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yeah I think you can see some of this from things that we might put out through our economics, but there is clearly this, you can see the subdued activity in oil, oil related states and the West is doing better in aggregate then other parts of the country.", "But other than that I don\u2019t think there is anything we would tell you that is not available from other sources of data that you see.", "The other question was on the cost side. What we said earlier was cost related to technology initiatives that are critical to product development for the future, cyber security, those have a long-term -- we have a long-term perspective on that and there really is no change in our posture on those things.", "It's on the margin where we can tighten the belt on things that maybe somewhat more discretionary and you could do them later or you could do them now and there comes a point where you criminally don't want to cut below a certain level. So we're being very prudent.", "We see many of these as transient and cyclical kinds of things with some strong underlying trend. So we see no reason to change our posture on our long-term investment outlook.", "Charlie Scharf", "And the only thing I would add is that we're going through the initial discussions with our colleagues at Visa Europe and so obviously after we close the transaction, we'll go with full fledged integration.", "And that just is an opportunity to help us focus on efficiency in general and just to repeat what we said is that we still are believers that the underlying trends in the business are extraordinarily strong that there are places that commerce is moving to and we're building the appropriate solutions that will enable us to be as successful in the digital world and the physical world and we're very committed to continue to invest in that space.", "But remember we are a very young for-profit company. It wasn\u2019t that long that we were an association and so opportunities to focus internally and to get smart about where you're spending your dollars to ensure that they're going towards the future and towards client-driven things is a good thing and that's our focus as we talk about the allocation of our resources.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. I guess I have a question on the share buyback and the dilution offset to the preferred issuance. Understanding the markets are volatile, but is there anything that precludes you from maybe having a little bit of a shorter time horizon in repurchasing those shares?", "And then just one data point question. Do we have -- and I am sorry if you guys have disclosed this before, but do we have a specific number on how much of your volume is travel that's coming out of China into other countries? Thank you.", "Vasant Prabhu", "I believe on the second question no, we don't -- we don't provide that. In terms of buyback if you calibrate the buybacks, as you know our buybacks have always been more problematic than opportunistic, but within the programmatic buyback, you've seen us calibrate up or down depending on market conditions and assessment of valuations and so on.", "So yes, there are opportunities to speed it up if we want to, but I think our best expectation remains what we told you earlier, which is that our goal is to buyback or offset the dilution caused by the issuance of the preferred stock by the end of fiscal year 2017?", "The pace in which we do that whether it's more in some quarters, less in others, I am sure will calibrate as each quarter comes by.", "Charlie Scharf", "The only thing I'll say is to add on that is we have and well, I guess I will say this way, if you look at our actions on the debt offer, we issued the debt in December well ahead of what we expect to be the closing day because we looked at what we thought the right long-term economic decision was as opposed to what the negative effect would be this quarter and next quarter.", "And so when it comes to buybacks, it's the same economic discussion and obviously depending on the size, depending on how you want to accelerate there are different cost to do those things and we think about that in terms of what the right thing for us to do is.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Craig Maurer", "Hi thanks. Two questions. First just on -- should we expect the incentives that were pushed out due to the delays on show up in the fiscal second quarter or will they be spread out more through the year.", "And secondly, Charlie Visa Checkout, we've been noticing a lot of incentives being pushed through the channel for consumers to sign up and use the offering and I was just wondering if you could comment at all regarding potential share gains against competitors in the digital wild space if there is any anecdotal evident there yet, thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Our planned incentive as I mentioned in my comments, some of the reason they were lower than we expected, they were in the middle of the range rather than the high end of the range. So it was a small difference.", "Partially it was volumes because our international volumes were lower and so you get a reduction in incentive payments as a result of lower volume and it was only partially because of delays and some of those yes, they will move into the second quarter and so you should expect that the second quarter time incentive range will not look a whole lot different than the first quarter, but these are small shifts. These are not big shifts.", "And I tuned at after the first quarter. What was the second question.", "Craig Maurer", "Visa Checkout. Visa Checkouts anecdotally do we now for gaining share of other Checkout IT solutions.", "Charlie Scharf", "I don't know the answer to that to be honest.", "Jack Carsky", "And we will go to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Keane", "Thanks. I just wanted to ask again about the revenue sensitivity. So if cross-border doesn\u2019t accelerate in the U.S., doesn\u2019t accelerate in the second half '16 as is in the guidance and let's just say the cross-border stays at this depressed level along with the U.S. staying more the same, are we talking about potentially then the revenue guidance for the full fiscal year '16 has to come in and you would protect kind of the bottom lines or other cost cuts.", "Just want to make sure I know the sensitivity of what happens if it stays more the same environment, thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yes, I think you can probably run those numbers as well as we can. Cross-border the international revenues are roughly 20% of our revenue base and they're about 6% now and maybe there was an expectation that it would be somewhat better in the second half as we lap easier comparison.", "You can sort of look at it if it stays at these levels what -- we wouldn't do anything that would be wrong for the long term in our business. As we said, we will continue to look at phasing and prioritizing expenses while investing in things that matter.", "So I think we're suggesting that we can offset all revenue shortfalls that might emerge and it is too early really to tell you how the second half might shape. As you know, when we get to the second half, the comparisons do get somewhat easier. So we'll have to see how that plays out.", "We'll have to see what the dollar is doing at that point. Lots of unknown. We've given you our best sense of the next quarter. It looks to be very similar to what we saw in the first quarter and that's about as good as\u2026", "Charlie Scharf", "The only thing I would add, let me, to your point Vasant is we tried -- we feel like we've got a much better line of sight obviously to the next quarter. So we try to be as clear as we can there and as we get to the end of the next quarter, at that point we should -- we should have a much more definitive point of view on what the year looks like as well as the impact of what the year will be at that point in time.", "Jack Carsky", "At this point, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just and good job on the expenses here, I just wanted to ask about some of the tailwinds and if there is any update on the timing and I am curious if your outlook already contemplates USA and I guess Cosco and some of those things coming on, thanks?", "Charlie Scharf", "Yes, there is no update on those things. They're all proceeding on plan and they were in our guidance.", "Jack Carsky", "And with that, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give either myself or Victoria a call. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you, speakers. And this does conclude today's conference.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.Visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements.

Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually, Jack, it's Charlie. I'm going to start on the call.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "I'm sorry.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I appreciate it though. Good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining us. There are a series of things that I'm going to cover before I do hand it over to Vasant. I'm going to talk a little bit about our second quarter results at a high level, make some comments about the press release we put out about Visa Europe [VE], some general business updates, and then some further comments on how we see the year playing out from here.", "So first let me start with our overall results. We reported earnings per share of $0.71, but this includes a one-time gain on currency forward contracts used to mitigate some of the foreign exchange risk associated with the cash portion of the VE purchase. Vasant will cover that in a little bit more detail in his remarks.", "If you exclude that gain, adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 grew 7% on a nominal basis and 12% on a constant dollar basis. If you remember, we raised $16 billion in long-term debt in December of last year in anticipation of the VE acquisition, and we absorbed $125 million in interest expense during this quarter, a $0.03 drag on our EPS growth for the quarter. This negatively impacted our EPS growth rate in the quarter by five points. After we close the VE transaction, we will obviously have VE operating income to offset this expense.", "As we talk about the quarter, you're going to hear some themes which will sound very much the same as those we discussed on our last earnings call, reasonable underlying domestic growth offset by some headwinds. Our results adjusting for the leap year were very consistent with the prior quarter. And our growth continues to be subdued by the strength of the dollar on both translation and cross-border business volumes, continued low oil prices, and weakness in China, oil-based economies, and Brazil. But importantly, the U.S. consumer remains strong.", "Operating revenue grew 6% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative three percentage point impact from FX. Adjusting for the leap year, growth was basically the same as the prior quarter. Overall payments volume, cross-border volume growth, and processed transaction growth were consistent with last quarter excluding the one percentage point growth benefit from the leap year. Cross-border continues at extremely low levels.", "Reported U.S. payments volume growth was 11%. International payments volume growth was 14%. Cross-border volume growth was 5%. Processed transactions grew 9%. And more recently, in April through the 14th, so recognize this is a short period of time, we're seeing similar trends, with U.S. payments volume growth at 10%, cross-border volume growth of 5%, and processed transactions growth of 8%. The bottom line is we continue to see reasonable growth rates but well below what we can produce in a more favorable macroeconomic environment.", "We issued a press release today regarding the Visa Europe transaction. As we discussed the transaction with the European Commission, we received feedback from them regarding the earnout. Based on that feedback, we and Visa Europe have reached a preliminary agreement to eliminate the entire earnout. Instead of an earnout, we will pay an additional \u20ac750 million at closing and \u20ac1 billion plus 4% interest payable on the third anniversary of the closing, for a total consideration of \u20ac1.750 billion plus interest.", "The transaction remains subject to negotiation of a definitive document and approval of the European Commission. It's possible that we could close the transaction towards the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of our third fiscal quarter. We think this is a good outcome for both parties.", "We've had many months now to work with the VE team up close and feel terrific about our future together, and we obviously know more now than we knew when we first agreed to the deal. Transition planning is well underway, and we have great confidence in our ability to execute this well. Given the delay in closing, we won't be providing more detailed information on this call. The basic thesis still stands, low single-digit accretion in the first full year, growing to high single digits by 2020. These numbers exclude transition costs. Next quarter we will provide more detail on what to expect after we close.", "A couple of words on China, there's no real update regarding the timing regarding of our ability to apply for a domestic license, but we have been making preparations to both make our application as well as be in a position to compete domestically. China continues to be a very important market us. We're committed to having a broader business in China that we will build over a long term, and we continue to invest locally in the country.", "We announced several important partnerships this past quarter, which are great representations of our commitment to create local Chinese partnerships. First, we signed an MOU with China UnionPay, where we both agreed to collaborate on payment security, innovation, and financial inclusion. We're excited to work in partnership with CUP to lead the industry forward. The agreement provides an important platform for the two of us to work together to strengthen and create new value for the bankcard ecosystem, benefiting consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and technology partners.", "We've also been active committing Visa resources to support the Chinese government's efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive finance. We announced a partnership with the China Foundation for Development of Financial Education and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to help support progress against these goals.", "And at the end of March, we signed a cooperation plan with the China National Tourism Administration, establishing Visa as a strategic partner of the U.S. China Tourism Year. This collaboration between CNTA, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Visa will result in a year-long series of events designed to enhance tourism, trade cooperation, and cultural understanding between China and the United States.", "On to some updates on client activity; in the United States, the Navy Federal Credit Union, the world's largest credit union and one of our most important clients in the U.S., renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Visa. We're very proud of our association with this great institution. Beginning June 20, Visa cards will be exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients across the globe. Banco do Brasil, the oldest and largest bank in South America, renewed a multiyear credit agreement. And in India, SBI Card, the State Bank of India's credit card venture, renewed a multiyear credit card agreement as well.", "We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see with Visa Checkout. We have nearly 12 million registered users in 16 countries and over 675 national institution partners participating globally. Later this year, Visa Checkout will be available to merchants and consumers in six additional markets, including France, India, Ireland, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $113 billion in addressable volume. Visa Checkout customers are also more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers.", "In February, we launched Visa Developer Platform, an open platform that provides access to hundreds of Visa APIs and software department kits for some of Visa's most popular payment products and capabilities. It's still very early days, but we've had strong interest early on in the Visa Developer Platform, with thousands of new users building and testing new applications in our sandbox. We have a small number of clients in or near production launch on the platform, and we expect to see more soon.", "Let me just give you a simple example of how the platform changes the way we work with our clients. Earlier this year, one of our largest clients outside the U.S. sent a small team to our office in San Francisco with an idea. They wanted to give their cardholders complete control over when and where their cards worked via their mobile app, the ability to turn their Visa card on or off for certain types of merchants or transactions. Working with our team and our new APIs, they designed, built, and launched a working prototype in three days and were ready to be in market in a few weeks. Before Visa Developer Platform, this would have taken months.", "I'll move on and talk about EMV for a second. Six months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from mag stripe to chip. More than 265 million Visa chip cards were issued as of March of 2016, making the U.S. the largest chip card market in the world and larger than the UK and Brazil combined. 47% of credit cards and 30% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, or roughly 20% of all merchants. Based on client surveys, we expect 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar year 2016.", "One of the main pain points in moving to chip is the additional time it takes to complete a transaction due to the time the card spends in the terminal. Earlier this week, Visa announced the launch of Quick Chip for EMV. The upgrade streamlines the processing of a chip card transaction to enable customers to dip and remove their EMV chip card from the terminal without waiting for the transaction to be finalized, allowing the consumer to put away their card in typically two seconds or less. The enhancement requires only a simple software update to the merchant's card terminal or point-of-sale system. Quick Chip is available free of charge to payment processors, acquiring banks, and other networks to offer to merchants. Several merchant processors and vendors plan to offer Quick Chip to their merchant clients in the coming months, including TSYS, Ingenico, Verifone, Equinox, and V2.", "Before I turn the call back to Vasant, I want to say a few words about the back half of the year and our guidance. Vasant will walk through the specifics of the changes in our guidance, but a few quick comments. We've not seen improvement in the global economic environment. Relative strength of currency pairs is still unfavorable for us, and the price of oil has remained at low levels. As we discussed last quarter on our earnings call, our guidance assumed that these things would improve.", "Since we're now in the third quarter, we're far less comfortable that volumes will meaningfully change, so we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance, especially the third quarter. We could be wrong. We don't know what the global economy will look like beyond tomorrow. It could improve. And when things improve, we will be the beneficiaries. But as of today, with a few exceptions, our business volume growth is not accelerating or decelerating, but we're obviously still seeing meaningful growth.", "We do know that there will be a turn at some point for the better. We just don't know when. So our mindset continues to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds discussed earlier, but the long-term fundamentals of our business model remain strong, and our focus is on accelerating global electronic payments. Globally, an estimated 43% of all consumer payments today are still made with cash, which leaves us an enormous opportunity in addition to the growth that we see due to regular economic growth for PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditure]. Last week Visa published a white paper, located on our website, discussing the opportunities to accelerate the growth of global acceptance, and I encourage you to take a look at that paper. It's why we feel good about the work we've done. There's still great opportunity in front of us.", "With that, I will turn it over to Vasant.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Charlie.", "Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight; first, net revenues grew 9% in constant dollars, with an expected three-point drag from the strong dollar. Nominal revenue grew 6%. The one-point step up in the growth rate relative to the first quarter was mostly due to the leap year effect.", "Cross-border business was once again very weak but in line with the first quarter's growth rate. The deceleration of outbound commerce from China continues. Cross-border commerce out of commodity-based economies remained anemic. This has added to the negative effects of the strong dollar, especially on our large inbound U.S. business. However, currency volatilities were higher than the first quarter, offsetting some cross-border weakness.", "Through the first six months, we managed our expense growth to 4% in nominal terms, well below the high single-digit rate we had planned in the first half. We have continued to hold the line on expenses while funding all our key growth initiatives, such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer Platform, and others.", "During the quarter, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash payment for Visa Europe. As these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are mark to market, with gains or losses recorded in non-operating income. We recorded a $160 million gain, which we have excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. These contracts are expiring in late April. When it became apparent that the Visa Europe transaction would not close before then, we entered into fully offsetting contracts at the end of March, locking in this gain. Coincidentally, this gain is almost equal to our interest expense in the quarter.", "Lastly, we repurchased 24.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $72.23 per share, for a total of $1.8 billion. Year to date, we have bought back 49.9 million shares at an average price of $75.47, for $3.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining stock buyback authorization of $4 billion.", "Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers; note that all growth rates are about a point higher due to the leap year effect. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 12%. Despite considerable uncertainty and turbulence in the global economy, payments volume growth globally has been remarkably stable. U.S. payments volume grew 11%, with both credit and debit growing at the same rate. Accounting for conversions and the leap day, U.S. payments volume growth was slightly lower than the first quarter.", "International payments volume grew 14% in constant dollars, consistent with the last quarter. Once again, the impact of the strong dollar reduced nominal growth in international payments volume to a paltry 4%.", "Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars and were flat in nominal dollars. When you factor in the leap year, the trend was unchanged from the first quarter. Cross-border growth rates in constant dollars have decelerated from 9% in fiscal year 2014 to 17% last year, down to 4% so far this year. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the first leg down was driven by the strong dollar. And then starting in September last year, growth decelerated sharply due to China and the commodity price collapse.", "Cross-border commerce outbound from China has dropped from growth rates above 40% a year ago to single-digit levels in the second quarter. Commodity-based economies across Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa have also experienced sharp declines. This has hit our large U.S. cross-border acquiring business hard. Commerce into Europe has been strong, though we do not benefit fully from it yet. More recently, we have seen commerce outbound from Europe into the U.S. pick up.", "Processed transactions totaled $18.5 billion in the quarter, up 9%. Both U.S. and international growth at 12% and 1% respectively were stable. Processed transaction growth rates will step up in the back half of the year as we begin to lap last year's transfer of domestic processing in Russia to NSPK.", "Service revenues grew 8%, in excess of nominal payments volume growth of 5%. The pricing we took last year contributed three points to the growth rate. Next quarter we will lap the price increases, and this three-point tailwind will no longer help us. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with processed transactions.", "International revenues grew 8%. Constant dollar cross-border volume growth of 5% was almost entirely offset by the currency translation drag. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the pricing actions from last year. Currency volatilities were high in the quarter but only contributed modestly to growth, as we are now beginning to lap high volatilities from last year. Next quarter our reported international revenue growth rate will no longer benefit from the price increases. And as I mentioned, currency volatilities were unusually high in the second half of 2015. As such, going forward, reported international revenue growth will depend on the interplay between volume growth and the currency translation drag.", "Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payments volumes. Incentives were generally in line with our expectations, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher U.S. incentives due to acceleration of deals into the quarter were offset by lower incentives outside the U.S. due to lower volumes.", "With expense growth in the mid-single digits, a tax rate of 30.1%, EPS of $0.68 after adjusting for the gain from our currency forward contracts, grew by 12% in constant dollars, and by a healthy 17% when you account for the interest on the debt we issued to finance the Visa Europe acquisition.", "With that, let me turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter and the balance of the year, which excludes the impact from Visa Europe. We now expect net revenue growth in fiscal 2016 to come in at 7% to 8% in constant dollars, a couple of points below our expectations from last October. This is driven by three factors: first, no improvement in cross-border volume growth from current levels; second, somewhat weaker domestic payment volumes due to gas prices as well as weakness in large commodity-based economies like Brazil; third, client incentives likely to come in at the high end of our 17.5% to 18.5% range.", "In October last year, as we told you on our call, we had hoped that cross-border trends would improve as we lapped the weakening of the dollar in the second half of fiscal 2015. However, cross-border growth dropped from the 8% range to the 4% range in the past six to nine months, as outbound commerce from China and commodity economies slowed sharply. This trend continues. As such, we are assuming little improvement in the cross-border growth rate in the second half. Recent weakness in the dollar should help over time, but it is too early to tell.", "We have now lapped the sharp gas declines from last year. Last October, we had hoped that this would provide a tailwind for U.S. domestic volumes in the second half of fiscal 2016. This has not happened, as gas prices remain below the lows of last year. Given the recent failure of OPEC to agree on production caps, lower gas prices could persist. As such, we are assuming that U.S. payment volume growth will not improve from current trends in the second half. In addition, payments volumes remain soft in large commodity economies like Brazil and the Middle East.", "Client incentives are projected to come in at the high end of our guidance range. In the first half, client incentives were around 18% of gross revenue. In the second half, we are likely to run at around 19%. Significant renewals and conversions are driving this trend, particularly in the U.S. Costco and USAA add more than 50 basis points to incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second half.", "A few other factors to highlight, these are not new but will impact reported revenue growth numbers in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we will no longer benefit from the uplift in our growth rate we got from the price increases last year. We will lap the currency volatility peaks of the second half of 2015. There have been some delays in the rollout of USAA and Costco conversions. Given the quarter lag in recording service revenues, these Costco and USAA conversions are a drag on net revenues in the second half of 2016. In other words, incentive expense exceeded revenue recognized. This will of course not be the case in fiscal 2017. On the positive front, if the recent weakness in the dollar continues, the currency translation drag of three points could moderate.", "Given softer than expected revenues, we will continue to hold the line on expenses, funding key strategic and growth programs while maintaining or reducing costs in other areas. As we had indicated previously, expense growth will be lower in the second half relative to the first half rate.", "We expect a modestly lower tax rate of about 30% versus the low 30%, which will also help mitigate impact on net income.", "As you look at the fiscal third quarter, net revenue growth in nominal terms could come in as low as 2% to 3%. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, we will lap an unusually low quarter for incentives in Q3 last year. Incentives were 16% of gross revenues due to deal delays versus an anticipated 19% this year. As we have told you before, incentive shifts from quarter to quarter can impact year-over-year comparisons. Nominal net revenue growth should revert back to the first half growth rate in Q4.", "With a lower revenue growth range and including interest expense from the $16 billion in debt we issued last December, we now expect constant currency EPS growth in the low double digits. Interest expense will cost us over $0.09 this year, or almost four points of EPS growth. If you account for the interest expense, it puts constant currency EPS growth at the low end of the mid-teens range. The currency translation drag is approximately four points.", "In terms of the impact of Visa Europe, for modeling purposes, we think it is best to assume the transaction does not close in our fiscal third quarter. As such, we will have interest expense in the third quarter but no operating income from Visa Europe to offset it. Should we close on the acquisition sooner, we will of course break out the impact. If Visa Europe is in our numbers for the full fourth quarter, in rough terms it will offset interest cost in the quarter. There will of course be a variety of non-recurring transaction related costs, which will also break out. We hope to give you a more precise perspective when we talk again in July.", "As we look ahead to 2017, we remain optimistic that revenue growth rates will step up from current levels. We will begin to see the impact of Costco and USAA conversions kick in, and hopefully we will see some recovery in the cross-border business and gas prices, helped by a weakening dollar. Nominal dollar growth could also pick up as the dollar drag abates. Visa Europe will provide additional ballast, driving EPS growth back to levels you expect us to deliver.", "With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Vasant. I got it right that time. Sam, at this point we are ready to start taking questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. So it sounds, Vasant, like you're saying that the revenue weakness comes from the rebound that you were hoping for not really happening. I'm wondering. Can you talk a little bit? You mentioned the tax rate, but it seems like even including the interest expense that the impact on net income is actually fairly nominal. Are there other things going on, and can you talk a little bit about what you're doing to preserve or protect net income?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "As we've been doing most of this year, we are holding the line on expenses. I think when we talked to you last October, we had indicated that the expense growth would run I think in the high single digits in the first half and then moderate in the second half. It has, as you can see, run below that in the first half, and we said that the rate will be even lower in the second half. So clearly we are trying to mitigate some of the revenue softness with expense management. And then the tax rate is modestly lower than we might have expected last year. So those two things are mitigating the impact on EPS, but not completely. But other than that, really, those are the main pluses and minuses. I don't know, Charlie, if there's anything you would add.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Yes, our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, thanks, guys, just two quick ones related to Europe. First, any other regulatory impediments that you anticipate now that you took care of the earnout? And how much would you expect Visa Europe to drive acceleration in the cross-border volume given all the intra-European travel? I think you had given some pro forma data on that couple years ago. So I don't know if the relative figures would have changed, but any thoughts there?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I guess I'll take the first one. So we have to obviously go back and get approval for this transaction. But as I had said in my remarks, we have gotten feedback. It's specifically related to the earnout. And so what we've crafted eliminates the earnout in its entirety. So as with all regulatory approvals, we need to go through the process, but we would not have struck a deal that we didn't think could be approved.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "On the cross-border question, if you go back three or four quarters and look at cross-border inbound/outbound, one of the strongest markets for inbound travel and inbound commerce has been Europe. So had we had Europe in our numbers, clearly our cross-border numbers would have looked better. What's it going to be like next year? Of course, that's a different issue, and we'll talk about it in the next few quarters as we discuss Europe. But yes, cross-border inbound into Europe has been a strong business.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you. I just want to make sure there's no other contingencies outside of the EC approvals, is there, to close this deal. And then just secondly, understanding it's a competitive market today, is there any concern that the removal of the earnout loosens the ties that the banks might have in the future with Visa Inc.? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So listen, on the second one, I think as I said in my remarks, we've had a fair amount of time to work with the Visa Europe team to understand their relationships with their clients. And I would just say that we would not have agreed to a deal that we didn't think was an appropriate price to pay relative to the value that we were getting. Our view is when you actually look at what the earnout was versus where we are today, we're confident in the value that we'll be getting and we will get the appropriate returns.", "And on the first question of regulatory approval, there were three that we initially needed to approve, Turkey, Jersey, and the European Commission. And we will revisit the first two to ensure, and we will go through the process with the European Commission.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. As you think about the Visa Europe integration process, can you maybe give us an update on the process you're going to go through in terms of identifying synergies? And can you maybe talk about any synergies that you might look for in Visa Inc. in addition to those in Visa Europe?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, let me start and then Vasant can chime in. The work that we've had underway, and keep in mind, just to be perfectly clear, as we have done our work since the announcement of the initial transaction, all the work that we've been doing is just pure planning. They continue to run their business. We continue to run our business. But we've been working very closely together to understand what the best way to organize and run the company is on a going-forward basis.", "So we've gotten to the point where we have pretty clear plans area by area across the company of what the expense base of an integrated company would look like, what timeframes would look like to get there. We have some more process to go through and we've got some specific processes we've got to go through within Europe to ensure that we do this properly. But when we first announced the transaction, we had done the work with some information but not the kind of information that we have had access to since the transaction was announced.", "So as I said, we feel very comfortable that we have a better understanding of what those expense synergies will look like and over what time we will get them in addition to having a deeper understanding of what it will take operationally, and feel very good about our ability to get it done.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think everything we told you then as to what we can do we feel very good about, have much clearer line of sight on precisely how we would do it and over what timeframe. And then to answer the other question you asked, would we look at costs comprehensively and say what is the opportunity when you combine the two both within Visa Inc. and Visa Europe? Yes, we would absolutely do it that way across the functions.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and so just to be very specific, there are some things where we look at what's being done in Europe, and we asked the question. Are they doing it better and more efficiently than we're doing it elsewhere in the Visa Inc. franchise? And if that's the case, which it is in some cases, that could survive and we'll get the synergies within VI.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's right.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thank you; next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, hi, guys. Just wanted to make sure. Last quarter you guys warned that if there wasn't a pickup on the economy front, we're likely to see potentially changing guidance, so not a real surprise here. But what I want to make sure is, is this all cyclical, or is there any share loss that you're seeing that's causing the change in guidance?", "And then secondly, we picked up some news that you guys could be increasing your U.S. acquirer fee on Signature Debit on July 1, 2016. Just want to see if that has any impact on the model and if that's correct. Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So let me do the first one first. So to answer the question, everything that we're seeing and everything that we've talked about we absolutely believe is cyclical. It doesn't relate to share in any way, shape, or form and we feel very good about the maintenance of the share that we have across the world.", "And you're right, I'm glad you pointed it out because we tried to be as transparent as we could on last quarter's earnings call, where we said listen, it's the first quarter. It's very early. We don't know what volumes will be two, three quarters out from now. But our assumptions are that in order to make those guidance numbers, there needs to be an improvement. And things haven't deteriorated, but things haven't improved, so that's playing out exactly \u2013 not the way we would want, but given what's happened, the way we would expect. And so obviously, if things got better, then that would change as well. But we just don't see that. And so it's not something at this point, given that we're already in the third quarter, we think is prudent to think about.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And in terms of the U.S. acquired debit price increase of two basis points, yes, we have informed people about it. They will begin to see the increase in July. But as you know, we record these things on a quarter lag, so there's no benefit from the price increase in this year's revenues.", "Also, just so that you're clear on it, this is not in any order of magnitude terms anywhere close to the price increase we took last fiscal year, so the impacts are more modest. It's clearly helpful, and of course we provide some level of remediation in the early months. So you should make sure that some of that is factored in as you think about all this.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Bryan; next question?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. So I just want to clarify. It sounds like despite the run rate for the first half of about 8.5% constant currency, the low growth in the third quarter is the timing of incentives, and it sounds like a little bit of a delay in timing on Costco/USAA. Can you just \u2013 any reason for the slower implementation of those, and is the timing for those deals now around the fiscal fourth quarter or early next year?", "And then just a quick follow-up on the incentive size. I guess when we go forward, had those been in line with the timing of incentives in the third quarter, would your incentive run rate still be in the midpoint of the range? Is that really what we should expect going forward? Thanks, guys.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "On the first one, it's hard to pinpoint it. And the implementation of the Costco arrangement is in a lot of respects out of our hands. Remember, they had an agreement that they had to unwind. There's a lot of work that Citi, the issuer, and Costco are working as well as us. And so given the complexity of unwinding an old agreement and moving forward on a new agreement is just complex. And in USAA's business, there's nothing specific other than I think it's them just wanting to do it in a timeframe which brings about the least amount of potential issues for their members, which we respect.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And on the level of incentives then, we are in the range we told you coming into the year. We are at the high end of the range. And the reason for that is we've had a significant number of renewals around the world and in the U.S. And of course, we've had a couple of big conversions. That's all in our view good news in that we are renewing important contracts and we have some significant new business. As I mentioned in the comments, the benefits from the conversions for sure are not showing up this year and will show up next year. But some of these, as we've told you before, there are timing moves from one quarter to another. And there's no question that the incentives are running at the higher end of the range because these renewals have mostly all now fallen into place.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Darrin; next question, please?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just say listen, I think to that point, and the reality is these are important renewals. These are very big clients and the new wins we've talked extensively about. And so when we talk about it in terms of how it impacts the numbers, if you just step back for a second and to the question earlier about share, we feel really, really good about what our client franchise looks like for sure across the globe.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Charlie, I wonder if you could maybe opine a little bit on mobile payments adoption, mobile wallet adoption in particular. It seems like some of the big banks indicated recently that it remains quite low and maybe a little disappointing. Are there any implications longer term for Visa's volume around mobile one way or the other? And how do you think about initiatives that Visa might undertake to accelerate mobile adoption which might benefit the secular shift?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I think it's interesting. I think we are doing as much as we can as an entity to insert ourselves in a way which benefits all of our clients and their clients into helping digitize payments in all forms of commerce, and that's how we think about it. We don't necessarily think about that we want to drive business from cards to e-com, to m-com, or anything like that. Anyone who tries to drive something towards what they think is good for them generally hasn't been particularly successful. And so what we want to ensure is that we continue to have the best solutions to pay in the physical world, that we've got the best solutions to pay in the e-com world, and the best solutions to pay in the m-commerce world.", "And so if you look at the things that we've done all across that spectrum, whether it's the things that you see, such as Visa Checkout, some of the things that we've done with third-party players, whether it's Google, Samsung, or Apple, or whether it's things that you don't necessarily see, like tokenization, these are all aimed at ensuring that we are a preferred payment option in all of those different mediums. And quite frankly, the consumers and the merchants are going to be the ones to drive the adoption of these different forms of payment.", "And so we're there to support them. We're there to be their partner. We're there to provide options. So the work we did on tokenization enables a lot of the things that you're seeing out there, but we don't prefer one versus the other. We just have to ensure that we're doing everything we can to be inserted into all forms of commerce in a way which is friendly for our issuers and acquirers.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Andrew; next question, Sam.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Matthew P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, guys. Just as a follow-up on the cross-border, what is a normalized run rate? Maybe first start off with what you're seeing in terms of what corridor is it. It looks like the Asian region is coming in a little bit slower. Then, what do we expect is a normalized run rate and what should we expect long term?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "If you go back in time, as you know, double-digit run rates were very common. And then starting about eight quarters ago, you started to see some slowdown, mostly with the strong dollar. And that dropped the run rate down to the single digits, and it ran at about 8% \u2013 9% in constant dollar terms for a while. And then in October or so last year, we saw that sharp decline to 4%, and it stayed there. The biggest drivers are significant declines coming out of China, and that has not changed. In other words, the second derivative on that is still negative. It is continuing to decelerate, though still positive.", "Canada, a major source of business for us in the U.S., has been declining for several years now. It has gone from a growth rate to meaningful negative levels. Then we saw a significant change in trend in the past few months coming out of all of the commodity economies, whether those are the African economies or the Middle East, big declines in those areas. And then layered on top of that are specific large economies like Brazil, which for a while which was a major source of outbound business to the U.S. and elsewhere; and other economies, like Russia, which you saw really slow \u2013 go down significantly last year.", "So you've got three things going on at the same time, which may not happen often. One is a strong dollar, which hurts the largest part of our cross-border business, which is the acquired business into the U.S. Second is a significant growth engine called China slowing down. And third is large chunks of the global economy having trouble, like Brazil, like Russia, for a variety of different reasons. So you've got all three things happening at the same time right now.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And just in terms of how it plays out mathematically is \u2013 remember, to the extent that the dollar strengthens, we start to see less spending as goods are no longer as attractive to buy on a cross-border basis. And so you're going from growth to shrinkage, and so on a percentage change basis it's significant. So the first effect will be at some point these things get lapped, assuming that it doesn't continue to get worse, and normal business grows at a reasonable level. And then if there is any kind of weakening of the dollar, then you start to see the spending patterns shift back to what they were, and that changes the growth dynamic significantly.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Sam.", "Operator", "Yes, our next question is from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi, thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I was just wondering, Charlie. Do you have any update on your conversations, negotiations with the aggregators that you had shared some perspective on last quarter? Thank you.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't, I don't. I think what I said is what I and we continue to feel. And if there's anything more to talk about, we'll let you know.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Sam.", "Operator", "Yes, our next question is from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi, Charlie. Can you give an update, a little more color on Visa Checkout? How many of your large issuers do you have now auto-enrolling in Visa Checkout, and are you seeing a notable uptick in adoption as a result of that? And then similarly on the acquirer side, do you have any acquirer partners that are actively now helping you promote Visa Checkout with the merchants? Like at some point here, should we be seeing more of a steep acceleration in adoption?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Listen, I think to the last question first, I think it's \u2013 we don't \u2013 when we think about what the adoption curves look like, we're not looking for anything that looks exponential necessarily at this point. In fact, what we want to see is we want to ensure that there is continued growth on both sides of the equation, so not just the increase in the user base, but the increase in the merchant locations as well. And anytime those \u2013 if those growth rates get way out of line, then we live somewhat in fear of one side of the network getting ahead of the other.", "So we have Bank of America who is very actively promoting Visa Checkout. That has just begun. So it's hard to draw any conclusions to what it means, but we love what they're doing. It is very simple. It's very creative, and we're excited about it. Beyond that, we're very focused on growing the merchant side. And the reality of the merchant side, Lisa, is it really is \u2013 it's merchant by merchant.", "And so we can certainly \u2013 we've done everything that we can to make it a simple integration for merchants. But the conversation really is, it's not even necessarily \u2013 it's not the typical conversation that either we or an acquirer have with a merchant where we're talking about acceptance or we're talking about an assistant treasurer. The conversations with Visa Checkout are much more about the marketing areas. And so that is where we are focused on is getting the conversation to a different level with merchants, and we're focused on the top merchants, not necessarily the number of merchants or the size of merchants.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Lisa; next question, please?", "Operator", "Yes, our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great, thanks. Good afternoon, just a couple questions. The Costco card has pretty attractive rewards. I'm curious. Does that change the incentive equation for Visa in any way, meaning your role in funding those rewards?", "And I want to ask a Visa Europe question just as part of the new deal giving up the earnouts. Do you get to then extend contracts with the major issuers from Visa Europe? I was just curious what the give-and-take is beyond what you discussed. Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. The first question was...", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Are we doing anything different with Costco because the rewards are better?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, no. Our deal with Costco is our deal with Costco, and their deal with Citi is their deal with Citi. And so we love the product that's out there. And even more broadly, we love Visa acceptance at Costco for all of our issuers.", "And on the second item, the answer is no, there's nothing special that goes along with contract renewals or anything like that relative to the additional amount that we're paying. But I think \u2013 I guess the way I would think about this is we certainly when we entered into the earnout, wind up with a point of view of what we think we could pay based upon the results could pan out. And as I said earlier, we've had the opportunity to be able to have a deeper level of understanding of what that could actually be, as well as to have an understanding of what the relationships between Visa Europe and its client base are. And so I just don't know how to say it other than I think we feel very good about the deals that we've struck, just as I'm sure their members feel very good on a risk-adjusted basis they're getting more guaranteed of cash, and so these two things meet at a place where you get a transaction done.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and everything we've seen and heard indicates that the current members and the current big issuers and customers of Visa Europe actually see Visa Europe as being part of Visa Inc. and one Visa as a big plus. Makes Visa Europe much more attractive from their standpoint with all the capabilities that we are bringing. And in any case, we had always assumed that we were going to work with every one of these issuers to move the relationship from a member relationship to a commercial relationship. And those conversations will clearly be the important things we do with them as soon as we're able to.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I guess I would just pile on a little bit and say, if there's a belief that banks have continued to do business with Visa Europe solely because of its ownership structure, that's a very risky thought process to go down.", "As we all know, the payments business is extraordinarily important for financial institutions. And as we pointed out on these calls many times, these are financial decisions about the network that they're choosing, but they're also far greater strategic alliances that they're thinking through. And what we bring is just a tremendous amount more to the banks in terms of capabilities. So the relationships that Visa Europe has are very, very strong, and what we have is additive to that. So we feel very, very good about our ability to compete in an open marketplace with others for the banks' business.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tien-tsin; next question, Sam?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Robert Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Vasant, you had mentioned I think just on the Costco incentives and the high end of the range for client incentives for the back half of this year. As we think about 2017, I think you said that we would expect Visa to deliver earnings like investors are accustomed to. And I was wanting for some color on that.", "And then is the Costco and USAA, are there portions of the fees that are one-time very large fees such that we shouldn't expect the high end of the range longer, that type of a range longer term, or should we think of the higher incentive range longer-term?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There were several questions there. Hopefully, I remember them all. In terms of the Costco business, all I was saying was that it wouldn't have an impact on 2017. I'm forgetting all the questions. There were several questions there. Jack, can you help me?", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "The first piece was what are the returns or earnings you would expect.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Oh, right, you made some reference to earnings. I just want to make sure that we were just making sure people understood that this year we had two big things going on that hopefully we won't have to deal with next year. One is we have this interest expense, which clearly did not have offsetting operating income in the timeframe that we expected, and that was a meaningful drag on our earnings this year. And clearly, once the Visa Europe deal closes, we will have the offset. That was the intent of the debt issuance. So that was clearly almost a full point of drag on growth, and we just want to make sure people were aware of that.", "Second, we have seen the headwinds that we talked about coming into the year. We are hopeful that they will moderate as we go into next year.", "And then third, the conversions that we believe will add some additional ballast, so to speak, to revenues really aren't helping us, in fact, are a drag this year because of this lag issue. So all I was doing was pointing to those things. We'll talk about it next year at the appropriate time and give you our best sense for next year. I think we were just highlighting some of the elements of this year that were fairly unique.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Bob; next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious. With the software solution you've announced for EMV chips in the United States, do you have an opportunity to roll out the same software solution across the other markets that already have EMV? And would you do this for free or would you charge for it? Is there some potential revenue upside associated with it?", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. First of all, on the second one, this isn't about revenue at all. This is about just improving the customer experience.", "And remember, around the rest of the world, I'd say two things. EMV is working; it's well accepted. And so we're addressing a very specific concern here as we go through this transition. And then the second thing is, in some of the major markets across the world, there's a very high degree of contactless \u2013 that's a card with a chip in it that can be used on a contactless basis, which are very, very fast transactions. And so we continue to promote that as well, and we don't have the issue outside the U.S. that we have in the U.S. as we go through this transition.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Next question, Sam?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, Charlie, so you've won two sizable deals with USAA and Costco. I was just curious if there are any other large portfolios or conversions out there that you're looking at.", "And then secondarily, it sounds like you're a little upbeat on the U.S. consumer, but the volumes did slow a little bit. Wanted to get your sense there.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so let me on the first one, and I talked about this a little bit. I think when it comes to our position, especially in the U.S., where certainly a lot of these big co-brands are, we love the position that we have. We aren't looking to gain share by being very, very active at targeting or anything like that. Costco is very unique. That was Costco looking, initially thinking about whether or not they wanted to change their issuer and their network. And I've spoken about USAA about how that actually came about. So what we're most focused on in the U.S. is continuing to do a great job and retain the great business that we have on the issuing program side.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And on the second part of your question around the U.S. consumer, I think it's important to point out that, I think to perhaps to everybody's surprise, gas prices today are actually lower than the lows reached last year. And in the second quarter, the gas drag was almost as bad as it was last year. It was at least a point on growth in the second quarter. And if it stays at these levels, gas is still a drag on U.S. payment volumes, almost not as bad as last year but quite high. So that's another thing that I guess most people might have expected coming in that you would get to see some kind of a tailwind. It isn't there, but it's anybody's guess though where gas prices go.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, but I think when you look at relatively stable growth in the U.S. consumer spend plus you talk to the banks about increased savings rates, you just draw the conclusion that the U.S. consumer is in very, very good shape. We can debate about the reasons why spend isn't accelerating, but it certainly I would say feels better than some of the stuff that we've heard. And the fact that savings increased at the right point when there's confidence, we feel pretty good that spend will move to higher levels. So if that happens, if the dollar versus currencies changes and all of a sudden our big cross-border business changes, these are things \u2013 back to one of the original questions, these are cyclical things that are out of our control.", "So when we look at underlying numbers of transactions and we look at how we're doing on share, the numbers are still very, very strong, and that's what's going to drive the business in the long term once we move in and out of these different cyclical trends that we have.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And just one other thing to add, as Charlie said, the underlying transactional trends are very good. And on the margin, even setting aside gas, a stronger dollar is mildly deflationary, as you know, which plays through into payment volumes.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "Sam, with that, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "And our last question is from George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open.", "George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I guess I'll ask a mobile payments question. And that would be, Charlie, any updated thoughts on the potential longer term to monetize tokenization and maybe bring us up to speed with conversations you're having with issuers about them running their own token vaults? We would appreciate any color there.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, we've been very, very consistent that we're not looking to monetize tokenization. Tokenization is a great enabler of different experiences that are out there. We think we're a logical place for the tokenization to take place, but we don't have to be the only place that tokenization is done. So there are some that would like to do more work themselves, create the infrastructure to do that. And we're working with people to ensure that people have that ability. But like most things, we have to compete because we are the right place with the right set of capabilities in a way that they trust more so than other places. And so for us, it's a service, it's an enabler, but not something that we're looking to charge for.", "Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations", "And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining today. If you have any follow-up calls, feel free to give Victoria [Hyde-Dunn] or myself a call.", "Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, speakers, and this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.'s 2016 fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year earnings conference call. Joining us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. The PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website as well.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements.

For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks very much, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us.", "Let me start with a few comments about our fiscal fourth quarter financial results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results both in my remarks but probably more importantly in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail.", "Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the fourth quarter. The results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included two special items, the $110 million charge for severance costs and the $88 million non-cash and non-recurring gain for the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%.", "Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected, and our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient. I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders.", "Let me turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the fourth quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3%, down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments constant dollar volume growth ex-Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% \u2013 when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the third quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the third quarter when normalized for Europe as well.", "More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 percentage point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized for Europe, and processed transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe. Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the two companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as one global entity.", "Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multiyear debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multiyear credit and debit agreements with Barclays and Nationwide. We have very good engagement with clients on our product and our digital roadmap, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially but things are playing out as we would've expected so far. And around rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multiyear debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer, Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China CITIC Bank. And in Russia, we renewed multiyear credit partnerships with Alfa-Bank and VTB24.", "If you turn just to talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries, and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices.", "We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamline set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices. For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authenticate their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase.", "Let me move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa advertising solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases, purchasing decisions online and in-store. Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest, and over 200 other media networks.", "We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to One Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June, and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and S\u00e3o Paulo.", "In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in-depth co-creation sessions. These are forums where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly.", "Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion globally for the period ending September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped $5 billion for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working with key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo Money, Square, and Green Dot.", "I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya, and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows a consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone, and merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro-merchants, local transportation such as taxi, and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts.", "Tokenization continues to be a very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service Providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secure digital payment services across a wide range of devices.", "I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017, but just a few comments from me. We enter 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wild card, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes, with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S., while Costco far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full-year benefit from Europe, which as I said, is performing as expected.", "Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners, and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than four years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We've focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises.", "The competition is strong and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves, but our position is strong and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa.", "Vasant?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Thank you, Charlie.", "For the full quarter of Visa Europe and our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues were up 19%, operating income up 15%, and EPS up 28%. We closed FY 2016 with full-year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion, and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84.", "For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note; first, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continue to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA. Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S. acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping.", "Third, we had two special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we're planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan. As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure and will make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a non-recurring, non-cash tax benefit from the reduction in the UK corporate tax rate, which reduced our UK deferred tax liability.", "Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.66 billion. We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year 2016, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion, at an average price of $77.13. This was approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued, and will continue into early fiscal year 2018, as we previously indicated.", "I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year 2016; then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY 2017. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN Debit routing this quarter.", "Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal. International payment volumes ex-Europe grew 9% in constant dollars. The tick down from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank that started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex-China, growth rates remain strong in Asia as", "well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot. In Europe, new regulations that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal year 2017.", "Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rates stepped up to 10% in Q4. This was the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year 2014. The weakening dollar is driving the recovery in our large U.S. acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013. Internationally, cross-border growth rate stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe, as the weak pound post-Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the UK", "Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. The small step up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past five quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter. Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe.", "We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued, as well as Europe's income and other one-time items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions, as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year 2016 expense growth to 1% ex-Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our Innovation Centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs.", "We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway, as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior year's is the translation impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions, and EPS accretion.", "Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in Treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past two years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals, as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017 starting with payments volumes.", "USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badge volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20% dragging the reported global payments growth down by as much 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact in the first three quarters.", "As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering helped by easier comparisons, a stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending down through fiscal year 2016 and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after two consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appear to have stabilized.", "The recovery in cross-border growth maybe offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we're resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year 2017. But as they say, it will be what it will be. With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY 2017 ex-Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contactless transactions in the UK in fiscal year 2016.", "We finished FY 2016 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues, approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year 2017, a 1.5 points to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year, and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings with Visa Europe numbers for the first three quarters of FY 2016 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year 2017 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year 2017 client incentives, as we replace these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives.", "The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year 2017. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives, and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year 2016, particularly in Asia. When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year 2017, moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1-point to 1.5-point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating, based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case.", "It has to do with our longstanding practice of layering on monthly hedges, no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies, but rather to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year 2016, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year 2017. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards are suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 points, 2.5 points in the first quarter, comparable to Q4 FY 2016, moderating through the year to 0.5 point in Q4 FY 2017.", "On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, and Visa Innovation Centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa, and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year 2017, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower cost locations. Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single digit range in fiscal year 2017.", "In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services, as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of Global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $80 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year 2017. These are costs to harmonize the two technology platforms. Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate platform.", "As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be completed until late 2019, early 2020. We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this timeframe. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next three years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out as we have in our outlook, however, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform.", "It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were intercompany charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa, Inc. These were expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa, Inc.", "The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was for network processing services provided by Visa, Inc. Through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016, these intercompany charges amounted to $191 million. Two-thirds were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement, and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, one-third of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel.", "Post the acquisition, these intercompany revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported fourth quarter numbers or will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY 2016 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million, as would your fiscal year 2016 baseline for Visa, Inc. revenues.", "In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around timelines for their decision for granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year 2017. We have made some assumptions in our outlook and will update you as we learn more.", "Moving on to interest and taxes, interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year 2017 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year 2017 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefits but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the UK. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low-30s range.", "As you estimate our fiscal year 2017 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the fourth quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year 2017, our bought back almost $5 billion more roughly at the same level as fiscal year 2016. At this pace, by the end of 2017, we would have bought back almost $5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks till we complete this program in early fiscal year 2018.", "With a full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt, with a higher GAAP tax rate, and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year 2017 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year 2016 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2 point drag from exchange rates, mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher than the first half, comparable to fourth quarter 2016 levels in Q1, and moderating through the year.", "Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year 2017 as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the second and third quarters when we had interest expense last year from debt issued for the transaction but no income from Visa Europe till the fourth quarter. Also benefits from our cost reduction actions start being realized in the second quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations, and we remain confident that accretion will climb to the high-single digit range by 2020 once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs.", "In summary, we feel good about fiscal year 2017. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing.", "As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish, especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatility could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year 2017 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we will update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Jack.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Vasant. Laura, at this time, we're ready to start taking questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for all the details, and I have a lot to go through here. I wanted to ask on revenue growth contribution from Visa Europe assumed in fiscal 2017. What's being assumed there? And what's the Visa Europe yield assumption as well? Do you need yields to rise in order to hit guidance? Thank you and best wishes to you, Charlie.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Tien-Tsin.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Tien-Tsin, going through your questions, if you look at next year, I think we tried to give you as much as we can in terms of what we see in terms of trends. So clearly from a growth rate standpoint, you have a sense of what growth in Europe has been this year. We are seeing, as you saw through the year, some slowdown in the cross-border growth rate. We're seeing some slowdown in the payment volume growth rate. But overall, it will be a decent year of growth in Europe, though not as high as we are seeing in other parts of the world or in the U.S. So that's Europe growth.", "In terms of yields, yes, yields are assumed to improve. Some of that we anticipate will happen from some of the actions we are in the process of implementing, like what we told you. The elimination of rebates and the replacement with client incentives and some other actions we're doing. So you will see yields improve. But as we look ahead, Visa Europe will be an integral part of Visa, and you will start to see the impact of Visa Europe in the aggregate numbers we report and what happens to our yields from the new baseline you have in yields and so on. So hopefully that helps. We tried to give you as much detail as we can on what the current trend is, and it will help you figure out what Europe is contributing as you look ahead.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Best wishes to you, Charlie. I was wondering if you can maybe just frame, besides all the details, at the highest level, when you think about the guidance for 2017 that you offered, when you think about that versus last year, whether you think it's more or less conservative than last year in terms of your overall approach. And can you maybe talk about what's the biggest factor about Visa Europe outside of the consumer trends that could drive that either to the positive or negative side, whether it be client renewals or anything else?", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "I'll do the first, and I'll let Vasant do the second. I think you should expect that the answer from us to be that in both years, we try and be as accurate as we can. And obviously, there's a tremendous amount of assumptions that go into this. And I've said this time and time again, which is you all put all this weight on what we're telling you 2017 will be. And what we try and make clear is there's a series of things that we know and there's a series of things we don't know. And the series of things we don't know \u2013 but where we're making assumptions, we try and lay those out for you. And quite frankly, you've got to make your own determination whether you think those are aggressive or conservative. But I'll tell you, it's certainly not in any of our bones and hasn't been in any part of Visa's bones since it went public to be on the aggressive side.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Just to reiterate what we're expecting, and again, I think we tried to give you as factual a point of view as we can. Our revenue growth if you adjust for the exchange rate drag, which perhaps you may not have anticipated without thinking about the hedging implications, and you might have seen the hedging implications in our second half results. Our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year mostly because hedging helped in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half. And all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing in high teens revenue growth \u2013 net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year.", "Visa Europe is tracking as we expected. We feel very good about it. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors. Clearly, the cross-border trends are heartening. And hopefully, if the dollar stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us. I think currency forwards are now expecting more of a flattening of the dollar, which is what we've assumed.", "In terms of the currency volatility front, that's a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we're assuming. But overall, I mean, if there is going to be anything on the plus or minus side, we have assumed that the European trends have softened through the year, and we've assumed that those trends will continue into next year. Hopefully European economies will do better than that, and if that does, that'll be great.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Just maybe on the incentives, obviously, they're going up a decent amount. Is some of it because you've had better success than you thought in re-signing some of these banks? And maybe, Vasant, you can just talk about how we should consider the trajectory after 2017, given this backdrop? Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "I think we'll talk more about all that as we get into the latter part of 2017 when we talk about 2018. But trajectory-wise, I wouldn't assume significant changes. Visa Europe is now part of the numbers, and that explains, as we told you earlier, about half the delta. And there's also this impact we get when we pull back the rebates. It has the effect of raising gross revenues and incentives at the same time. So Visa Europe lands up at a place where their incentives as a percent of gross revenues are certainly driving the new level. Beyond that, yes, we have Costco coming in for a full year. That certainly adds to it. And we had some significant renewals, in particular, Asian geographies. So this \u2013 you should assume that this is a level that is about where we should see it stay, but we'll update you as we get through this year.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "This may be more of a housekeeping question, Vasant, but historically, looking at page 13 from the third quarter slides, you used to give constant dollar growth and then adjust for the foreign exchange. Now you're giving a nominal dollar growth and then calling out the foreign exchange. I'm just wondering what \u2013 philosophically is the adjustment, because that's kind of an important change in the messaging.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "I think you're reading too much into it. I think as a general rule, we've gone through all our releases and we try to lead with what is the GAAP number and follow with what's the adjusted number. So you've seen us do that almost everywhere, and you should not read too much into it really. And also, the currency impact certainly is moderating, but I wouldn't say that's the reason why it follows rather than leads. It has more to do with wanting to lead with GAAP numbers wherever we can.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. Just on the quarter, you guys had said that the results were better than expected. Just not exactly clear what drove the better-than-expected results; if you could maybe highlight some things that drove better than what you guys anticipated? And then on Visa Europe, I know it was 13 points to 14 points of contribution to revenue in the fourth quarter, at least that was the guidance. I'm just not sure or clear what that contribution will be for fiscal year 2017 in that same manner. Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "In the fourth quarter, I would say on the margin, revenue was a little better, but expenses were better and the tax rate was a little bit better. So in aggregate, it was a little better than we expected. As far as next year goes \u2013 and now Visa Europe is an integral part of our business. We tend not to \u2013 we do not separate out our regions. So you would \u2013 so we would report everything on an aggregated basis and not separate out Visa Europe. It becomes more and more integrated in, and \u2013 it's best to sort of look at it on an aggregate basis. But we've given you enough so that you will get a good sense of what Visa Europe contributed, and as you model next year, I think it will give you a good sense of what Visa Europe will contribute to next year.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tom McCrohan from CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi, thank you. Can you just give us the progress of the number of the Visa European banks that you still need to finalize in terms of moving into an incentive structure? Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "It's an active process. It's well underway. We're happy with the progress. There's a well-choreographed process, which talks to a large number of issuers. So I don't know if there's much more than that we would say at this point.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Hi, thanks. Wow, it sounds like China is trailing expectations in terms of when you can get up and running. Could you comment on Mexico and when you think Mexico could be accretive to numbers? Thanks.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Let me just start with China for a second. I've said this, I think, over and over and over again. And so this will be the last chance I'll get to say it, which is China is a very important opportunity for us. It's something that we spend a lot of time on and we take very seriously. But it's a long-term opportunity. And long-term is not measured in months or even single-digits numbers of years. So the work and our thought process that we have going on with China does not demand that we're allowed market entry at any specific date. We've said we're committed for the long-term. We don't expect it to be a meaningfully different contributor to the revenue growth or the profits of the company in the shorter period of time because there's a lot that's out of our control. And so as we sit here today, as we think about our forecasting over the next bunch of years, we don't rely on China when we think about the opportunities for us to continue to grow the company. At some point, we do believe that they will pan out but, again, that's a longer-term opportunity rather than a shorter-term opportunity.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "There's really not much to say about Mexico. I mean that is an ongoing discussion we're having. And over time, if there are new developments...", "Charles W.

Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "I presume about processing transactions.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Yeah.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah. So that one's client-by-client, and we have some good discussions going on where it's up to us to talk about the benefits that clients get when we process transactions. And when there's something to talk about relative to movement in the marketplace, I'm sure Vasant, you'll do it.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. So just on cross-border, it was great to see us get back to double-digit growth organic. And I know there's a bunch of moving parts for fiscal 2017 in that regard. But are you expecting double-digit growth to continue through 2017 as part of your guidance? And then just a quick housekeeping separate from that. Can you tell us what percent of your European volumes are from UK?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "What percent of our European volumes are from the UK? Yeah. If I remember right, I think it was \u2013 from a revenue standpoint, we've told you that revenues from the UK were a little above 10%. So that gives you a rough idea. In terms of our cross-border business, what we saw in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, was a nice recovery in the U.S. acquired business. We also saw quite a bit of growth in the acquired business in the UK from the weakness of the pound. We saw improvement in the acquired business in places like Mexico mostly benefiting from the U.S. Those are some of the big growth spots. The good news, though, was from an issuing standpoint, we saw growth in a lot of places. We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity and oil-based economies, Middle East and parts of Asia also improving and China beginning to stabilize. So our expectation going forward is not for a significant change from these trends. You should assume we're hoping that these trends stay roughly about the same.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Glenn? If you're talking, you're on mute. Glenn?", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey guys, can you hear me?", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Yes, Glenn. There we go.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, sorry about that. A couple of number clarifications, maybe for Vasant. The first one, could you give us what the constant currency volume growth in Europe was? And then of the \u2013 the question would be also of the percentage of European transactions that are processed, meaning included in the Visa process transactions. And then, if I heard right, I just want to clarify that you're expecting mid-teen decline in Europe volume because of the co-badging issue?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Let me talk a little bit about that. I believe the \u2013 I think we reported this. I think we had most people report their co-badge volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being relatively untainted by lack of reporting, and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right, were somewhere in the 6% range.", "So as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world, in terms of growth rates. As you look at next year, the issue on co-badge volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badge cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badge volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is in France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian countries. If they don't all report, which is what we expect, we expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean, if it's plus 6% and minus 20%, that's a delta of almost 25% or 26%.", "Plus, as you know in the first three quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now, the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts we've factored into our outlook. So that is all factored into what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volumes will look odd. Although we report by region, so at least you'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing, and Europe will just look odd.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, Laura.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi, Charlie. As you're closing out your tenure with Visa, unfortunately for all of us, could you just do a brief kind of look back over some of the major pieces of Visa's strategy over your tenure? Particularly around the merchant side, just putting that in context of your announcement around the Visa Ad Measurement capabilities. And then also on the B2B side with the call-outs related to Visa Direct, and then the recent announcement with Chain around B2B Connect, and just how you see the progress in some of those major pieces of your strategy over the last couple of years?", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Listen, first of all, I think \u2013 and I really do believe this, which is it's \u2013 and I said this when we did the call last week, which is, I mean you all know as well as I do that companies like this are not dependent on any one person, right? There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done the day after I go, and with a leader like Al [Kelly], I would assume, will do it as well, if not better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past four years, or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think you brought up the work on \u2013 that we have really \u2013 I would describe as, we've really begun to do with merchants is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in lieu of any other client or any other partner, but just recognizing that everyone participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have.", "And so someone asked me last week if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants, and my answer was, I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year, to introduce solutions in the marketplace, which help merchants grow their business, and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by the couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships, and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing.", "And then I think just not because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question, I do think just when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about \u2013 let me say it differently. We don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the four-party model, but we are very focused on being as successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work of the Dev Center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital commerce, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those things.", "So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world but recognizing that we needed to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to \u2013 and I don't think about this as if we've done it and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot. But I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thank you. Next question, Laura.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Just a quick follow-up on incentives. I know you ran at about 18.9% in Q4, guidance around 21% at the midpoint. I guess I thought you already included \u2013 you were at a run rate of including Costco and USAA incentives already along with Visa Europe. The vast majority of it was already kind of the run rate in the past quarter.", "And then quickly on expenses, you're saying mid-single digit growth. I know you just did \u2013 again, you did low single digit growth in the year. You seem to have been able to accomplish all your investment needs under that rate. I guess if you could, just explain why we need to reaccelerate. Thanks, guys.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "I think mid-single digits has been our historic. And by the way, that's the expense growth for let's call it core Visa ex-Europe, the expense base you've been used to looking at. And if you look at the history, we have typically run mid-single digits. We are continuing to invest in all the programs we want to invest in. What we did this year was to prioritize around all the other things. As you look at next year, the run rate returns to what has been more of a long-term trend. The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. Some of the charge we took is a reflection of that. So that was in terms of the expense growth rate. So it really is a return back to what has been a very long-term trend, into level of investment we need to keep the business focused on all the right things. The other part of the question I may have forgotten, on the other one.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Incentives.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "On incentives, we didn't have the impact of Visa Europe in the fourth quarter to the extent that you have it next year because in the fourth quarter, the rebates were still in place. We eliminated the rebates only as of the end of September. And then also quarter-by-quarter impacts, Visa Europe brand are relatively higher level of incentives in the first half of the year, somewhat lower in the second half if you look to the filings we had done. So the full impact of Europe was really not as visible in the fourth quarter because the rebates to client incentive shift was not in place in the fourth quarter.", "Costco, we had some of their incentives in this year, but clearly it's a full year of Costco, so you see the full impact. Plus, there's a whole bunch of renewals that I talked about that really start flowing into next year, mostly the ones we did in Asia. So it's all these all together.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks. I appreciate taking the call, Charlie. It's been a pleasure. A big picture question, you've touched on it recently with your blockchain B2B announcement, but this is a big market. Your primary competitor has made a pretty aggressive move into B2B and hedged that maybe a little bit with the VocaLink acquisition. I wonder if you can just think about the way that market evolves in your mind, ACH versus cards and what the tradeoffs might be and what the opportunity is for Visa.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Sure. Listen, I think what's important is that there is this \u2013 and I'll describe it as really a government sponsored, whether it's official or not, push towards faster payments. And so when I think about ACH and we think about what's going on, I think that is the predominant driver because certainly the ACH system here and others around the world haven't been able to provide the same kind of level of service as you get from other products or other networks. And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about the position that we have with those capabilities.", "It doesn't mean that that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work, as you mentioned, in the blockchain space, thinking more about, where are payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer-to-business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market, and there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists and for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants \u2013 and it will be through consumers-to-consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, Laura?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Vasant, I just wanted to look one more time at the incentive as a percent of gross revenue. In the past few years, Visa has given us this range as basically with 100 basis points just like you've done today. I'm just trying to make sure that I understand. Does this reflect that there's confidence there? And what are the swing factors in that range between 20.5% and 21.5%? Is it mostly Europe, or do you have a lot of puts and takes in renewals?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "No. As always, you give a range because there are some things you know. The things you know are the deals that have already been done and what their impact might be based on the assumptions you're making on the revenue side, and as the revenues play out as you expect, then you get the incentives coming in as you expect. The variability comes from things that are potential renewals during the year or things you have to do along the way because something happens that you didn't expect. So those would be the things that take you to one end of the range or the other.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "And also to keep in mind \u2013 our incentive deals aren't generally structured as a percentage of gross revenues. Every deal is structured differently. Sometimes they're tiers, sometimes things are based on volumes. They're based on lots of different things. So we make a bunch of assumptions as to what we think will play out by client in a year, and it doesn't always play out that way by client. So a range really is the right way to think about it. And I just think the continued 100 basis point range is because we know a bunch of it has been signed, and it's just a question of how those bonds play out. But we do, as Vasant said, will sign some new deals throughout the year that will impact those numbers, and we make assumptions on what that looks like.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "And as we've said before, there's a lot of focus on incentives and trying to predict them from one quarter to another. And in the end, what really counts is net revenue. Net revenue is what we essentially keep and take to the bank, and it's net revenue growth that counts. And there's always going to be some noise in the trade-off between gross revenues and incentives, and there could be shifts from one quarter to another depending on when renewals happen. The number to focus on is net revenues, and we would keep saying that.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, Laura?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yes, Vasant. Now that you have closed on Visa Europe, I was just curious on your confidence level for the consolidation of the processing systems and if there's any kind of scenario where that could happen a little bit earlier and drive some earlier acceleration at the synergies?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah. So far we feel very good about everything \u2013 and Charlie might want to add some more things, but we feel very good about how the integration is proceeding. So really no surprises on that front and good progress and pretty much have achieved all the things we wanted to achieve at this stage of the game. The technology integration is also off to a good start. As we told you, that is a multiyear integration. It's too early to tell you that it will be finished sooner, but our goal is to get it done as fast as we can. The gating variable there is to minimize any impact on clients, so we will pace it to ensure that the \u2013 this is as easy for clients as we can make it. So we won't rush it if it has \u2013 if it's going to have a negative impact on clients. So that will be the biggest gating variable in the end. I don't know, Charlie, if you want to add...?", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "The one thing I would add is I think, I mean, I personally have enormous confidence in the work that the technology teams on both sides of the Atlantic are doing. We know how to do these integrations. And remember, what these integrations are is, I mean, this is really in many cases what we're doing is we're taking the systems that we have at VI. We're looking at what capabilities need to be built into our systems to accommodate Europe's clients, and building them out, just as we always do on an ongoing basis, into the VI systems and do it in a way where everything works as anticipated. So we \u2013 I mean, our team is extraordinarily professional. And I personally just \u2013 I think \u2013 I just have every level of confidence that they'll do that well.", "And to the timing question, I think this is one where \u2013 someone asked the question about \u2013 before about on guidance aggressive or conservative. I think this is one \u2013 we've been very clear about this, which is we could do this quicker. It's not a question of us doing the work to build out those additional capabilities. That will be done relatively quickly. The real question is what's the appropriate pace to complete these conversions along with our clients. And what we've said is that we don't intend to rush that. This is the type of thing that we have to do in a way that fits in with things that work for clients, and I think that's just a smart way. I think you would want us to think about it that way. We'll get plenty of benefits in the next couple of years from Europe and there will be plenty more beyond that that we should do this the right way.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "With that, Laura, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is from Chris Brendler from Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in, and best of luck, Charlie. We're sorry to see you go. I just wanted to ask a question on EMV. Now that we're a little over a year in, do you feel like it's been a little bit of a messy process in some ways, but do you feel like we've gotten to a point where EMV is gaining traction? And if you can add any color commentary on the rule changes relative to chargebacks and the $25 limit and how much that's improved the merchant experience with EMV, that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Listen, I don't have a lot more to say from what we've said on EMV. I meant to just give you the update on the numbers in terms of almost 65% of the credit cards and 45% of the debit cards, 1.6 million merchants, which is about 40%, are accepting them. I think it's a lot of work, for sure. It's progressing along a timeframe which is faster than we've seen in any other part of the world when they have moved from mag stripe to chip. We've said this I think last quarter or the quarter before. Today it's the largest chip card market in the world, even though we still have a long way to go. And you see the meaningful impacts on the reduction in fraud when chip-on-chip exists.", "So there's no question that as difficult as it is that it's the right thing to do. And it will just take a period of time as these tails continue to complete the conversions. And while we continue to complete the EMV rollouts in the U.S., I can assure you that we are working really diligently, as are \u2013 well, let's say we're doing this in partnership with everyone including acquirers, issuers, merchants, everyone in the ecosystem just to think through what's next, which is certainly looking at the online world but also continuing to look at encryption and new ways of authentication in the physical world.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "And with that, we want to thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations.", "Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa\u2019s CEO; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com.

We\u2019re halfway through our fiscal year for 2017 and we\u2019re quite pleased with the strong business results that continued into the second quarter. Similar to Q1, our business momentum was broad based with solid payment volume growth, a double-digit increase in cross-border revenue and healthy operating metrics from all of the regions. Despite geo-political uncertainty, our business continues to deliver sustained growth as we displace cash and capitalize on the opportunities in front of us.", "We\u2019re performing well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. I\u2019m excited to see a high level of business execution continuing into this fiscal second quarter where we saw robust growth in payments, volume, cross-border business and processed transactions. This growth combined with client incentive delays led to better than expected financial performance. We grew net revenue by 23% and adjusted EPS by 27% versus prior year\u2019s results. We also reorganized some of our legal entities including Visa Europe and created the Visa Foundation with an initial charitable contribution. This provides us an opportunity as a company to expand our charitable giving and our philanthropic activity.", "Vasant will go into this in a greater detail to highlight some of the normalized comparisons and also discuss the impact of the reorganization and the charitable contribution. We continue to work closely with our valued clients around the world. Well I do not plan to talk about renewals on every call. This was a particularly active quarter, so I do want to highlight some notable agreements. In North America, we renewed a multi-year credit, debit, commercial and prepaid partnership with PNC Financial Services Group. We also renewed a multi-year debit agreement with Citizens Bank and multi-year credit and debit agreements with First National Bank of Omaha.", "And on the co-brand side, we renewed an important credit card relationship of Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. In Asia Pacific, we signed a ten year exclusive partnership with ANZ Bank. In both Australia and New Zealand, we also signed a commercial credit partnership with Citibank covering multiple markets in Asia Pacific. In Taiwan, we signed a multi-year credit and debit agreement with CTBC Bank Taiwan. In our Latin America region, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, the largest bank in credit card issuer in Puerto Rico renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership. In Europe, we signed a PAN-Nordic debit renewal with Nordea Bank and a commercial and consumer card renewal with BNP Paribas Group in France.", "In addition to our renewals, we signed a number of key partnerships. We announced the IBM Watson partnership to help support payments in the Internet of Things and encourage the usage of tokenization. As a leading network, it is part of our role to look forward and anticipate. To that end and where applicable we want to ensure an on ramp for payments integration in the Internet of Things. This collaboration brings the point of sale everywhere Visa is accepted by allowing businesses to quickly introduce secure experiences for any connected device.", "We also executed the PayPal partnership in Asia Pacific, which is similar to our partnership in the United States. This partnership helps ensure transaction data sharing and provides consumer choice for an improved consumer experience. More recently, we announced the launch of an enhanced transaction data capability for Amazon business customers in the United States. This enables participating issuers to provide their U.S. commercial account holders a comprehensive view of their Amazon business purchases including full line item details on purchases made with their Visa commercial card that integrate with popular reconciliation tools.", "Our digital expansion effort showed great progress in Q2. Visa Checkout is sustaining tremendous growth, reaching more than 20 million enrolled accounts. Additional brand merchants are adopting Visa Checkout to improve their online shopping experience. And the growing list of over 300,000 merchants now includes Alaska Airlines, Avis, Marriott and Walmart amongst others. And our push payments products at Visa Direct and mVisa are continuing to expand globally in various markets.", "This past quarter, I continue to spend a lot of time with clients, partners and government officials. Combined with my travel in my first few weeks, I\u2019ve had an opportunity now to visit most of our top markets and I plan to get to additional markets in the coming weeks and months. During almost all the visits I\u2019ve balanced my time between meetings with investors, employees, clients both issuer and merchant clients and government officials. I thought it might be helpful to share a few overall and a few specific impressions from these meetings.", "In terms of overall impressions, the Visa brand and our reputation with our clients is very good. Clients appreciate the association with our people and our incredible brand. Regulation is present almost everywhere although it clearly differs from market to market. I validated what I already knew that the payment space is a local business driven by history, traditions and local regulations. The state of innovation, issuer relationships and acceptance penetration are specific to each individual country, so you must be local to win in the payment space. And my final observation is that opportunity abounds around the world.", "More specifically, let me highlight some of our ongoing efforts in a number of countries. In Russia, we have a very good presence and enjoy terrific relationships with an impressive set of bank partners both state owned as well as private. As a developed economy, Russia is growing domestically and in outbound travel, which contributes significantly to our cross-border business growth. Where Russia has a domestic processor and a domestic scheme in New Year, the government understands the value of other networks and we are working well with the government\u2019s central bank as well as our issuer partners. Russia is also building excitement for the upcoming Confederations Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup in 2018, which represent opportunities for growth in this market.", "China as I said before is a long-term opportunity. It\u2019s an important market and we will be patient. I recently enjoyed meeting a number of key influential people during my trip to Beijing. They were very helpful. That said it will take time to apply for and pass the various review steps before we obtain a domestic license. We are working on a path forward, which I discussed with key people and we received helpful feedback. Beyond the pursuit of a domestic license, the phasing out of the dual branded cards has begun to impact us in terms of payment volume and revenue and we expect to feel this impact a bit more as we look ahead.", "Turning to Japan, I\u2019m very excited about the opportunities. Japan today is a huge cash society with a large number of credit cards, but a small number of debit cards. I had a chance to meet with over thirty clients and the enthusiasm was very high. I really believe that Japan will take off over the next few years driven by a positive and an active government in terms of driving payments to be more electronic or digital, growth in contact list and the emergence of e-commerce. The Olympics in 2020 will be a great showcase for digital progress as the games are largely going to be in and around the city of Tokyo.", "In India, we\u2019re working with partners and government agencies to expand our presence. Post demonetization in November, domestic process transaction continues to grow significantly and was up well over 100% this past quarter. Today cash availability has largely returned to normal levels. Our transactions primarily come from domestic debit in low-ticket non-discretionary categories as we\u2019re driving debit awareness. We\u2019re also scaling up physical and digital acceptance through bank partnerships and new product introduction. Points of acceptance have increased 50% in the five months since demonetization and is now above two million.", "Looking at the European business, we\u2019re gratified with the overall performance. Our acquisition of Visa Europe has provided our business with a truly global presence as we operate as one Visa worldwide. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us we\u2019re pleased with the business integration progress to date. We are in active discussions with our clients as we migrate to new commercial frameworks with incentive structures. The vast majority of payments volume continues to be under contract. We\u2019re also in the process of building a strong and stable European leadership team. Following the recent resignation of Visa Europe, CEO Nicolas Huss, Bill Sheedy has taken on the interim CEO role as of April 1st.", "Bill is a 25 year veteran of Visa and is well known to the European team given his role in the acquisition and early integration. Bill provides invaluable leadership in business continuity as we integrate the European operations and while the form of search process is underway. We continue to work with our clients and partners to deliver on our innovation agenda in Europe and create new products, services and business opportunities. This past quarter, we met a number of successful contactless transit launches in the U.K. and Italy and Visa Token Service continues to expand with recent Android Pay launches in Poland and Ireland.", "In February, we launched the Visa Innovation Center in London and so our strong client engagement with over 50 client sessions held onsite to date and a significant pipeline of demand ahead of us. We maintained our strong record of accomplishment of delivering value to our shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation plan. We continue to make investments in our core business. We invested in our merchant service offerings by completing the cargo commerce transaction in February. The 3-D Secure 2.0 standard and detection provides greater fraud protection and will increase approval authorizations in a channel that has historically had high or a higher level of denials.", "In fiscal Q2, we delivered on our commitment to driving shareholder value as we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders consisting of 1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly 400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Lastly at Tuesday\u2019s board meeting, we received approval to increase our share buyback authorization by $5 billion resulting in a total purchase authorization of $7.2 billion.", "As we move to the second half of our fiscal year, we feel good about the momentum in the business and look forward to the future ahead. I\u2019ve enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many of our shareholders over the past months and I hope to meet more of you in the coming months. As a reminder our Investor Day will be held on June 22nd in San Francisco, so I hope you will be able to join us.", "And with that let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Thank you, Al. The strong growth trends we started the year will continued through the second quarter. Second quarter net revenue and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. On a GAAP basis, fiscal second quarter net revenues were up 23%, EPS including special items related to the reorganization of Visa Europe was $0.18. Excluding these special items, adjusted net income for the quarter was $2.1 billion and EPS $0.86. Adjusting last year\u2019s results for a gain related to currency forward contract EPS was up 27%.", "Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 2.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 4 percentage points. A few key points. Adjusted for the extra day in February last year, global growth rates in payment volumes, process transactions and cross-border volumes remained robust and generally in line with first quarter trends. Once again timing of client incentives added almost $0.03 to our second quarter results as some deal renewals were pushed out into the second half.", "We completed our legal entity reorganization of Visa Europe and other of Visa subsidiaries to align our global corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we have business operations. This reduced our reporter tax rate to 28.6% after adjusting for two nonrecurring special items. Finally, we bought back 19.1 million shares of Class A common stock in the second quarter at an average price of $88.51 for $1.7 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2017, we bought back 41.4 million shares for $3.5 billion at an average price of $83.81. Our board has authorized a new 5 billion share repurchase program increasing funds available for stock buybacks to $7.2 billion.", "Before I discuss our second quarter results and outlook for the year some more details on the Visa Europe reorganization and its impact. We are pleased to have completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and other subsidiaries. This has several implications. First, our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was lower at 28.6%. As a result, our full year adjusted tax rate will now be approximately 50 basis points lower than prior expectations. Next year with a full year benefit from the new structure, we will have a further reduction of approximately 100 basis points in our tax rate.", "Second, following this reorganization, we returned a net $1.3 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. This transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and as such was not subject to U.S. taxes. This return of cash precludes the need for us to issue any debt until later this calendar year when the first traunch from our December 2015 debt issuance matures. We have the ability to return more cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and we\u2019ll update you as and when we do it.", "Third associated with this reorganization the newly formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc shares, which are previously held by Visa Europe and recorded as treasury stock. The reorganization provided us an opportunity to achieve this goal in a tax efficient manner. The charitable donation, which totaled $192 million, was recorded in general and administrative expenses. There was an associated $17 million reduction in income tax provisions reflecting the tax benefit of the contribution. Both these items are nonrecurring and as such were treated as special items.", "Fourth, as a result of this reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recorded when we acquired Visa Europe in June 2016. As required by U.S. GAAP, we recorded these balances as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition to accrue for potential tax liabilities or assets if we ever sold Visa Europe. The applicable taxes are dependent on the geographic jurisdictions applicable to Visa Europe. In the reorganization, we changed our corporate structure.", "It is therefore necessary to adjust associated deferred tax balances accordingly. This one-time adjustment has no cash consequences as no tax was actually triggered by the reorganization. As such this approximately $1.5 billion deferred tax adjustment was also treated as a special item. Our press release provides you with a schedule that adjusts GAAP net income and EPS for these special items.", "Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter. U.S. payments volumes grew 12% with credit growing 21% and debit 3%. Adjusting for the extra day in February 2016 would add over 1 percentage point through these growth rates. Even after you adjust for Costco and USAA, credit growth has remained strong especially spending on travel. Excluding Interlink, debit grew 7% in line with the prior quarter when normalized for the leap day.", "Reported Interlink growth rates continue to be impacted by the lapping of a significant win in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Gas prices added approximately half a point to payment volume growth in the U.S. As reported international payment volumes grew 68% in constant dollars. In addition to the leap day effect from 2016, international payment volumes are also impacted by the shift in Easter from fiscal Q2 last year to Q3 this year.", "On a comparable and normalized basis, robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Growth picked up in Latin America and remains strong in the CEMEA region. Asia sustained double-digit payment volume growth rates excluding China. Payment volume growth in China slowed as a result of a decline in dual branded card volumes as well as loan restrictions lowering real estate transaction volumes. In Europe, excluding co-badge volume in all period growth was steady at 9% despite the leap year and Easter shift impacts.", "On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 132% on a constant-dollar basis, driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to prior year results, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was up 11%. In the last week of March, we experienced settlement delays in Europe due to a technical issue. This caused some volume, mostly international volume, which would normally have settled in March to be settled in the first week of April. This reduced second quarter European and normalized global cross-border growth rate by 1 percentage point respectively, impacts on cross-border revenues was de minimums.", "Strong cross-border growth trends adjusted for the leap year have sustained through the second quarter, held by the relative stability of the dollar and the euro. Once again, the strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from the U.S. into Canada, Mexico and the U.K. Our U.S acquired business improved, helped by an acceleration of commerce in from Canada and Brazil. As a result, U.S. cross-border volume growth remained in the double-digits and was a percentage point higher than the first quarter rate.", "Across other geographies, the UK continues to benefit from the weak pound, which is driving significance on inbound commerce. Outbound commerce from Russia accelerated especially into Europe. Outbound commerce from the Middle East continues to weaken, while commerce from sub-Saharan Africa is picking up steam. Cross-border commerce across Latin America was strong. Adjusted for the settlement delay, cross-border growth was steady across Europe. As reported, processed transactions grew 42% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable basis, which includes Europe in prior year\u2019s results, global processed transactions grew 12%.", "Adjusting for the leap year impact, processed transactions growth rates were stable. U.S. growth rates were modestly lower, primarily due to Interlink, international growth rate stepped up due to India and some new business in Europe. Even as cash available in India has returned to normal, transaction growth rates in excess of 100% have sustained through the second quarter. Through April 14, U.S. payment volumes are up almost 15%. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and process transaction growth was almost 17%. A word of caution: 2 weeks do not make a trend in the first half \u2013 then first half of April is impacted by the shift in Easter.", "A quick review of our fiscal second quarter financial results. Service revenue grew 17% in line with first quarter growth rates. Service revenue growth was helped by previously announced price increases offset by a negative currency translation impact. Data processing revenues grew 25%, international revenues grew 41% impacted by lower revenues from currency volatility. Currency volatility declined through the quarter and is currently below the long-term mean.", "Once again client incentives came in well below our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, lower than expected incentives added $0.03 to our second quarter EPS. Many significant renewals were completed in the quarter as Al described which will drive incentives higher going forward. Several important renewals have shifted to the second half. In Europe, we continue to work with clients to reset our terms post-renewal of rebates. We are comfortable with the progress, but given the large volume of contracts that have to be modified. This will extend into the second half. In the U.S., a couple of renewals, we\u2019ve previously estimated might be done by now will likely be second half events, mostly driven by client timetables.", "Expenses grew 24% after adjusting for the Visa Foundation contribution, which is recorded in G&A. As expected, expense growth ramped up from the first quarter level and will continue to ramp as we step up marketing and technology spend as well as Europe integration costs. Personnel expenses are impacted by above-normal employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance and several employees benefit costs that are seasonally higher in the second quarter.", "Our tax rate adjusted for special items was 28.6% as a result of the completion of the Visa Europe reorganization, driving EPS of $0.86, up 27% on an adjusted basis. Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal year 2017, as you have seen, the key drivers of our results payment volumes, process transactions and cross-border volumes continued to grow at healthy rates all through the first half. The main headwinds this year have been the strong dollar and the weak euro. Fortunately, the dollar and the euro were relatively stable last quarter, and this headwind has not become stiffer.", "A couple of trends are worse than we had expected last quarter and bear watching. Currency volatility is tracking below the long-term mean and well below last year\u2019s levels. Volumes on Chinese dual-branded cards are declining as cards expire and are not reissued. On the second half, we are assuming payment volume and cross-border growth momentum will be sustained. Client incentives spend is expected to ramp up with the renewals we just completed and deals that are shifting into the second half. Expenses will also step up above second quarter levels as we spend more on marketing and technology initiatives and as well as Europe integration.", "Based on first half results and current trends, we\u2019re updating several components of our full year fiscal 2017 outlook. We now expect nominal net revenue growth to come in at the high end of our outlook range of 16% to 18%, with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue at the low-end of the 20.5%, 21.5% range. There is no change in margin expectations in the mid 60s. As a result of our Visa Europe reorganization, our tax rate after adjusting for special items is expected to be 50 bps or basis points better at approximately 30%. Nominal adjusted EPS growth also adjusted for special items is now projected to be at the high-end of the mid-teens range.", "With that I will turn this back to Jack.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Vasant. Christine, it\u2019s time. We are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Line is now open.", "Bob Napoli", "Now, thank you and good afternoon. So this is the second quarter in a row where the company has materially exceeded expectations. What this \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a lot going on. What are the main surprises to Visa on the outperformance? Is it Visa Europe is a lot more accretive than what you thought? Is it a somewhat better economy, more market share? What is driving the upside surprises?", "Al Kelly", "Bob, it\u2019s Al. I would say number one, it\u2019s fairly healthy economies around the world where [indiscernible] in every quarter get fortunate where \u2013 when you look across the globe, you see fairly robust growth and that\u2019s what we had seen. I think I had said in the first quarter that we saw that with the exception of Brazil. Brazil was not terrific, but that are in the second quarter. I think the second thing is the fact that we saw more of the client incentives that we expected to happen in the second quarter are going to move to later in the year. So those will be the two things I\u2019d point out.", "And then of course, cross-border growth has continued to stay very robust. As you saw, we\u2019ve had now three quarters in a row where cross-border has been in the double-digit range especially strong has been U.S. cross-border, both issued and the acquired holding up pretty well. And that, as you know, is a good business for us. So again it\u2019s strength of global economies.", "Bob Napoli", "Great, thank you. I appreciate it.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Bob. Next question, Christine.", "Operator", "Next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Line is now open.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Thanks for my question. The lower 2017 incentives guidance, as you mentioned, is pushing forward some renewals that you thought were going to happen earlier in the year. Is there an implication that you\u2019re pushing out into 2018 things that would have occurred in 2017, because you\u2019re taking down the total 2017 number. And then I guess do you have any greater clarity on the potential effects of FASB rule changes on revenue recognition coming into effect next year, how that might impact this revenue \u2013 this incentive line?", "Jack Carsky", "Well, on the first point, we do our best to try to estimate these client incentives. We\u2019re in essence having to estimate 3 different things. One is the timing of when deals are going to happen; number two, what are going to be the terms of those deals once they\u2019re finally negotiated; and then number three, what are \u2013 once those deals are taking place, what \u2013 the actual volume performance is going to be. So it\u2019s relatively tricky stuff. That said, I think not only did we see some of the renewals we expected to happen in Q2 dip into Q \u2013 into the second half of the year. The other point is the one that Vasant made in his prepared remarks about the rebates being replaced by incentives in Europe. It\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of accounts, and it\u2019s simply taking us longer to get through all of the various work getting through the clients getting negotiated, getting through lawyers on both sides just playing it simple, taking longer than we thought. I\u2019ll let Vasant deal with this FASB question.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yeah, on the FASB side, yes, there are new revenue recognition standards. I think you\u2019ve heard us say that there\u2019s no real economic impact from it. We are working to clarify how those standards are applying to us. We are working through what that impact on us might be. There are two possible places in which there could be changes in the reporting. One is what is classified under client incentives versus what is classified under expenses, and then how certain kinds of payments are amortized on client incentive contracts. Once again, as we go through that and we get clarity from the SEC and the FASB on a couple of open items, they will be able to do all the work and give you some sense of it. But at this stage, that\u2019s where things stand.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Got it. All right, thanks a lot.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Line is now open.", "Lisa Ellis", "Hi, good afternoon guys. Can you comment a bit on your view on the impact of PSD2 regulations in Europe and more broadly the regulatory environment in Europe?", "Jack Carsky", "Well, Lisa, I think you know it\u2019s a little early to tell how exactly the PSD2 is going to play out. We\u2019re obviously engaged in talking to the regulators, talking to our clients and obviously having our own internal discussions about how things could play out. We\u2019ve been working with the regulators to make sure that the authentication process is done in a \u2013 with some pragmatic elements on it in terms of where you need \u2013 where you can use normal kind of risk authorization tools and techniques versus having two different forms of authentication, but where exactly it plays out is too early \u2013 I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell.", "As relates to balance the regulation in Europe, we\u2019re continuing to make sure that we\u2019re complying properly with the breakup of scheme and processor. It\u2019s being perfectly blunt about it. It\u2019s a bit of a cultural challenge and that we\u2019re being forced to separate people and organizations that were accustomed for years to working together. But we\u2019re obviously doing everything that we need to do to make sure we comply. And then broader regulation around the world, we\u2019re tracking very carefully. Probably the most relevant recent news came out of Argentina, where they have regulated interchange effective now at a 200 bps for credit, 100 bps for debit, but it will slide down over the next five years and land at 130 credit and 60 on debit.", "Lisa Ellis", "Terrific, thanks. And if you don\u2019t mind me asking just the same question, but for India, can you give a little more color on exactly what\u2019s going on the ground? In India decisions being made with the government with the central bank et cetera around how the payment system is going to evolve there?", "Jack Carsky", "Well, we would have expected sometime over the last couple of weeks to have gotten clarity. There was supposed to be clarity no later than the end of March on kind of the next chapter of regulation or guidance in terms of how things would have to go forward. And there hasn\u2019t been, and we\u2019ve been told that it will be delayed likely into early May. So we\u2019re right now continuing to make sure that we put as much emphasis as we can on growing the number of acceptance points throughout India, both kind of a traditional POS as well as using mVisa side and QR codes.", "And we made tremendous progress with merchant acceptance point up 50% in the country from November 8th until the end of the quarter. And it\u2019s still obviously very small compared to what it could be and will be relative to the population of India, but it certainly is a very healthy start from where we were in November. So we\u2019ll know more in May, but we\u2019re operating now under the pricing that\u2019s exists out there, which is 75 basis points, 40 basis points and 30 basis points depending upon the size of the transaction.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Lisa Ellis", "Terrific, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from David Togut from Evercore. Line is now open.", "David Togut", "Thank you. Good afternoon. How do your revenue growth expectations for Visa Europe compared now versus the time you acquired the business at the end of June? And in particular are there any countries you are more or less optimistic about from a growth standpoint?", "Al Kelly", "Well I mean as we told you before we are very happy with how Visa Europe has come along post the closing of the acquisition in June. In general it is tracking at or above our expectations whether it\u2019s revenue or accretion. Cross-border business certainly has been strong in Europe, payment volumes have been somewhat higher than where they were around the time when we closed on the acquisition. Our yields have been heading in the right direction most of the expense actions relating to consultation process are completed they are now working on the technology integration. So on all fronts Visa Europe is performing pretty much at or above our expectations.", "Vasant Prabhu", "On the second party of your question, where there is pockets of good potential? Our largest markets are the UK and France, and I think we look at Germany, Italy, the Nordic countries and Spain where we have a pretty good business already as well. A deadly place where I would highlight is where we think there\u2019s specific potential. But I think we feel very good about the potential in many markets across the continent.", "Operator", "Thanks you.", "Al Kelly", "Next question.", "Operator", "And next question is from Andrew Jeffrey form SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Jeffrey", "Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually a follow-up on David\u2019s question, with regard to Europe Al could you elaborate a little bit on the timing of some of the yield and expense initiatives in Europe. .It sounds like we\u2019re going to start to see maybe even a little more of an impact in the second half of 2017 and extensively into 2018. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can get order of magnitude maybe?", "Al Kelly", "Well I think on the expense side we\u2019re about two thirds of the way through what we want to do. On the revenue side we\u2019re probably a little bit behind where we had hoped to be a taking a bit longer than we had hoped to kind of work our way through the deals that have to be reconstituted. We got some very good momentum going now, so I\u2019m certainly hoping that the pace is going to pick up here in the third quarter and into the into the fourth quarter. But obviously if we bring on a good amount of those deals in Q3 and Q4 it\u2019s going to create a good run rate for us going into fiscal 2018.", "Vasant Prabhu", "On the expense side, I mean the next set of actions is all around the technology integration. So the first thing that has to happen is technology platforms have to be harmonized. And then we can act on what we do with the technology infrastructure. And that would be, as we told you couple of years out. And on the on the client incentive side, as we get these new deals done, certainly that is one of the reasons why the expected higher rate of client incentives in the second half as this pipeline of rebates and client incentives adjustments make their way through and get done.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open. ", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks guys. Research Division with personal growth still a little higher than we thought, you still had strong margins, I think turning it about 68% for the first half. So just first what would drive the margin to the low end of 60% range I guess average out in the mid 60s for the year?", "And then Al can you just tell us how you conceptually think about the company\u2019s margin plans I guess I don\u2019t guide in just for mid-60s, but just again as a CEO now, should we assume your strategy is to let operating leverage pass through up above 70% over the years to come or is there a different approach?", "Al Kelly", "Well I think that \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second half of your question first and I\u2019ll let Vasant talk about the first part of your question. Well we\u2019re going to \u2013 my view is that to the degree that we have good opportunities to invest in future growth whether that\u2019s organic or acquisitions, we\u2019re going to do that. And that\u2019s going to be the first use of capital always for us. And from my vantage point if that means that for a period we\u2019re investing a little bit of our margin to promote growth because we think we\u2019ve got an abundance of good ideas. We\u2019re going to go ahead and do that. ", "That said it is a high leverage business in the next 1,000, 10,000 transactions we don\u2019t really add much cost until we reach a point we got to hang another server up in our data center and we got a cost associated with that. We have very strong operating leverage in the business. And so to the degree that revenue continue to grow, the reality is that and the revenue has grown higher than our expenses because of our leverage the margin would naturally run up. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re just going to sit by idly and have that happen. What ends up happening is going to be a result of decisions we make relative to the investment opportunities that are presented in front of us around the world.", "Vasant Prabhu", "In terms of a question on near term margins, your first question, just a few things I just want to point out that I had in the prepared remarks. One is that you saw that our expense is ramping. And that ramp is partially in personnel expenses, but also as we get to the second half there is going to be a further ramp in our marketing and our technology based on some programs that\u2019s second half based. In addition to that the Visa Europe integration costs are also ramping. So there\u2019s a set of costs that are ramping in the second half.", "And then the second item is client incentives have been lower than the expected. We still believe that they will be in the range we gave you earlier although it\u2019s more likely at the lower end of the range which is higher than where they have been in the first half. So when you put that all together, it gives you a sense of where margins are likely to be in the second half.", "Darrin Peller", "Thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thanks I just had a follow-up on some of the emerging market discussions. Al, you mentioned your China visits and how the road might be a little bit more complicated to get the licensing. Could you just talk a little bit more about the timeline you\u2019re expecting and whether or not there\u2019s other opportunities in that market to work with some of the players that are proliferating? And maybe just on India just to what monetization opportunity is? Thanks.", "Al Kelly", "Well, on China I\u2019m not going to talk about what we think might be the best path forward. It just became very clear to me as I talk to government officials, that even if at this moment, we had our ducks completely in a row and knew exactly how we wanted to proceed in terms of filing for domestic license it just is a very complicated review process. And in fact not all of the necessary steps are actually memorialized. One of the things that I found out is that hopefully the Chinese government by the end of the second quarter is going to publish a set of more clarifying rules about international entities and what would be required to submit for a license.", "So this is Sanjay, I think it has been communicated in the past. This is a long term play. But I think we have to be patient because this is in a country of 13 million or 130 million people, it\u2019s almost 1.4 billion people and it\u2019s just simply going to take time.", "I think in the short to medium term, the reality is that the insistence, what\u2019s an increasingly insistence on the part of the government for issuers to move away from the dual co-badge cards is in fact going to impact us in a negative way. It will impact us more meaningfully purchase volume, but we\u2019re going to see some impact on revenue. That said, we still expect that many of our partners are continuing to \u2013 as we know as come up instead of obviously renewing with dual-badge cards, they\u2019re renewing card a CUP card and a Visa card to facilitate international travel. So we still believe that cross-border traffic from Chinese citizens traveling outside of China will continue to be quite good.", "Turning to India, again, I think this is a longer-term play, but it\u2019s a longer-term play that\u2019s right now got real wind at its back. And we\u2019re investing and we\u2019ve made it clear to our folks on the ground in India that we\u2019re behind them and we\u2019ll invest what\u2019s necessary to take advantage of the wind at our backs right now.", "In terms of how big this is, I think there\u2019s a number of things that we have to watch. we\u2019ll have to see where the actual pricing actually nets out when we get the final words from the regulators, so that it\u2019s \u2013 make sure it\u2019s attractive enough. We\u2019ll have to see how the government in India continues or doesn\u2019t continue to have this sustained push behind the efforts here. But right now and until circumstances dictate that we should do otherwise we\u2019re full steam ahead in trying to drive coverage, build awareness relative to mVisa and our app and trying to drive as many through marketing, drive as many Indian citizens into this world of using their mobile phone to transact for the purchases at least for their everyday goods and items.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now open.", "George Mihalos", "Great thanks for taking my question guys. Just wanted to build off of the last question as it pertains to China, and Al and Vasant, your comments around monitoring some of the China co-badge cards. Can you size for us what the potential impact could be maybe in terms of volume, for example, something that could be at risk?", "And then second question, Vasant, I just want to make sure on the tax rate, I\u2019m thinking about it correctly. For 2017, you\u2019re talking about a 30% tax rate going to is it 29% in 2018? Thank you.", "Vasant Prabhu", "I\u2019ll take the tax rate. I\u2019m sure Al will add something on the cross-border side in China. On the tax rate I did say that we get a part year benefit from the reorganization we did in Europe, which is about 50 basis points this year. And we will get an additional 100 basis points on top of that next year with a full-year benefit of what we did.", "As it relates to the dual-branded cards in China, we have incorporated that in our sort of thinking as we look ahead into the second half of the year. It is just something to be monitored. It is not that easy to predict. But we are seeing that the payment volume on these cards is declining as they come up for renewal and they\u2019re being renewed with, as Al said, the single currency card, which do then pick up some of the cross-border volume. I don\u2019t know Al, if you want to add.", "Al Kelly", "The only thing I wanted to add is it is difficult to tell. I mean the banks have been somewhat resistant to make this change, which has been a good thing for us. It\u2019s just that there is a bit of a push on them more recently. And I heard that from a number of Chinese bank executives when I was over there. But how quickly it moves is hard to tell. It\u2019s also just hard to tell what we\u2019ll happen with single Visa card issuance in essence a companion card to China Union Pay Card. And what does any impact that has on the cross-border volume which is, in many ways for us right now, the more important volume.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Hi thanks. Just a clarification a question, just the client incentives. Is the guidance revision all timing-related? Are terms perhaps better than expected? And then my other question was just on the reported U.S. debit volume. I think it shows 3%. Some of that you said steady 7%, adjusting for Interlink. Just curious what\u2019s the outlook here? I know it\u2019s really complicated. Just trying to better understand what we could expect or see on the volume front and perhaps on revenue too with U.S. debit? Thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "I\u2019ll take U.S. debit real quick. The adjustment as you know, the leap year has an impact on it. And so that\u2019s one factor. Interlink, we have that lapping effect from something we \u2013 a significant win we had in the fourth quarter of 2015, that continues for I guess another couple of quarters. In addition to that, we had a few a certain amount of volume going away from us. So that was an additional factor. And then there was a small impact from some effects in February around delayed tax refunds going to people. So debit was in general a little softer this quarter than credit was.", "There\u2019s an ongoing shift in from credit to debit in the U.S. market. That\u2019s been going on for a while. So that\u2019s a range of factors, other than that, things have been pretty stable in the debit market.", "Al Kelly", "And as it relates to incentives, I would say that it\u2019s primarily timing, because most of the impact is on deals that are not done yet. So the terms are still not fully set, and obviously the volumes haven\u2019t started to take hold. it truly is kind of the $0.03 impact of timing that Vasant referenced in his remarks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Craig Maurer", "Yes hi thanks. I\u2019m sorry to go back to it, but I just want a clarification on the China co-badged card piece. As I understand, the co-badged card when it was used domestically, was picked up by CUP and when used in cross-border or was picked up by Visa. So in terms of the volume loss, are you saying that UnionPay is capturing some share from you in cross-border volume. Once the cards are reissued separately and that\u2019s why you are seeing slowdown in purchase volume.", "And the second question is now that we\u2019re about 6 months in, have you seen material success in your initiatives with PayPal to move ACA to over to Visa cards. Thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "So dual-branded card can be used within China, and it can be used outside China. It\u2019s CUP that processes the transaction in China. It\u2019s Visa that processes transactions outside China. When you we use the dual-branded card, if the cross-border \u2013 if the new CUP card that\u2019s issued is used outside China, then we would lose the transaction. But we\u2019ve working very hard with our issuers to have them issue the so-called single currency card, which as Al described as companion card, which we would like Chinese travelers to use when they leave China. And when they do that, we pick up that cross-border transaction too, but it\u2019s hard to know how much of that will stay with us.", "As it relates to the domestic volumes, there\u2019s a small amount of revenue we make on domestic volume. When we lose that domestic volume when the cards no longer are dual branded and usable in China, we lose a small amount of revenue.", "Craig Maurer", "And on PayPal.", "Al Kelly", "I\u2019m sorry what was the question on PayPal?", "Craig Maurer", "If you\u2019ve seen material success in the six months since signing the deal and moving volume from ACH onto Visa cards.", "Al Kelly", "Definitely, they lived up to the spirit of what we want, and it\u2019s a process that we\u2019re going through. But we feel good about the early days, and it\u2019s a ramp over time, and we\u2019ll see. But we feel good that we\u2019re ramping in the right direction.", "Craig Maurer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Keane", "Yes hi guys. Just a couple of clarifications. Just on the personnel costs, they are up a lot. I think it was 33%. That was up after \u2013 up more than the 14% in the first quarter. But I just want to make sure I understand exactly what that was. It sounds like maybe it was employee bonus accruals due to good performance. That\u2019s still a significantly higher number. So I\u2019m trying to figure out that number, what it was? And does that continue at that rate going forward?", "And just on the clarification on the second point on client incentives, does the pushout impact fiscal 2018? Or is it the pushout that impacts second half 2017? Thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "So I\u2019ll take the personnel costs and the other one too. On the personal costs, yes, client \u2013 I mean, incentive accruals were higher based on performance. And that there\u2019s a certain amount of catchup you have to do when you make adjustments for the entire first half. So that\u2019s a big component of it. There\u2019s always some pluses and minuses there. Certain FICA related costs start hitting you in the first calendar quarter of every year. Of course, our first \u2013 our second fiscal quarter is the first calendar quarter. So there\u2019s an element of seasonality as well as increase in some of those costs.", "So it\u2019s one big item which is incentive accruals and a variety of other smaller items. But in general, we told you that our costs will ramp through the year as certain costs pick up through the year. And some of that is built into what you saw in the second quarter, and some of that will continue. And incentive accruals will stay higher through the back half of the year too, based on what our performance has been, assuming it stays at levels we\u2019ve had.", "The other question was\u2026. ", "Bryan Keane", "That was regarding the client.", "Vasant Prabhu", "[Indiscernible] look, it\u2019s early to tell. You make assumptions on what\u2019s going to happen. And clearly, some things are already looking like they\u2019ll be in 2018, which we have factored into our thinking. But if you could more move into 2018? It\u2019s too early to tell.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.", "Glenn Greene", "Thanks, good afternoon. Just two questions quickly. Maybe for Vasant, I know you\u2019ve talked about the recontracting of the Europe deals, and that was part of the reason for the timing of the incentives. But more broadly, can you tell us sort of what proportion of the European volumes have been contracted or remain to be recontracted?", "And then another question that\u2019s not the same, but on pricing, how much of a pricing benefit did you recognize or see directionally in the quarter of that 25% of gross revenue? And did you see a full quarter impact on that pricing?", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yes I don\u2019t know if your second question is also about Europe. But as you\u2019ve said, as we\u2019ve said, I mean we indicated a while ago that we don\u2019t really talk about pricing actions we\u2019ve taken in any particular market. We sometimes talk about U.S. pricing actions because they are fairly visible to everyone. So we really \u2013 but those of you talk to people in Europe will get a sense of what is going on in that market. So from a price standpoint, there have been some actions taken and our yields our, we think, headed in a direction that you expect it to have them go. So that was as it relates to pricing.", "In terms of the process of replacing rebates with incentives, as we\u2019ve said several times, there are contracts in place, and these volumes are under contract. What we\u2019re trying to do is to make sure that these contracts are commercially competitive in a world where the issuers with whom these contracts have been done prior to the sale of Visa Europe when they were owners of Visa Europe, are still competitive. Because when they were owners of Visa Europe, are still competitive. Because when they were owners, they got a payment called rebates, which was more of an ownership payment. As those payments go away, we want to make sure that Visa commercial arrangements from a commercial standing remain competitive, so that when they come up for renewal, we have competitive pricing.", "So the contracts are in place. It\u2019s really the commercial terms that are being modified.", "Glenn Greene", "Yes, that\u2019s really what I was asking. I was just trying, where are you in that, moving all these arrangements to commercial arrangements?", "Al Kelly", "I think that we\u2019re in process. I think I said earlier, we\u2019re a little bit further behind than we thought we might be. But put it simply when you go get to each of these clients, have the discussions that are usually multiple discussions, and then getting it lawyered up, et cetera is taking a little bit longer than we thought. And so we still have a good amount of work ahead of us in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s the impact that we talked about on clients incentives move timing being kind of what our estimate is of the $0.03.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Christine at this time we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Okay, and our last question is from Chris Donat from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open.", "Chris Donat", "Thanks for taking my question. Vasant, at the risk of annoying you with one more question on incentives, and think about 2018, is the safest place to start about our assumptions of what 2018 incentive ratio will be, the midpoint of the 2017 guidance? Because it was more like 19% for the first half of the fiscal year. It looks like it would be like 23% for the back half. And I know it\u2019s impossible to predict it accurately. We don\u2019t know all the terms. But anyway, I\u2019m just thinking is the midpoint of a full year for this year a reasonable place to start for next year.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Well it\u2019s too early for us to give you anything precise about next year. As you know, these things are best talked about in ranges. But we\u2019ve given you our best sense of what the range is likely to be this year and I believe that gives sense of what the range is likely to be this year and I believe Jack has told me that the ranges we\u2019ve given in the past, while one quarter or another, we may be below the range, perhaps one of these quarters will be above the range. We generally end up being in the range for the year. And that\u2019s our best sense of where the current range is for client incentives as a percent of gross revenues. Beyond that, it\u2019s too early to talk about 2018. We can tell you more about it as we get closer to the end of the year. ", "Chris Donat", "Understood.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks Chris. Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has additional follow-up questions feel free to give myself or Joon or Victoria a call.

A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s call have been posted to our IR website.", "Let me also remind you this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website and in the Investor Relations section of Visa\u2019s website.", "For historical non-GAAP pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al.", "Al Kelly", "Jack, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We had another strong quarter of business results much like the first half of our fiscal year we saw a consistently solid trends in our operating metrics with very good growth in payments volume, process transactions and cross border revenue.", "Our global business benefitted from an overall healthy economy as payments volume grew in every major region. In the United States we saw strong consumer confidence continue to drive spending growth.", "After three quarters here at Visa, I\u2019m quite pleased with our business progress and our high level of execution. It\u2019s a real testimony to our talented and dedicated employees around the world for creating a strong culture focussed on leadership development, operational excellence and driving results.", "As I move to the highlights of the quarter, I do want to thank everybody for joining us at our recent Investor Day both in person and via the webcast. As the leadership team we enjoyed the opportunity to meet and spend time with our shareholders and the financial community. We hope that you find the information and discussions to be useful. We were pleased to have received quite positive and helpful feedback from the event, given the fact that we did provide a significant amount of information just a couple of weeks ago my prepared remarks today will be relatively brief.", "In Q3 our business continued to perform well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. We saw healthy growth in our key metrics for payments, volume and process transaction. Payment volume was solid across all five regions. Growth was particularly strong in India, the United States, Russia, Mexico and Australia.", "China payments volume growth remained low in the quarter driven by the dual currency, dual badged card run-off. But I should note that China\u2019s cross border volumes growth continued to be strong. This was reflective of the overall trend as cross border growth was robust around the globe. In addition to China, Latin America, the U.S. Japan, Russia and parts of Europe were among the areas of real strength. Looking closer at process transactions growth was driven by Asia Pacific, Europe and the North America regions.", "Client incentives came in lower than expected primarily driven by timing delays and variances relative to our European clients. This translated to financial performance ahead of our expectations for the quarter as we grew both net revenue and EPS by 26% versus last year\u2019s comparable results. Vasant will go into greater financial detail and cover some of the normalized comparisons to last year.", "As we mentioned during Investor Day the integration of our European business is progressing well and is on track. More specific to the technology side of the integration we are focussed on migrating the European systems to our global authorisation clearing and settlement system as well as deploying our global data platform and other corporate systems into Europe.", "We are well underway in that effort and we have just completed the upgrade of our U.K. data center is on schedule. We expect that client migrations to the new systems will begin by the end of full year 2018.", "In moving our European clients to VisaNet we confirm pride enhanced network capabilities greater scale, resilience and additional levels of cyber security that will benefit our clients and certainly be more efficient in the long term.", "We are also making significant progress in strengthening our partnerships and building digital capabilities to drive growth. Earlier this week, we extended our partnership with PayPal to include Europe. We were already collaborating with them in the United States and Asia Pacific to provide a better online experience and this now extends the benefits to European consumers and businesses.", "Additionally, they have joined the Visa network of clients, financial institutions and will be able to offer Visa accounts in Europe enabling consumers in businesses to use their PayPal funds to spend wherever Visa is accepted. The partnership makes it easier for financial institutions to offer their Visa account holders the ability to check out anywhere PayPal is accepted online by offering greater consumer choice.", "We also announced a strategic investment and planned partnership with Klarna, one of Europe\u2019s leading payment providers. Our planned investment is part of the global strategy to open up our ecosystem and support a broad range of new partners or helping to redefine and enhance the purchase experience for consumers online and in mobile environment.", "Klarna develops products that address changing consumer preferences giving them the flexibility and seamless experience that they expect and hope for when shopping online.", "In June, we signed 13 new partners to participate in our token service provider program in all major regions. With the expected increase in digital payments embedded in a growing number of devices we continue to build out a global network of partners to offer secure, digital payment token services in creating a more secure commerce platform.", "We launched the Visa Ready Program for Business Solutions. This is a strategic framework in solidification [ph] program to help technology companies that integrate with our B2B payment services to ensure that they meet standards and are market ready.", "Five initial partners in the U.S. have become Visa Ready as this program will help accelerate growth and enable new used cased for B2B payments.", "Turning to the international markets, let me first make a couple of comments on China. Yesterday we filed an application with the People\u2019s Bank of China in order to participate in the China domestic market as a bank card clearing institution. China is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing payments markets and is leading the way in payments innovation. Our commitment to this market is long term. We look forward to bringing our capabilities to the industry by stepping up our engagement with all the ecosystem partners to open a constructive collaboration aiming to create added value and introduce innovative products as well as reliable and safe payment experiences for Chinese consumers.", "We expect that the PDOC will consider our application inline with the publicly released measures and guidelines for PCCI applicants. India represents a large opportunity and we provided some thoughts during Investor Day on how we are approaching the market. We are seeing steady progress with digital payments despite the recent remonetisation of cash, currency and circulation is stabilizing as remonetisation comes to an end.", "The transition to the digital economy has been broad based across several categories including everyday spend and suggests wide societal participation. This past quarter we saw payments volume increase over 80% and process transactions more than double versus last year.", "In a couple of weeks I\u2019ll be in India for the first time since joining Visa and I look forward to seeing firsthand the opportunity that we have in meeting with local partners, officials and our team mates in India.", "Once again we delivered on our commitment to drive value for our shareholders in the quarter in maintaining a prudent capital allocation plan. We invested in support of the growth in our core business through capital spending and expenses. In fiscal Q3, we returned approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders consisting of $1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction.", "In closing, we continue to see strong momentum in the business and we are excited about the long term growth prospects to Visa. As we highlighted during Investor Day there is a significant opportunity to displace cash and cheque of $17 trillion in front of us. We will continue to focus on partnering strategically and driving digital innovation to substantially grow our business into the future.", "With that, let me now turn the call over to Vasant for some more on the financials.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Thank you, Al. Business momentum stayed strong globally through our third quarter. Net revenue and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. Fiscal third quarter net revenue of $4.6 million was up 26%.", "Net income for the quarter was $2.1 billion or $0.86 per share. Adjusting last year\u2019s results were several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe, both net income and EPS were up 26%.", "Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS by approximately 2 percentage points. A few points to note, global growth rates and payment volumes processed transactions and cross border volumes remain strong and stable. Exchange rate headwinds moderated, though currency volatilities remained below the long term mean.", "Timing of client incentives added almost $0.02 to third quarter results due to delays primarily in Europe, more on this later. We brought back 17.8 million shares of Class A common stock for $1.7 billion in the third quarter at an average price of $93.82. Year-to-date in fiscal 2017 we\u2019ve bought back 59.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $86.82 per share.", "A quick review of our key business drivers in the third quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 12% with credit growing 19% and debit 5%. The slowdown in credit growth from the prior quarter reflects the start of COFCO and U.S. AA Credit conversion in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.", "Excluding Interlink, debit grew 9%. Declining gas prices negatively impacted payment volume by half a point. Adjusted for conversion and gas prices, underlying credit and debit growth rates have been stable all year.", "As reported, international payment volume grew 72% in constant dollars. On a comparable and normalized basis, robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Asia sustained double digit growth rate excluding China. Domestic payment volume growth in China was impacted by the decline in active dual branded cards.", "Strong growth was sustained across EMEA and Latin America business picked up modestly. In Europe, excluding core batch payment volumes growth was 9% with strength across most markets.", "ON a constant dollar basis, cross border volumes grew 147% driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to prior results, constant dollar cross border growth was up over 11%. Through the quarter the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened moderately. Despite these shifts outbound commerce from the U.S. and inbound commerce into the U.K. remained very strong.", "U.S. cross border growth accelerated in the third quarter largely driven by out-bound commerce. The cross international markets particularly strong corridors were inbound into Canada, Japan and Australia and outbound from Latin America the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia.", "Reported cross border volume growth rates were negatively impacted by over three percentage points by an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of U.K. cardholder volume to the U.K. from another yield location.", "While this shift impacted our reported cross border growth rates, it has a minor effect on revenue since this is an intra EU move the platform made to optimize the European business. As reported, process transactions grew 44% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis which includes Europe in prior results global process transactions grew 13%.", "U.S. growth rates were stable, international growth rates were helped by India and some new business in Europe. India process transaction growth stayed above 100%. Through July 14, U.S. payment volumes are up 10%, global constant dollar across border volumes grew 12%, and process transaction growth was 14%.", "A brief review of fiscal third quarter financial results. With strong momentum in the key business drivers and helped by some moderation in exchange rate headwinds, growth rates on all key revenue lines stepped up in Q3. Service revenues grew 19%, data processing revenues grew 29%, international revenues grew 45% even as currency volatility stayed below the long term mean", "As I mentioned earlier, client incentives came in lower than expected and added almost $0.02 to the third quarter EPS. This was primarily due to delays in Europe. We are making good progress in resetting our commercial terms for key clients post removal of rebids [ph]. We are pushing hard to get most of the deals we want it done before the end of this fiscal year.", "Our current expectation is we will get 75% to 80% of the way there by September. At this point, we expect the remaining 20% to 25% to shift into fiscal 2018 largely due to client preferences and time tables. This shift in Europe is the primary reason why we now expect client incentive as a percent of gross revenues to come in below the low end of our original outlook range of 20.5% to 21.5%.", "After adjusting for various special items in last year\u2019s results, expenses grew 31%. As expected expense growth ramped up from the first half levels as we stepped up technology as well as Europe integration spending.", "Our tax rate was 29.3% driven by the geographic mix of our global learning and the benefits of the legal entity re-organization we completed last quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s important to remind you of three events that occurred in June 2016 which will significantly impact our reported growth rates on key metrics going forward.", "First and foremost and the most important is the closing of the Visa Europe transaction. Starting with the fourth quarter, reported growth rates will include Visa Europe and all prior year numbers. Second is the COFCO conversion.", "Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our U.S. credit growth rates will include COFCO in prior year numbers. In addition, the U.S. AA Credit conversion was completed in September and the debit conversion was finished by October last year.", "Third is the 2016 Brexit vote followed by sharp declines in the Pound and later the Euro. This will reduce the exchange rate drag we have experienced so far this year. This also drove the sharp increase of cross border commerce into the U.K. Also of note, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 was the first time cross border growth rates globally hit double digits in almost three years. Starting in the fourth quarter we will begin to lap the global cross border recovery.", "We have factored all this into our updated outlook for the year. We are raising nominal net revenue growth expectations for the year to approximately 20%. This is a result of the strong growth we have reported to date, lower client incentives at 20% to 20.5% of gross revenues and moderation in the exchange rate drag to approximately 2 percentage points.", "With higher revenue growth we are also raising a nominal adjusted EPS growth outlook to approximately 20% with a 2.5 percentage point exchange rate drag. Included in this outlook is a reduction in European integration cost of $60 million. Margin and tax rate expectation remain unchanged.", "Finally, a couple of updates on cash and debt. We returned more cash to the U.S. in the third quarter. Year-to-date we have returned approximately $4 billion back to the U.S. As you know in December 2016 we issued $16 billion of debt. The first tranche of this debt $1.7 billion matures in December this year.", "Between Labor Day and December, we plan to access debt markets to refinance maturing debt and an additional amount to fund the completion of stock buybacks that neutralize the impact of stock issued in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition.", "Before I finish, I have one more topic. A couple of weeks back, Jack informed me of his intention to retire at the end of this year. On behalf of Visa\u2019s management I want to thank Jack for his decade of contributions to Visa. As most of you know Jack was Visa\u2019s first IR leader as the public company. Jack built our investor relations department from the ground up establishing and nurturing relationships with all of you over the years and he has been a key advocate for Visa.", "We [Indiscernible] which he tells me may include running the town chairlift and Park city next winter. Not surprisingly he has picked November 30th as his last day. I guess he does not want to miss a single day skiing. With that, let me turn this back to Jack.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks Vasant. And before we start the Q&A, let me just add to Vasant\u2019s very nice comments there. It\u2019s been a real honor and privilege working for this organization and the people in it for the last 10 years. But it\u2019s always good to go out on top. I\u2019d known a lot of you for as ten years and some of you for as many as 20. And it\u2019s been a great ride and I really enjoy the interactions with each and every one of you. And so with that, Jenny we are ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Bob Napoli", "Jack I know that Visa stock has gone up too much and you are too rich, so it\u2019s not a big surprise here, so I hope to take the ski lift that you\u2019ll be running. But....", "Jack Carsky", "[Indiscernible] he doesn\u2019t need a lift.", "Bob Napoli", "No it\u2019s great, congratulations. But just, I guess I mean the numbers have been very good obviously to Investor Day I think the company seem pretty upbeat. I just wanted if there is a way that as you look at your numbers if you can split out the growth and tell has there been acceleration in the secular shift away from cash and cheques to electronic payments. I know there\u2019s a lot going on with market share in COFCO and different things, but I just wanted if you look at that, if there is a way if you think there\u2019s been in some acceleration in secular trends.", "Al Kelly", "Yes, if you \u2013 I think as I said in my comments if you start to take out the conversions and adjust for gas prices and volatile things like that, the underlying trend of credit growth in the U.S. for the last three quarters has been very steady and stable in the high single-digit, and debt growth have also been very steady and stable.", "If you look at our payments volumes through the first three quarters of this year, again strong and stable. We have been converting cash to digital at a pretty hefty clip for the past five years and I would said there is no \u2013 there\u2019s really no change in that trend. Global economies recovering have clearly helped of this year, so if you remember on Investor Day we talked about PCE penetration and PCE growth, the PCE growth component certainly has been helpful. And then the last thing of course is the recovery on the cross-border side. And Al I don\u2019t know if you want to add.", "Al Kelly", "Now I think the other aspect -- all what Vasant said is obviously correct. I think that while we\u2019ve seen a real adoption of digital we\u2019re still in the early innings. And I think that, as we pointed out in Investor Day when we get into E&M commerce we neutralize our largest competitor which is cash, and I think that's going to continue to be a real engine of growth for us as we look ahead.", "Bob Napoli", "Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Al Kelly", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Moshe Katri", "Hey, thanks. So another quarter of very strong results internationally. It seems that Visa Europe has been exceeding at least our expectations to almost every quarter since the transaction kind of took place. Is there any way to kind of get us some color in terms of where you seeing the upside coming from versus original expectations? And then, on top of that I think you've indicated that the yields from renewing some of that book of business has been better than expected, maybe some more color on that as well. Thank you.", "Al Kelly", "I think we\u2019ve been very pleased with Europe on a number of fronts, and especially given the fact that there's been a fair amount of disruption for the people who work in that business between the integration as well as the regulatory requirement to split scheme and processing in the marketplace. Our employees have remained incredibly resilient. And I think in general the European economy has been frankly better than we thought.", "As you know where our largest presence by quite a large measure is in the UK and the UK is held up well and as Vasant said in his remarks, benefited -- benefited from the lower value of the pound driving lots of inbound traffic into the UK, that certainly has helped. And when we look around the rest of Europe, our largest presences are in France and Spain which have also held up well. And then we\u2019re seeing countries like the Nordics continue to do well.", "In terms of the yield side of it we\u2019re still working our way through redoing of these contracts, as both of us alluded to in our remarks, its just a bit more of a slog to get there than we might have thought or hoped in the in the first place. But we are making good progress. I think we\u2019ll continue to make good progress as we proceed through into the fourth quarter and to the degree that we've got good incentives built in place and we\u2019re getting good volume growth, all boats rise, which is a good thing for everybody.", "Moshe Katri", "And Vasant indicated -- pointed to some new business in Europe? Is there anything substantial there?", "Vasant Prabhu", "No. I had said that on the process transaction side, yes, we\u2019ve been saying for a couple of quarters that we had some gains in Europe on the process transaction side. But overall as Al said, I mean, we\u2019re very pleased with the way the \u2013 the vast majority of our business in Europe is under contract, and we have been for a certain portion of that working with clients to reset commercial terms once rebates went away and that's gone well longer than we would have liked, but it's going well.", "So, on all fronts Europe has done, as we\u2019ve said before equal to or better than we expected. And from an accretion standpoint certainly has been performing better than we expected and we\u2019ll give you a little more about that once we are through with the year and can give you a full sense of the year.", "Moshe Katri", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Jim Schneider", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and good luck to you Jack in your future endeavors. I guess, my question really comes down to the cross-border, obviously the volume is holding in there, but at least by our calculations it looks like the cross-border yield improved somewhat. So, can you maybe give us a sense of whether that's correct and if so what drove it? Was it regional mix? Was there some pricing impact or was it one of wins you just referred to?", "Al Kelly", "No. I don't think you should conclude that there was an improvement in yield necessarily. I mean, clearly from quarter to quarter there are some changes in mix and so on. Some of it could be as you see the exchange rate had been moderating a bit certainly that helps our reported cross-border dollar numbers. But there was nothing -- there was no real change that would drive a big change in yields in the cross-border business.", "Jim Schneider", "And maybe you could also just kind of address the incentive levels and you talked about being almost 80% of the way there by the time you finish this fiscal year. Can you maybe just address directionally where those incentive levels would go in terms of normalizing as we headed into 2018?", "Al Kelly", "Yes. We\u2019ll talk about that when we talk about 2018. We\u2019re not \u2013 I mean, if your question was what\u2019s the likely range of incentives or the percent of gross revenues and all that next year. I think we can get into all that when we talk about 2018, so its little too early to talk about all that right now.", "I think all we were signaling was that there is going to be some shift in Europe of incentives from what we thought we would get done this year into next year. And I want to emphasize that is driven more by client preferences and timetables and their desire to do things on a certain timetable than ours, and we\u2019re adapting to their requirements.", "Jim Schneider", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Thank you, Jack. Congrats my friend. It\u2019s been fun. I guess a question I don\u2019t want to ask \u2013 should I think which one to ask. Okay. So, the -- maybe just the change in guidance. Can you just walk us through the change in guidance? How much of it is incentives versus some other factors. And the change to the incentive outlook, is at all timing or do you anticipate paying little bit less than what you previously forecast?", "Al Kelly", "Well, there\u2019s a little bit of let's call it better than expected execution, a little bit of it in Europe, but you should think of it as almost all timing and almost all Europe. So that's one contributor. The three factors that went into sort of the change in the outlook is the performance we\u2019ve had to-date, some moderation in the exchange rate headwind, some reduction in the original expectation on incentive. And on the EPS side it reflects the benefits we\u2019re getting from the tax rate we now have which we talked about last quarter, as well as the revenue being stronger than we had thought at the beginning of the year. So, there's no \u2013 there\u2019s nothing unusual other than the actual results and the trends we\u2019re seeing.", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Got it. Thank you.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Tien-Tsin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ramsey El-Assal", "Hi, guys and congratulations Jack, we\u2019re going to miss your special sense of humor. I was -- I had a follow-up question also on incentives kind going on Tien-Tsin question which is simply that as we sort of \u2013 as incentives -- the expected level kind of get pushed out, does it increase the chances of sort of incremental volatility and outline? Will there be a quarter coming up where we get a sort of a snapback there and it catches folks by surprise or should you do just they sort of push out and imply kind of a gradual slope?", "Jack Carsky", "Again, I\u2019d just remind everybody that this -- there are at least three factors that go into this that make this somewhat difficult to predict. And I think we\u2019ve shown how difficult it is to predict, because we haven\u2019t hit the number in the last couple quarters, but it\u2019s the -- when is the deal going to actually come to pass? What are going to be the terms of the deal as you actually get in to the last bits of negotiation?", "And then, what actually volumes are you going to get against those negotiated terms. So, the reality is, in this particular case it just that the period of time to get through over a 100 client contract is just taking longer than we thought. I don't think we want to get into predicting business or forecasting business or what it would look like quarter by quarter, but I think this is just simply a matter of a process that we have to get through and as Vasant said we\u2019re hoping to get through at about 80% of it by the end of the fiscal year.", "Vasant Prabhu", "And as we\u2019ve told you before, I mean, its not something we think should be focused on to the extent it is on a quarter by quarter basis. And as you know we explicitly don't try to get deals done based on quarterly timetables and so on. So the short answer to your question is that a snapback kind of thing? No. But is there likely to be a quarter where incentives run higher than we might have expected. Of course, I means just as they\u2019ve run lower than we expected in some quarters and some quarters they could run higher than we expected. But that isn\u2019t any snapback kind of reasons that you should expect. We typically look ahead and give you our better sense of what might get done in the quarter coming up.", "Jack Carsky", "Next question please.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Thanks, Ramsey.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Darrin Peller", "Nice guys. Just first of all, Jack, congrats again. We\u2019ll catch up soon, but we\u2019re going to miss obviously. Just on the higher level now, if you can just touch again, I mean on the pricing environment a bit more you know again you commented on yields coming in better in Europe since the deal, and we've seen a number of years were obviously incentives and rebates have been higher both as a percentage of gross revenues on a year-to-year basis.", "It feels like at some point on the gross yield side it's going higher, but the rebate side is keeping up pace to some extent that you would see a bit of a divergence between the two. I mean, is there anything you can comment on conceptually and what you're seeing in your conversations with clients? Has there been more of a realization that the value add you guys provide has reached the level where pricing is at a point where we don't need to keep providing higher and higher incentives and rebates. This is about the right points. Just a little more color on that would be great?", "And then just a quick comment on Q4, I know you're saying some of the Europeans stuff is pushed and there\u2019s been a lot of questions on incentives, but it looks like calculating what you're guiding would be about $200 million sequential increasing in your incentive and rebate line, which is kind of lot. I mean it just hard to envision why that would all be in one quarter unless there\u2019s I think someone else has other things going on. So that\u2019s really just the thought of the question. Thanks guys.", "Al Kelly", "One the first question Darrin, when you look at the overall numbers, it's a result of hundreds of deals around the world, and they all take on different flavors. I think in general people bet many of our clients and a testament to that is the longevity of many of our relationships that are very deep and have lasted decades that people value plenty of aspects what Visa brings to the table from our global scale to our risk and fraud prevention tools to our brand et cetera.", "That said, all of that stuff is valued when it comes to negotiation people negotiate a card as do we and you end up, everybody ends up, compromising and end up in a certain place. But I think I haven't seen nor as I\u2019ve talked to our clients around the world, any view that the value that we\u2019re bringing into the table is any less than it's been in fact. I think as we move into a digital world and we continue to try to be a leader in terms of thinking about digital tools and solutions that I think that many issuers particularly when you get beyond the very top issuers who also had the funds and wherewithal to be investing in some of these kinds of capabilities that are -- what we bring to the table is very valued. Vasant, you want to add to that.", "Vasant Prabhu", "The only thing was that there was a specific question on why client incentive if you derived the fourth quarter might look the way they do. I would say a couple of things. There is the fiscal fourth quarter effect to some degree in that. We have been talking to people especially in Europe for several months now in and it back and forth on finalizing agreements and the documentation and so on and there\u2019s a fair amount of that is happening in the fourth quarter and as we get it done in the fourth quarter since these discussions have been underway for a few months.", "As happens in many cases the incentives you pay reflect when the deal was either agreed to or initially discuss. So there\u2019s an element of retro-attractiveness to it all of which is captured in the incentives you would probably recognize in the fourth quarter. So some elements of all that that flow into it, and then as Al said, I mean, we have fairly rigorous process and we do the best we can to give you the best sense, but in the end we won't sign a deal because quarterly deadline is approaching, but we\u2019ll do our very best to get done everything we are setting out to do right now.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Darrin. Next question.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is open.", "Craig Maurer", "Hi. Jack, it\u2019s been pleasure over the better part of 15 years, hopefully we can meet up in Tahoe one day. Regarding the business can you first comment on what your success rate has been in Asia and China specifically in converting dual brand cards into a single brand companion card for cross-border? And secondly, was there any benefit in service fees from the restructuring of contracts around the breakup of scheme and processing in Europe? Thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "On service fees in Europe really sort of it\u2019s \u2013 the breakup of scheme and processing. We\u2019ll se over time what the impact is. But in the short run it really has no impact on the fee structure that was in place. But it will evolve over time, I\u2019m sure. In China you know\u2026", "Al Kelly", "I think in China we have I think we have 55 banks and 42 of them only issue the single branded card. The remaining 14, 13 do the dual branded. We\u2019ve had some success, frankly not as good as we would like it be and its going to continue to be a real focus of ours and something that given the importance of the cross-border volume from China something that we\u2019re working closely with the banks on. I\u2019m going be in India and China in three weeks and that is something that I will be talking to both our team there as well as our Chinese client.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yes. Just in terms of the trend in that business over the last couple of quarters we highlighted issue last quarter. I want you to know as we said earlier that if you adjust for China, Asia was growing double-digit. The domestic dual branded card volumes in China were relatively stable quarter to quarter, so we didn\u2019t see a sequential decline. And the cross-border business coming out of China as Al said in his comments has been strong and stable. How it all plays out in the next few months, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.", "Craig Maurer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you and congratulation Jack, it\u2019s bittersweet. I guess I have another question on incentives and specific to Europe through the commercialization of the contract there, understanding there some -- the timing-related impacts that are causing lower incentives this year. Are there any specific pricing impact as well that happen in conjunction with the commercialization of those contracts? Or should we expect those to sort of happen at the same time? Thanks.", "Al Kelly", "We made -- in the year that we've owned Visa Europe. We have made a few pricing changes and there are number pricing changes that we\u2019re continuing to look at it in addition to obviously the commercialization of as you said of the contracts to do away with rebates and put incentives in place.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "But do those happen at the same time at points like when you renew them and put in new incentive agreements. Does that come with the revised price schedule?", "Al Kelly", "So the price schedule as you know we have our price schedule and then the incentives then are tailored by client. So when we make price adjustments we make them for the system as a whole typically and then the commercial \u2013 the commercialization of some of these contracts is something we do client by client. And just to emphasize, I mean the vast majority of our business in Europe has been and remains under contract. This is something we\u2019re doing ourselves proactively to adjust some of the terms in the contracts to make them more commercial in a world where rebates no longer existed. But the pricing itself is that's related to our normal course what we call rack rates or list prices or whatever you want to call it.", "Jack Carsky", "Okay. Thanks Sanjay. Next question.", "Operator", "Yes. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Dan Perlin", "Thanks. And Jack, I can only say one thing, jealous but congratulations. Well deserved, I'm sure. A lot was said at the Analyst Day around Visa Direct, and I wanted to just kind of hone in on the partnership you have now with PayPal, this collaboration you guys are doing. I guess one is are those cards -- the debit cards that are going to be issued, are you going to actually route those through Visa Direct? And then secondly, do you think that, that partnership will help insulate you guys from some of the risks associated with PSD2? Thanks.", "Jack Carsky", "Well, first of all we\u2019re very pleased to extent our deals that we have with PayPal in North America and Asia into Europe. And particularly the fact that we\u2019re operating full consumer choice, and obviously part of the deal is the ability to use Visa Direct to push PayPal account balance to bank accounts. And it's a fairly extensive deal because there\u2019s also an enablement of Visa Checkout relative to the Braintree Gateway.", "And in Europe in particular given the fact that PayPal has a banking license we\u2019re obviously licensing them as a full-fledged issuer where they'll issue PayPal\u2019s debit cards in Europe. So it's an extensive agreement that absolutely covers Visa Direct, but it also covers the very important aspect of the prior deals centered around full consumer choice as well as then working closely with us in enabling Visa Checkout as well.", "Dan Perlin", "And do you think that helps in that partnership to protect you guys from PSD2 as that regulation rolls within 2018?", "Al Kelly", "I think that everywhere that we can further embed a Visa card into the payment stream and build the loyalty of the consumer certainly helps us. I mean, I think that at the end of the day PSD2 is going to generate a requirement that everybody focuses really hard on consumers and trying to make sure that they're providing the best possible consumer value propositions and the best possible consumer experiences. So to the degree that we could help further solidify the relationship that our issuers have with their customers, all that can only go to help fortify the issuers against the against PSD2 and the competition that can come from their accounts happening to be opened.", "Dan Perlin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche. Your line is open.", "Bryan Keane", "Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask what percentage of the European contracts are done today? I know you said 75% to 80% is the goal for the end of the year, but just looking for a mark for today. And then secondly at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition I think the deal was to be EPS accretive in low single digits for fiscal year 2017 and then high single-digit percentage points range by fiscal year 2020. There\u2019s been a lot of moving pieces here. I'm just looking for an update now on if those goals will stand?", "Al Kelly", "Well, the question number one, Bryan, and I\u2019ll let Vasant answer question number two. We don\u2019t want to get into a daily tally sheet on this, but again we\u2019re not probably going to disappoint by not quantifying exactly where we are, but I think you can assume that we\u2019re somewhere below 80, but above a fairly decent number since that we are confident in being able to say we think we can get to 80% by the end of the fourth quarter, but we don't really want to get into setting a precedent of providing that kind of update. Vasant, in term of accretion.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yes. In terms of accretion as you all know, volumes, European economies have been stronger than we expected, so our volumes as you\u2019ve seen have been running better than we might have expected at the beginning of the year. All when we did the acquisition model that valued Visa Europe. Certainly the weak pound and the euro have helped the cross-border business, frankly the weak pound has caused a massive amount of cross-border into the UK.", "In addition to that you know that we have taken some pricing and our yields have run a little better than we expected. And so far things are well in terms of renewals and retaining contracts and business and so on. So when you put it all together clearly Visa Europe is doing better than we expected this year and accretion is running ahead of the low single-digits we have told you. But the year isn't over yet, so we\u2019ll till the end of the year and give you an update in October as to whether accretion was in the first year and whether we have a different perspective on the longer term outlook on accretion. But its early days and things are going well.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane", "Right. Thanks. Congrats Jack as well.", "Jack Carsky", "Thanks, Bryan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vasu Govil", "Hi. This is Vasu Govil for James. Thanks for taking my question and Jack, congratulations.", "Jack Carsky", "Thank you.", "Vasu Govil", "Just quick question, first one to Vasant, you talked about \u2013 you sort of mentioned that cross-border volumes would kind of lap the double-digit growth rate next quarter. So just want to get a sense for what\u2019s baked into guidance? Are we assuming that this double-digit growth rate is sustainable or do you think that it could decelerate back into the sort of high single-digit range?", "And then a question for Al on India, Visa is clearly benefiting from the government push towards non-cash form of payment there, but there are local mobile wallet players that seem to be making a big portion there fast getting traction. So can you talk about the competitive dynamic and potential for India -- the Indian market to kind of leapfrog card payments and go straight to mobile? And how is Visa position on the ground do sort of preserve and grew their within electronic payments in India?", "Vasant Prabhu", "So, on the cross-border growth rate, real quick, we like what we see on the cross-border trend. We\u2019ve seen the pound strengthen a bit, but that didn\u2019t change the strength of the cross-border business into the UK. We saw the dollar weaken a bit, but that didn\u2019t seem to change the trend so far of cross-border business outside going, leaving the U.S. So overall the cross-border business seems to have pretty good momentum. And yes, the comparison get tougher, but we feel pretty optimistic about it. So we\u2019ll wait and see how it goes. When you lap big increases of course you have to \u2013 it\u2019s a little harder to forecast, but we like what we see a lot.", "Al Kelly", "In terms of India, its such an exciting market and there's a lot going on obviously because it's an exciting market and a lot going on, there\u2019s a number of players trying to get into the market. We\u2019ve been there for a long time. We believe that as we think about growing our network and in particular merchant acceptance that we have to have different plans in emerging market versus a developed market and in the case of India we clearly have to have a way that's low cost, low hassle, low friction to enable merchants to sign up and that is why we initially went with a QR code and now we have worked closely with some of our network colleagues on an interoperable QR code that works with our mVisa application and allows a quick and easy and will have to setup for merchants and a relatively easy experience for the India consumer.", "It is very very early in the payments maturation curve for India. There is years of to still play out here and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to take advantage of our heritage and tradition, our brand, our different products that are our security, the globality of our network as well as our digital tools to make sure that we\u2019re winning at least our fair share if not more of the business in India as it grows recognizing clearly that we've got competitors that go beyond the -- just the traditional players that we competed with over the last number of decades.", "Vasu Govil", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Al Kelly", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paulo Ribeiro from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Thank you. Good evening. When you talk about the impact on expenses from tech investing, could you give us some color on where you\u2019re investing? I assume part of it is China and where else in terms of either geography or products have you guys focused your dollars on?", "Al Kelly", "I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re talking about technology?", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Yes. Your technology, because you guys mentioned that what's driving expense is technology and Visa Europe integration? What is in technology? Where are you spending the money in terms of....", "Al Kelly", "Well I\u2019ll start and Vasant can add to what I have to say. Clearly China is one where we\u2019ve stated a number of times that we are investing ahead of the process of you\u2019ve been able to actually operate there not knowing exactly when that will be. I would say the other categories that come immediately to mind are open VisaNet.", "We talked a bit about that at Investor Day that we are looking as we have begun the process of building a more open architecture world and a more modularized version of VisaNet to meet the needs that we have going forward and allow us the flexibility to actually we have necessary put processing right in a country without it being a big deal where a data center could be in a small closet as opposed to a large facility that has to have all of the accompanying electronics and cooling and etcetera fairly digital.", "And all of the digital tools that we are building is an area that we are spending a lot of time and effort on research. We opened up a -- I think we talked about this at some point in the past that in February we opened up a new facility in [Indiscernible] focussed on research and we are doing a whole number of things around looking at applications of block chain and all official intelligence and different other ways to build a data and our analytics capabilities.", "And I guess the fifth category I would say would be security and cyber security given how important security and trust in the payments ecosystem is we continue to look at every possible offering that\u2019s out there related to physical and cyber security and make sure that we are being leading edge and investing appropriately to make sure that given the role that we play in the ecosystem that we are doing everything we possibly can help make sure that transactions as they are flowing through the system and transactions as when they are at rest are all protected to the maximum degree possible. So those will be the things I would say. Would you add anything Vasant?", "Vasant Prabhu", "Yes, I think the other things Al went through I think a very comprehensive list. I mean a few other things just to highlight would be continued investment in the Visa developer platform. Investments and now rolling our Visa checkout and Visa Token Service and mVisa around the world. Big push on mVisa in places like India and parts of Africa. Investments in our innovation centers, you heard about the London Innovation center and how significant it has become. Investments in co-development around our innovation centers with our clients. So that\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of areas where the things we have developed are now in the process of being deployed.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Great. Just a quick clarification. PayPal, the roll out of the PayPal partnerships around the world they are not a big investment, they are not in that number then that we are spending.", "Al Kelly", "There is a little bit of work there, but the essences of those agreements are not a major workload for us, it\u2019s more a matter of, actually more change actually on the part of PayPal and it is on part of us. And I\u2019d say \u2013 I\u2019d add that they have been a really terrific partner.", "Paulo Ribeiro", "Thanks.", "Al Kelly", "Jenny, at this point we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Lisa Ellis", "Hey guys and Jack you will be next one final congrats from me. Visa Checkout related question from me, one, do you have any updated stats to give us on Visa checkout and then little bit of a more strategic question, you know you continue to kind of fight head to head with Visa Checkout with these more staged wallets around the world whether that\u2019s with PayPal or with [Indiscernible] payor now some of the models inside of Amazon, would you contemplate adding more of that capability within Visa Checkout meaning via prepaid vehicle the ability to keep a store balance Visa Direct, using Visa Direct to be able to enable P2P and why enrol or why not?", "Al Kelly", "Hi Lisa. And answer to your first question, we are nearing 23 million users who have signed, you know actually signed up for Visa Checkout. I think we talked a little bit about this. The whole wallet [ph] thing is a bit of a mixed bag of activity around the industry and I think not necessarily the most user friendly thing for consumers because there are so many options. We think of these Checkout more as a platform that we necessarily think about it as wallet and but that said strategically I think anything that supports the four party model that makes sense in terms of integration or capability we\u2019re going to be open to look at as we go forward, because ultimately we want to be part of a solution of coming up with a smaller number of easy, convenient and wallet that have the type of functionality that consumers would want and expect and hope that help brings some of what I think is a bit of confusion around wallets and Checkout in the e-commerce world, bring a bit more order to it overtime.", "Lisa Ellis", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Al Kelly", "Thanks, Lisa.", "Jack Carsky", "And thank you all for joining us today.

Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "May I now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Investor Relations? Mr. Carsky, you may now begin.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal fourth quarter 2017 and full-year earnings conference call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer, and Joon Huh of our IR team.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements.

Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "Jack, thank you very much, and good morning to everybody. We're actually conducting this call from our New York City office, which gives us an opportunity to do a morning call, but I do appreciate everybody joining us early in the day and obviously very early in the day if you're on the West Coast.", "I'm pleased to say that we had another very solid quarter of business performance, resulting in a strong finish to our fiscal 2017. We saw our broad-based business momentum carry into the fourth quarter as we'd outperformed our expectations.", "Similar to prior quarters, we saw a healthy cross-border growth globally despite lapping what was a strong double-digit quarter last year. We saw a good domestic growth in multiple countries, including India, Russia and Australia. In the United States, our domestic business proved to be resilient despite concerns about slowing retail sales data over the past quarter. And although payments volume slowed in the U.S. due to expected lapping of notable partnerships, we did see healthy payments volume growth across all the regions with total growth in constant dollars of 10%.", "Processed transactions sustained a solid growth rate of 13% globally. And we had a high level of contract and renewal activity in the quarter, driving client incentives to 21.7% of gross revenue, the highest percentage for the year.", "All of this led to a strong fourth quarter financial results as we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and adjusted EPS growth of 15%. After I'm finished with my remarks, Vasant will go into greater financial detail on some of the comparisons and provide more background on the numbers.", "Now let me take a few minutes to cover business highlights as we had a particularly active quarter in terms of partnerships and announcements. We completed two significant partnerships in Russia and our CEMEA region. We signed a multi-year partnership renewal covering a full portfolio with Sberbank, the largest bank in the region. And we renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership agreement with Alpha Bank.", "In Asia, we executed a multi-year credit deal with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. In Europe, we continue to make good progress with our clients. This quarter, we reached our goal and resolved approximately 75% of contracts moving from rebates to commercial incentives. We expect the remaining 25% of contract to shift into the first half of FY 2018.", "On the digital product side, we launched our new mobile solution mVisa in Kenya and Nigeria, and we've been working hard to bring merchants and consumers onto that platform. We announced a global partnership with Marqeta, an innovative card-issuing platform designed to drive new commercial and consumer payments experiences.", "In July, we extended our strategic partnership with PayPal to Europe to accelerate the adoption of secure and convenient online, in-app and in-store payments across Europe. In August, we launched a national rollout of Visa local offers with Uber. This allows riders to earn Uber credit for making purchases using their Visa credit card at a number of local participating merchants.", "We also announced partnerships with Fitbit and Garmin to enable digital payments through their wearable devices as mobile connectivity increases. And our push payments product, Visa Direct, continue to perform very well as we saw accelerating volumes with over 75% year-over-year growth driven by North America and the CEMEA Regions.", "This month, we announced our partnership with Billtrust to help streamline the reconciliation of B2B payments. We also made a strategic investment in Billtrust to help support its efforts to grow the important B2B segment. And most recently, we announced Visa ID Intelligence, which is a platform that allows issuers, acquirers and merchants to quickly adopt emergent authentication technologies and to create more and convenient ways, which are secure for consumers to shop, pay and bank on their devices. So as you can see, we had a lot of exciting activity this past quarter.", "Now, I'd like to look back over the last year, which was my first year at Visa, and I'm gratified with our ability to execute our operating plan guided by our strategic pillars. As a result, we have delivered excellent financial results every quarter this year. In terms of the drivers of growth, I'd highlight the following.", "First, Visa has a strong and experienced set of issuer clients who have worked hard internally and with us to drive payment volume growth. We have a real and committed focus on client engagement around the world. New partnerships like USAA and Costco were obviously big contributors in the first three quarters of the year. Economic growth around the world has been strong, which has driven increased e-commerce in more developed countries and a combination of new solutions and positively activist governments has helped drive growth in less developed countries.", "The good economies around the world also spurred healthy levels of travel, which helped grow our important cross-border business, where we saw healthy results in each of our five Regions. New solutions like mVisa, which I mentioned, for less developed markets and digital solutions like Visa Checkout, Visa Direct and Visa Token Services in developed countries are starting to take hold, although I would say it is still early innings.", "Our growth has been robust despite exchange rate headwinds for most of the year, and these headwinds appear to be abating as we go into next year. And then the addition of Europe to the Visa lineup has been a real catalyst for growth in 2017.", "And speaking of Europe, over the past year, I've been asked repeatedly how the Europe integration is going. So let me take a few minutes to give you some thoughts on this question, and I'll do so by briefly addressing Europe in terms of partnerships, revenue, expenses, people, regulation and technology. The overall headline is that we are pleased with the progress and running well ahead of where we thought we would be. We worked hard to bring the best of Visa Inc. from around the world to Visa Europe. At a recent client event, I said that the acquisition brought Europe to Visa and the world to Europe.", "In terms of partnerships, our clients in Europe are eager to bring our global innovations to Europe as fast as possible. We have more to do for sure, but we've had many senior leadership reach out to our key clients and established an innovation center in London over the past six to nine months. We have already brought a number of our digital solutions to Europe as well as some of our strategic partnerships. We held a large European client event in Barcelona about a month ago, and the feedback from clients relative to the integration and Visa in general was very good.", "In terms of revenue, we have worked hard to commercialize the business by selectively introducing new pricing and moving from rebates to incentives. And again, more to do, but we are off to an excellent start.", "In terms of expenses, we moved faster than anticipated rationalizing our expense base to take out redundancies. In terms of people, we've reshaped much of the Europe leadership team. The CEO who steered the acquisition left in early 2017. And I asked a Visa veteran, Bill Sheedy, to take a multi-month temporary assignment as the head of Europe, and Bill did a simply wonderful job driving the organization through the integration and all the associated changes. Bill created a team that looks more like our other regional teams around the world by elevating some Europe talent, importing Visa people from other geographies into Europe, and hiring some terrific new people from the outside.", "And speaking of new people from the outside, about four weeks ago Charlotte Hogg took over as our regional leader for Europe. Charlotte comes with experience at the Bank of England, where she was the COO, Santander UK, Experian, Discover, Morgan Stanley, and McKinsey. Charlotte has hit the ground running, and I'm confident that she'll be an outstanding leader of Europe. And Charlotte will be able to continue to lean on Bill, who will remain in Europe for the next month or so.", "In terms of regulation, we certainly recognize that there is more regulatory activity in Europe than the other regions. Our strategy has been to engage actively with regulators, with whom we desire to build high-quality relationships, and with our clients to make sure we shape win-win outcomes wherever possible.", "Finally, relative to technology, we are on or slightly ahead of schedule. The migration of the technology platform is a key priority for us, and we have focused much time and attention on it. Our objective is a smooth transition for our European clients to a global technology platform that will open up a wider set of solutions and products.", "So five quarters in, revenues are tracking above projections, expenses are below, with a lower effective tax rate. EPS accretion in FY 2017 was in the mid-single digits, and the momentum is good as we enter 2018. So as we begin fiscal 2018, I'm excited about the many opportunities in front of us. 2018 will mark the end of the first decade of Visa as a public company and the commencement of the second decade.", "Relative to 2018, let me offer a few thoughts. The fundamentals will continue to matter a lot, so we will be focused on lifting our game, our client engagement across the world. We will also continue on a journey that I began on the day I joined Visa, which is to build a world-class organization in terms of talent and leadership. We have put a number of building blocks in place in the last 12 months to drive improvements in all areas of the talent continuum, and we have significantly dialed up the emphasis on leadership and the expectations that I have of the leaders at Visa.", "When we talk about fundamentals, cyber security is critical, and we will continue to invest to make our technology environment and the payments ecosystem as safe as possible.", "We are mid-process toward a goal of empowering our regional and country management teams in a greater way. We want to push more decision-making closer to the markets and our clients. We do so because while we are a global company, we know that the consumer businesses around the world are indeed local in nature and therefore different. In doing so, we will ensure that there is appropriate level of staging, oversight, and accountability. We will invest against initiatives that are consistent with the seven pillars of our strategy. We outlined many of our growth strategies at our Investor Day in June.", "In FY 2018, we will continue to invest aggressively in a set of focus priorities. Our areas of focus include driving greater and faster adoption of our digital solutions, expanding Visa Direct, extending acceptance around the world, driving cross-border growth, and advancing Open VisaNet.", "Relative to Europe, we have developed a strategy that is consistent with our global direction but customized to the specifics of Europe. We are bullish on Europe and think there's a good deal of upside. We see tremendous diversity across the markets with countries that have large cash-based economies, balanced by others that have moved to near-cashless economies. In fact, immediately following this call, I'm headed to London for two days of strategy and action planning meetings with the Europe leadership team.", "As we look ahead to the next decade, disciplined capital allocation remains critical, with the following prioritization. First, our top priority is to invest at healthy levels to drive robust organic growth in our core businesses. Second, we will explore selective acquisitions that bolster our capabilities and enhance the value we can offer to our partner banks, acquirers, and merchants. Third, we will return excess cash to you, our shareholders, through dividends and buybacks.", "In FY 2017, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In FY 2018, with a higher dividend payout recently authorized by the Visa Board of Directors and stock buybacks in excess of $7 billion, we expect to return over $9 billion to shareholders, even as we invest at healthy levels in our business.", "In closing, our expectation is that 2018 is only the first year of a multiyear plan that ensures our second decade continues to deliver superior shareholder value through long-term sustainable growth, much as we did through the first decade.", "With that, let me turn it over to my partner, Vasant Prabhu.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Thank you, Al, and good morning to all.", "We had a strong finish to fiscal year 2017. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter net revenues and EPS were both up 14%. As a reminder, this is the first quarter where we have Visa Europe included in our reported numbers in the prior year.", "We closed fiscal 2017 with full-year net revenues of $18.4 billion, up 22%. Net income on a GAAP basis was $6.7 billion, and EPS was $2.80. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year was $8.3 billion, up 21%. And EPS was $3.48, up 22%. All in all, a strong growth year, which exceeded our expectations, especially in Europe, which contributed with mid-single-digit EPS accretion.", "Europe net revenues were ahead of our acquisition model projection, and operating expenses were below projection, with a lower effective tax rate post the legal entity reorganization we completed earlier this year. A few other points to note. Payment volumes on a constant-dollar basis, excluding Europe co-badge volume, continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. In the U.S., the step-down in growth rate reflects the lapping of Costco and USAA conversions in 2016. As a reminder, Costco started accepting Visa credit card in-store on June 20, 2016, and the first co-brand cards were issued.", "USAA credit conversion was completed in September 2016, USAA debit conversion completed by October 2016. Strong cross-border constant dollar growth was sustained in the double digits. However, the weakening of the dollar, particularly relative to the euro and the pound, is starting to have an impact on the mix of cross-border business. Most notably, outbound commerce from the U.S. is slowing down as is inbound commerce into Europe, especially to the U.K. There is some improvement in outbound commerce from Europe, but no meaningful pickup yet in inbound commerce into the U.S.", "These shifts will need to be monitored. Natural disasters have impacted our business. In Houston and Florida, it appears that business has largely returned to normal after some significant dislocations around the hurricane. However, the effects of the hurricanes on the Caribbean and the Mexico City earthquake are ongoing. Travel into and out of these locations continues to be below trend. As expected, we had a very active quarter on the contract renewal front. In Europe, we were able to achieve our goal of getting approximately 75% of the contract conversions from rebates to commercial incentives that we had set out to do resolved in fiscal year 2017.", "Approximately 25% are shifting into the first half of fiscal 2018, largely driven by client timetable. We also had several significant renewals in China and Russia. As a result, client incentives as a percent of gross revenues were 21.7% in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the full year run rate of 19.9%. The approximately 25% of contract conversion that are shifting to fiscal 2018 in Europe reduced our incentives as a percent of gross revenues by 15 basis points in fiscal year 2017 and will add almost 50 basis points in fiscal year 2018. This shift, which amounts to around $0.03 of EPS, added 1 percentage point to our EPS growth in fiscal year 2017 and will reduce fiscal year 2018 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point.", "We repurchased 16.9 million shares of Visa stock in the fourth quarter or $1.7 billion at an average price of $102.54. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased a total of 76.1 million shares for $6.9 billion at an average price of $90.31. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends, and our board has authorized an increase of 18% in our quarterly dividend to $0.195 per share. Finally, on September 11, we issued $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes with maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years with a weighted average interest rate of 2.78% and weighted average maturity of 14 years. On October 11, we redeemed $1.75 billion of our December 27 notes.", "A quick review of the quarter's business drivers and our financial results. U.S. payments volumes grew 9% as credit grew 10% and debit grew 8%. As I mentioned earlier, the step-down in these growth rates was driven by the lapping of Costco and USAA conversions last year. Adjusted for the impact of conversion, underlying credit growth rates have been stable in the high single digits for the past four quarters.", "Adjusted for Interlink, the U.S. debit growth trend was also stable. Reported debit growth ticked up from the prior quarter due to Interlink, where we are now lapping a routing loss last year. International payments volumes in constant dollars grew 10%, excluding Europe co-badge volumes in all periods. Growth trends remain stable and robust around the globe.", "Global cross-border volumes grew 10%. It's important to note that cross-border growth hit double digits, normalized for Europe in Q4 2016 for the first time after several weak quarters. The cross-border growth rates held up in the fourth quarter despite tougher comparisons.", "U.S. cross-border growth is slowing as the dollar weakens as well as some impact from lapping the Costco and USAA conversions. Cross-border growth in Mexico and the Caribbean was impacted by the earthquake and hurricanes. On the other hand, outbound commerce picked up a bit from Europe as the euro and the pound have strengthened.", "Other currency shifts of the Russian ruble, Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, Aussie and Canadian dollars are also changing the mix of our cross-border business, which will need to be closely monitored. Transactions processed over VisaNet grew 13%, in line with the prior quarter when normalized for Europe. Through October 21, U.S. payments volumes growth was 8.7%, with U.S. credit growing 9.9% and debit, 7.4%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis was up 7.4%. Processed transactions grew 12.6%.", "Net revenues in Q4 grew 14%. While we have Europe in our prior reported numbers, it is important to note that rebates in Europe continued to be paid through the end of fiscal 2016. Exchange rate shifts helped reported Q4 net revenue growth by less than 50 basis points.", "Operating expenses were flat to last year, which included severance cost related to the acquisition of Visa Europe and our global restructuring. Adjusted to exclude these special items, operating expenses in Q4 grew 8%, largely driven by personnel costs and expenses related to projects that were delayed into the fourth quarter, particularly in Europe.", "Personnel costs were higher as hiring picked up post our restructuring in Europe and globally at the end of fiscal year 2016. We also incurred higher incentive accruals as performance exceeded our expectations. Professional fees ramped up in the second half around Europe technology integration as well as other key technology development programs.", "Our Q4 tax rate was 31%. EPS was $0.90, up 14%. Exchange rate shifts helped reported Q4 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point. For the full year of fiscal 2017, net revenues were $18.4 billion, up 22% with an approximately 1.5 percentage points negative currency impact. Full year adjusted EPS was $3.48, also up 22% with a currency headwind of over 2 percentage points.", "With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2018. The many significant events of fiscal 2017 will have a meaningful impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in fiscal 2018. A few points to highlight before I get into the details.", "First, unlike fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2018 will lap a full year of Europe in our reported numbers. While the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included Europe in both years, the ending of rebates to Visa Europe members did not go into effect until the first quarter of fiscal 2017. So the first quarter of apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe is Q1 FY 2018. Second, in Q1 FY 2018, we get close to an apples-to-apples growth comparison for Costco and in Q2 FY 2018 for USAA.", "Third, the India demonetization impact started in November 2016. As you know, this led to a more than doubling of our India payment volume and processed transaction. We begin to lap this in the latter part of Q1 2018. Fourth, as we indicated, through the first half of fiscal 2017, there were delays in Europe converting contracts to replace rebates with appropriate commercial incentive terms. As such, our client incentives were significantly lower than we had anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017. As I mentioned earlier, approximately 75% of these contract conversions were resolved by the end of fiscal 2017, and the remainder will be done primarily in the first half of fiscal 2018.", "As a result, client incentives in the first half of 2018 will be significantly higher than fiscal year 2017, with incentive growth moderating in Q4 2018. Finally, our U.S. price increases went into effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and our international price increases went into effect mostly in the second quarter of 2017. We will lap these price increases in the first half of 2018. Fiscal 2018 price increases are smaller in scope and will go into effect in the second half of the year. All these factors have been incorporated into our outlook for fiscal 2018. They will also impact the quarterly cadence of net revenue and EPS growth.", "Let me now get into some of the details starting with payment volumes. Payment volumes globally have grown around 10% in constant dollars for the past two years normalized for Europe. Thanks to Costco and USAA, U.S. payment volume growth stepped up to the double-digit range in fiscal 2017 and will tick down to the high single digits in fiscal 2018 as we lap both conversions. International payment volume growth as reported will now reflect Europe in both years. We have been providing payment volume growth rates normalized for Europe in our data pack each quarter.", "Excluding Europe co-badge volume, normalized constant-dollar international payment volume growth rates were almost 10% in fiscal 2017. We anticipate some moderation in these growth rates in 2018 due to the dual brand run-off in China and the demonetization impact in India. Global second half growth rates are expected to be better than the first half, helped by some smaller conversions in the U.S., the ramping of Visa Direct volume, and lapping the declines in China dual-brand volumes in fiscal 2017. Overall, for fiscal year 2018, our outlook anticipates high single-digit constant-dollar payment volume growth rates globally.", "Moving on to the cross-border business, cross-border volumes, as you all know, are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the pound. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, the strong dollar, weak euro and pound dynamic led to very strong outbound commerce from the U.S. and high inbound commerce into Europe, especially the UK.", "In the fourth quarter, these trends started to change as the dollar weakened, especially versus the euro and the pound. Assuming these trends continue, we anticipate a slowdown in U.S. outbound commerce, with a step up in growth of commerce coming into the U.S. and vice-versa in Europe and the UK. We're assuming this trend is accentuated through the year if dollar weakness continues.", "Overall, our outlook anticipates high cross-border growth is sustained in fiscal year 2018, with a change in mix as described. International revenue growth rates are expected to be higher in the second half, when some pricing actions go into effect.", "The other variable that impacts our international revenues is currency volatility. After high volatility in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 post the Brexit surprise, currency volatility has been subdued through most of 2017. Currency volatility has been running below the long-term mean. For purposes of our outlook, we are assuming that volatility stay at these levels through fiscal year 2018.", "Normalized to include Europe for the full year, we had healthy double-digit processed transaction growth in fiscal year 2017, helped by the Costco/USAA conversions in the U.S., the impact of India demonetization, and the processing win in Europe in the year. We expect a small step-down in growth rates in fiscal 2018 as we lap these items. We anticipate, however, that transaction growth will remain in the double digits, with generally steady growth through the year. Data processing revenue growth rates are also expected to be higher in the second half, helped by some pricing actions that go into effect.", "On the client incentive front, we ended the year with incentives in the fourth quarter as a percent of gross revenues at 21.7%. Our outlook for fiscal 2018 is a range of 21.5% to 22.5%. Client incentives in the first half of 2017 averaged 18.8%, well below our expectations going into the year, primarily due to the delays in Europe. In the third quarter, this climbed to 20% as Europe contract activity picked up steam, finishing at 21.7% in Q4, which included several significant renewals in Russia and China.", "With all the renewal activity in the second half of 2017, client incentive growth will be substantially higher in the first half of fiscal 2018, moderating significantly by the fourth quarter. This will be further compounded by two major renewals we currently anticipate will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as the completion of Europe rebate-to-incentive contract conversions, which have shifted into the first half of 2018. The Europe rebate-to-incentive contract conversions that shifted from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 lowered FY 2017 incentives as a percent of gross revenues by 50 basis points and correspondingly increased fiscal 2018 incentives as a percent of gross revenues by almost 50 basis points.", "When you put this all together, our outlook is for high single-digit nominal net revenue growth in fiscal 2018, which includes the currency translation tailwind of between 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Net revenue growth in the first half is anticipated to be a couple of points below the full-year run rate and in the double digits in the second half. Net revenue growth is expected to be highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the second quarter. This is a result of all the factors I just went through.", "In terms of currency translation tailwind of 50 basis points to 100 basis points, the dollar is not weakening across all currencies. We're benefiting from dollar weakness most significantly versus the euro. As a reminder, since the euro is a functional currency, we do not hedge our exposure to the euro. Relative to the pound, weakness of the dollar hurts revenues, but this is largely offset by the expenses we have denominated in pounds. The dollar is also weaker versus other important currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollar. As you know, we hedge some of our exposure to these currencies, which offset losses when they weaken and vice-versa.", "The dollar, however, remains strong or continues to strengthen versus the yen and a broad range of emerging market currencies like the Argentinian peso. We are unhedged on many of these emerging market currencies since they cannot be economically hedged. The net impact of all this is the 50 to 100 basis point impact we currently estimate based on spot rates and forward curves. As always, currencies will fluctuate.", "On the expense front, we're investing in a set of key initiatives that Al described, by partially funding these investments, by shifting resources from lower priority areas, as well as from savings we derive from better purchasing and other efficiency programs. In aggregate, fiscal 2018 operating expense growth adjusted for special items in fiscal year 2017 is projected to be in the mid-single-digit range.", "Included in our expenses is another $60 million in non-recurring cost related to the technology integration of Visa Europe. In fiscal 2018, we expect to start migrating clients to the global Visa technology platform. We have also included expenses related to getting our processing infrastructure up and running in China. Of course, it remains difficult to predict exactly what the timing will be on incurring these China expenses.", "Expense growth cadence through the year will also not be uniform. Adjusted expense growth will be in the high single digits in the first half and the low single digits in the second half due to various factors. Coming out of our organization restructuring at Visa Europe and globally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, personnel expenses were low in the first quarter of 2017 and ramped up through the year.", "In addition, bonus accruals stepped up through the year as it became apparent that business performance was exceeding our expectations. We have the Winter Olympics in the second quarter, which will result in higher marketing expenses versus Q2 last year. The Europe integration cost is also first half loaded as we complete the technology platform harmonization and start client migration.", "Finally, many of our investment initiatives ramped up through the second half of fiscal 2017, and spend rates on these initiatives will be higher in the first half of fiscal 2018 than they were in the first half of last year. The adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter and the lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted tax rate in 2017 was almost 30%, helped by the part-year benefits from the legal entity reorganization we completed midyear.", "Our outlook projects 100 basis points reduction in our tax rate for fiscal 2018 since we will get the full year benefit of the tax reorganization. This tax rate outlook does not include any impact from possible tax reform. Putting all these components together, our outlook is for EPS growth at the high end of mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes 1 to 1.5 points of positive foreign currency translation impact.", "As mentioned earlier, the underspend on client incentives in Europe with some renewal shifting into FY 2018 added approximately 1 percentage point to EPS growth in fiscal 2017 and will reduce EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point in fiscal 2018. With net revenue and operating expense growth rates fluctuating from quarter-to-quarter, EPS growth rates will, too. The EPS growth rate based on all these assumptions will be lowest in the second quarter, below the low end of the mid-teens range and at the highest level for the year in the fourth quarter, well above the mid-teens range. In the first and third quarters, we anticipate mid-teens EPS growth.", "We know all this quarterly fluctuation does not make it easy for you to build your model. We wanted to give you as much color as we could, and we'll, of course, update our outlook each quarter as we normally do as well as provide a point of view on the upcoming quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our outlook is for net revenue growth a couple of points below the full year rate, high single-digit operating expense growth and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth.", "Moving on to capital, cash flow, dividends and buybacks. Capital spending in fiscal 2018 is likely to be around $800 million. This includes capital associated with the Europe technology integration, capital to set up processing operations in China and spending on hardware to support growth as well as capitalization of software from our technology development projects.", "Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $9 billion. Most of this free cash flow will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The Visa board has authorized an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.195 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In line with our stated dividend policy, this puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range.", "We anticipate buying back over $7 billion of Visa stock during fiscal 2018. As you know, we've been buying stock in excess of our normal buybacks from free cash flow since the Visa Europe acquisition to neutralize the impact from stock issued to Visa Europe members. In fiscal 2018, we will complete this aspect of our buyback program.", "As I mentioned earlier, we issued $2.5 billion in debt in three tranches with a weighted average maturity of 14 years. After redeeming our December 2017 two-year notes, gross debt now stands at $16.75 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio is in the 1.2x to 1.5x range we are targeting, but towards the lower end of the range as EBITDA has grown.", "Since we stretched out maturities and added some indebtedness, interest expense will increase 10% in fiscal 2018. After we completed our legal entity reorganization, we have returned a net $5 billion in offshore cash to the U.S. At the end of September, total cash on hand including marketable securities stood at $15.3 billion.", "This includes cash from the September debt issue. We used $1.5 billion of this cash in October to redeem all of our two-year notes. We're monitoring developments from the tax reform front as we develop strategies to return more cash back to the U.S.", "We will adopt the new revenue recognition standard on October 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal 2019. If applied to fiscal 2017 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been immaterial. The impact to future years is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed going forward and will, therefore, vary.", "We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout fiscal 2018 and provide you an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business.", "In summary, the power of the Visa business model enhanced by the acquisition of Visa Europe delivered 22% net revenue and adjusted EPS growth in fiscal year 2017. Europe contributed with mid-single-digit EPS accretion.", "At the end of the first year post-acquisition, Visa Europe is well ahead of our revenue projection, below our cost projection with a lower effective tax rate. If we achieve the goals we have for Europe in fiscal year 2018, cumulative EPS accretion will be in the high single digits, and operating margins will be at or above Visa Inc. margins. We're poised to deliver another year of the robust revenue and earnings growth we have come to expect from Visa while continuing to invest in our business at healthy levels to sustain this growth into the future.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "And with that, we're ready to take questions, Kevin.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, speakers. Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you, good morning. I appreciate all the color on 2018, Vasant. I was just wondering if you could talk about what your expectations are for Visa Europe's accretion in 2018. And when we think about sort of where the surprises could be, it sounded like in 2017, it was on the expenses. Should we assume like in 2018, it could be more on the pricing side? Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yes. As I mentioned, it was sort of mid-single digits accretion in 2017 and cumulatively getting to the high single digits, so you could say once again, it adds probably in a low single digits accretion in 2018, so generally in that ballpark. So as you know, that's ahead of where we expected to be at this stage.", "No, I would say as Al said to that, 2017 performance was driven as much by revenue as expenses. So the revenue picture has been strong in Europe for two reasons. The local economies, they have been strong, and cross-border was particularly strong in Europe in 2017 because of the weak pound and the euro, a lot of cross border into the U.K. especially.", "And as we look at 2018, the economic situation in Europe at least as we look at it still looks very strong at a local level and the cross-border business is holding up. So it's going to be, again, I think revenue being a major driver of it. I don't know, Al, if you have something else.", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "No, I think that's fair. I think as I said, we're bullish on Europe, and I think it's a combination of what we're getting done on the revenue side and the expense side.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "And of course, we got the legal entity reorganization done, which meant that the effective tax rate on our European earnings is lower than what we might have expected immediately post the transaction.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on that. The high single-digit EPS accretion by 2018, that will be two years earlier than the original plan. I think it was for high single digits by fiscal year 2020. Just thinking about going forward into 2019 and 2020, is there some upside now to the original guidance on EPS accretion in Europe now that we're ahead of plan and there is probably more to do in the out-years? Thanks.", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "Bryan, I think we're, at this point, laser beam focused on 2018 and trying to take this in one step at a time. I think we feel very good about where we ended 2017. We feel very good about where we think we're going to head in 2018. And hopefully, there's a trend there. But right now, we're focused on 2018 and getting to that next step in terms of the value that Europe is delivering to the entire Visa enterprise.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, Kevin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks, good morning. So I had a question on the high 60s margin guidance for 2018. I appreciate all the expense color you guys gave. Historically, that's been a mid-60s number. And the question really is the business model at a kind of pivot point, whereby you really just can't kind of outrun the incremental margin anymore with really the pace of investment or is this just kind of a one-off, where we're going to be running in the high 60s? Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "I think as we've always said, we don't have margins as an objective. We focus on driving volumes. Clearly, the focus is on converting cash, driving volumes, driving revenues. As long as revenues are growing in the high single digits and with the appropriate level of investment given the nature of our cost structure, expenses are growing in the mid-single digits, you're going to get margin improvement. And margins are not an objective. It's an outcome. And Al?", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "I think the only other dynamic I'd remind you of, Dan, is that we're seeing based on the actions we're taking fairly good margin expansion in Europe, which is now a part of the overall mix of the margin number for all of Visa. But other than that, I would agree totally with Vasant's comment, which is we're going to invest at the level that makes sense and we feel good about and margins as an outcome, not a goal.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning. Al, sort of a longer-term question. If you look around the world at what's going on with Alipay and real-time payments, at some point, do you get worried that there could be some leakage to the secular opportunity or do you feel like that is something that's premature in terms of worrying about?", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "Don, I think a good characteristic of any CEO is to be a bit paranoid. And while we just talked about very, very strong results in FY 2017, I can tell you that we are really laser-focused on the future and the fact that there are disruptive forces in the marketplace.", "I think that as it relates to real-time payments, I think we feel like we've got a very good tool in our toolbox in terms of Visa Direct. And as I said in my remarks, we saw volume on Visa Direct rise 75% year over year. The likes of Alipay and WeChat have done a phenomenal job in China and have started to migrate to other geographies. And you can rest assured that it is something that we pay a tremendous amount of attention to, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we remain a key player at the focal point of the payments ecosystem.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. I just wanted to ask on cross-border. Can you walk us through the reconciling items in Q4 between volume growth and revenue growth? At least in our model, the big revenue upside was on cross-border. And then just any thoughts or comments around the intra-quarter cross-border volume slowdown through October 21? I know it's only a few weeks of data, but any callouts there? Thanks.", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to as far as the volume and revenue growth aspects of the fourth quarter. There was nothing unusual in the fourth quarter. It was a pretty steady growth quarter. There should not be anything unusual there unless I'm not fully understanding your question.", "As far as it relates to the first three weeks of October, we've said over and over again in the past that three weeks don't make a trend. Having said that, why is the number 7.4%? There's a little bit of shift in what are these intra-Europe cross-border volumes that accounts for probably 1.5 points or so of the difference from last quarter. Intra-Europe, sometimes acquirers and merchants can shift where they acquire the volume, and that can cause something that was considered an intra-Europe transaction to a domestic transaction. It doesn't have much of a revenue impact, but we do see that within the EU.", "The other factors are really driven more by a strengthening dollar causing some slowdowns, as I said in my comments, on outbound commerce from the U.S. and some limited impact from what's happening in the Caribbean and Mexico. But again, there's a lot going on in cross-border with these currency shifts, and we'll just have to wait and see. We feel pretty good about it.", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "The only thing I'd add is again, a small impact, but it's the lapping of some of the U.S. conversions.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, Kevin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Al, just a question about Europe. You gave pretty bullish commentary on the outlook for Europe, and in particular highlighting the disparity across countries there with card penetration or digital payment penetration. But that is the region also where there is prevalence in some countries of these bank transfer-based networks that have gotten a lot of traction. Can you walk through your view on how debit goes head to head versus these networks? What's the difference in functionality? What's the difference in the value proposition to the merchant, to the issuer, et cetera?", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "Lisa, thank you for the question. I think I mentioned I'm heading to London right after this call, and this is actually something that's on our agenda to discuss. The issue you raise is real. I think in the case of Europe, as a reminder, the bulk of our business or a large percentage of our business is in the UK. And as we actually look to penetrate further into the continent, we're going to have to make sure that we have strong offerings in credit as well as debit. And we, by the way, tend to be even further behind in credit in some markets than we are in the case of debit. And we're going to have to make sure that our value propositions are differentiated in certain ways to make sure that we are indeed a player. But there's no question that these country-based networks are something we're going to have to contend with.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. A two-part question, but first, I understand you have more tough compares in 2018, including higher incentives as a catch-up, but fourth quarter did sow some of that increase in incentives already obviously, and yet you were able to do 14% growth. So just are the other factors like pricing enough for the difference down to high single digits in guide?", "And then just a longer-term part of the question is, I guess incentives are guided up again. If we took out the idea of a catch-up, again, bigger picture, should investors expect a more normalized growth in incentives after 2018 just based on pricing environment seeming to be somewhat stable in the overall market? So just bigger picture comments on incentives growth after the catch-up.", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "In the case of the first question, the guidance we're giving is our best assessment of where we see the business going at this point in time for 2018 with all of the various information that we have at our hands. In terms of the client incentives question, Vasant?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "On the first part of your question, which is your revenue growth was 14% despite incentives being 21.7%, I just want to make sure you heard what I said about the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2017, while we were lapping Europe in 2016, the rebates were still in place in the fourth quarter of 2016. So it's not apples-to-apples yet for Europe on the revenue front because the rebates stop being paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. So you really only have to get out of the first quarter of 2017 where you're comparing Europe one year to the other in a real apples-to-apples way. That's number one.", "Number two, we went through some of the Costco/USAA comparatives. So there are a couple of factors that make the fourth quarter that we just had have things in it that are not going to be like what you've seen in the first quarter and beyond next year.", "As it relates to incentives, yes, some of it is the shift. But as you know, we just went through in Europe a large number of what we call contract conversions from rebates to incentives. All those now flow through the incentive line next year, so clearly that's a factor. And then we had, as you heard, several large renewals this year. That flows through. And we don't really want to comment on what happens in 2019 and beyond. But as Al said, we've given you the best picture we can of what to expect in 2018.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the data processing line. That line has consistently done better than we expected. And I think on the last call, Vasant, you referred to the fact that you had picked up some specific wins. Can you maybe just kind of frame that line and the expectations for 2018 and beyond in terms of where you might be thinking of market share, in what regions and if Europe is specifically a possibility for further share gains there?", "Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.", "Yeah. I wouldn't emphasize share gains per se. Yes, we had a gain in Europe, which did help the growth rate in that line. But data processing has been a very healthy business. It's a great business. As I think Al mentioned, we would like to increase processing around the world. It has been growing in that 13% range all year while clearly having Costco and USAA come in the U.S. helped that, too. As we look ahead, we said we'd see a little bit of a step-down because of these lapping effects but still healthy double-digit growth. Beyond that, there really wasn't anything remarkable there. It's just a good, strong, fast growth business.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette. Your line is now open. One moment please.", "James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "...with regulators in Europe has been...", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "I'm sorry. You just came in with the first part of the question. Can you start again?", "James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Sure. Hey. This is James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Al, it's a question for you. You mentioned in your prepared comments that your engagement with regulators perhaps is most active in Europe, and I'm wondering if you can just give a little bit of color as to what you view as the objectives of the regulators in Europe and the pieces that Visa can have that can help address the things that regulators are looking at. And I guess, as part of that, just give an update as to what you're seeing with your partners as \u2013 with PSD2, et cetera. Thanks.", "Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.", "So I think there's a number of objectives that the regulators have. They're looking for \u2013 to protect the privacy of consumers. They're looking to make sure that transactions are as secure as they possibly can be. They're looking to create and foster more innovation and allowing FinTechs to get into the stream a bit more, and that's facilitating the idea of opening up access to bank accounts around Europe as defined in PSD2. So I think that what the regulators are trying to accomplish is relatively clear.", "I think where it all lands and what the various use cases that might develop is probably less clear. We focus on a couple of things. One is making sure that we are having good open dialog with the regulators so that they understand our point of views and have clarity around what exists that's good in the payments ecosystem and how the payments ecosystem is evolving.", "Secondly, we're working closely with our clients, particularly issuers and acquirers, around Europe to understand what are some of the implications and frankly, what are potentially some of the opportunities, making sure that we help them as they try to meet the authentication hurdles that the regulators want people to achieve as well as understanding the implications of PSD2 and open access to accounts and what that might mean. And I think we have found ourselves having excellent dialog with clients throughout Europe, and it's something that we'll be continuing to focus on. I actually will meet with regulators tomorrow when I'm in London.", "Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.", "And with that, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has follow-up questions, please feel free to call myself or Joon. Thanks, again. Have a great day.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joon Huh, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Huh, you may now begin.", "Joon Huh", "Thanks, Athena. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.", "This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. Our slide deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website.", "Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements.

As always, Vasant and I are going to make some relatively brief comments on our results and then we'll open up to whatever questions you have on your minds.", "We're off to a solid start in our fiscal year and I'm pleased with our company's performance this past quarter. Our performance was driven by healthy economies around the world, growth and acceptance in the continue rise and E&M commerce, especially in developed countries. U.S. tax reforms certainly has and will continue to impact our business in positive ways. We have made a few initial decisions about our investments as a direct result of the lower corporate tax rate and we continue to talk about it, analyze additional incremental spending options to both, to our talent, our business, and the communities in which we work; all with the goal of fulfilling our corporate mission of helping individuals, businesses and economies thrive.", "Looking at our business drivers, payments volume grew 10% on a constant dollar basis as we saw healthy growth around the globe. The Central Europe, Middle East region led the way with 19% growth driven by the Gulf countries of the Middle East. Latin America was up 14% with particular strength coming from Argentina, Canada grew 11%, up 4% sequentially resulting from high gas prices and increased spending in retail and telecom. In the United States payments volume grew 10% driven by increases in consumer credit and holiday spending which I'll spend a few minutes on a bit later. Europe maintained a solid growth rate of 9% with strength coming from Turkey and Southeast Europe, and Asia Pacific grew 8% as we saw improved volumes from Australia and Taiwan. And although we're partially lapping that demand utilization in India, total process transactions continue to grow at double-digit rate of 12%.", "Turning to the financial metrics, net revenue grew 9% driven in part by strong holiday season and accelerating ecommerce growth. We saw good momentum in our cross-border business with revenue growth of 12% in constant dollar, volume growth of 9%. Despite the lapping of Brexit and a stronger currency dynamic, the European cross-border business performed better than we expected. In United States we saw a sequential increase in cross-border growth resulting from increased inbound activity as the dollar remained relatively weak throughout the quarter and the weak dollar trend has continued into the first few weeks of this quarter.", "Client incentives were 21.4% of gross revenue, roughly in line with the prior quarter. As we discussed in the last call, we're making significant investments in our business initiatives and our strategic priorities leading to increased expense levels in the quarter. And with the new U.S. tax reform in place, a portion of the benefit is reflected in our fiscal first quarter results, this will led to adjusted EPS growth of 26% which includes the benefits from tax reform. Vasant will go into greater detail in the impact of tax reform and provide more background on the numbers.", "Now let me provide some more color on the subject of U.S. holiday spending. The 2017 holiday season was stronger than the prior year as both consumer credit and debit grew at higher levels. Growth was driven by better performance in retail and entertainment which includes movies, gaming, fitness, sporting goods, recreational activities. Additionally, higher gas prices contributed to some of the growth. Both offline and online volume had higher growth rates than the prior year with online growing approximately four times faster than offline. During the holiday season, ecommerce continued to gain share jumping to over 30% of consumer U.S. holiday volume. Ecommerce growth was strong across a number of categories but was more significantly strengthened by retail performance.", "Interestingly, the retail spending was stronger earlier in the holiday season, the couple of weeks prior to Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving week looked quite a bit stronger than the growth we saw in the prior year. Beyond the U.S. when we look at some of the other markets and their holiday seasons, growth was better than last year in Brazil, Australia and Canada, that was essentially flat in the United Kingdom.", "Turning to our business activity, we had another business quarter for announcements; we are very pleased to expand our global leadership position in the co-brand arena with the launches of the Starbucks and Uber programs. Additionally, we renewed our strong and long-term partnership with Marriott. Additionally, we had a good pipeline of renewals across the world. We also advanced our digital products, most notably; we announced the part issue with Facebook in October as they joined our Visa digital enablement program to use our token service to accelerate payment services on the digital properties. With this partnership Visa clients used on Facebook Messenger who now be tokenized and therefore the account numbers are not exposed. This partnership furthers our efforts to encrypt and devalue payment information in the payments ecosystem. Additionally, this partnership advances our effort to enable and develop new digital commerce experiences as consumers spend more time in messaging environments like Facebook.", "In November we launched Visa Direct in Europe which provides real time push payment solutions for person to person, business to business and business to consumer applications leveraging our global network. The advantage of Visa Direct is that it utilizes our existing network connections, rules, operations and key controls that are built into the network such as transaction limits and sanctions screening. Because of this tactical and operational leverage, the time and cost of implementation is lower than many alternative options. As we stated previously, we believe that Visa Direct is a key product to enable fast payments across Europe.", "More recently, we initiated a small pilot for new biometric cards for contactless payments which provides an alternative to pin or signature authentication. This is the first commercial pilot to test an on-card biometric for contactless payments. We're committed to ensuring secure, fast and convenient payments at the point of sale. And core to delivering on this commitment is to continually evolve the marketplace in terms of dynamic authentication methods such as EMV chip and an indication of these pilots investing in emerging capabilities that leverage biometrics.", "As we stated before, we always want to make strategic investments that will drive long-term growth for our business, with that objective we're making investments in the area of contactless transactions and authentication methods as this is the natural evolution following the adoption of the EMV infrastructure. Consumer research and internal data has shown that there is a strong interest for contactless payments as it creates a faster and more convenient experience at the point of sale. We've seen significant adoption in markets like Australia, UK and Canada and we hope to increase adoption in other markets. We're especially excited about the U.S. market given the build out of the EMV infrastructure that will allow us to go with the market forward and towards contactless transactions.", "Echoing my earlier remarks, the recent tax reform will create benefits and opportunities for our business. We're exploring the range of options and we're prioritizing long-term sustainable investments versus one-time actions. One of the areas we're most focused on is our employees and talent development as this is the foundation of our business. As the first step we enhanced our benefits for U.S. based employees and increased our company contribution to the U.S. 401(k) program given the importance of retirement planning. This allows U.S. employees to enjoy a sustained benefit consisted with the ongoing contribution that they make every day to build our business for our clients, partners and shareholders.", "Additionally, we're exploring other global benefits and investments for our business around the world. Throughout the year we will continue to make strategic investments in our people and the areas of digital products, technology operations and merchant solutions as we position the company for long-term sustainable growth. Additionally, in light of tax reform, the board increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.21 per share, ultimately using funds to grow our business organically however is the top objective for our capital allocation here at Visa.", "Last year we evolved our global social impact strategy and announced the formation of the Visa Foundation. Funds available through the foundation will help drive real progress across the world with a primary focus on helping micro and small enterprises thrive through access, growth and resilience. I'm pleased to say that the foundation made an inaugural grab to this past quarter to the Women's World Banking; this grant will help support the millions of women-led small and micro enterprises which are underserved financially around the world.", "Let me spend a few minutes on the international front. In Europe we are making good progress on our ongoing integration efforts and identifying areas for growth. We're working closely with our clients as we've now resolved over 80% of the contracts moving to commercial incentives. In terms of the tactical integration we expect Visa net migration to begin this quarter and continue throughout 2018. We have planned carefully with our clients to ensure the highest standards of preparation and testing for the months leading upto the migration with regular update with the business leaders to ensure a smooth and stable migration. Once the migration is completed, we'll be able to deliver new products, services and capabilities to the region bringing the best of our global capabilities to our European clients.", "As I mentioned on the last call, I was going to spend additional time with the European leadership team in planning and strategy meetings this past quarter. Having spent 3 of the last 6 weeks in Europe, it reinforced my belief that there is still meaningful growth opportunities in the region. Few remarks about India; we have a market leading position in debit and credit with significant share in both categories. After partially lapping the impact of demonetization, we saw domestic payments volume grow over 20% and process transactions grow 12% in the past quarter. We continue to engage with the regulators, the government and our clients to ensure sustainability of the economics and we are investing and partnering with issuers, acquirers and the government to grow electronic payments. We have crossed 3 million acceptance points and are working to scale up contact list and broad QR usage and acceptance points.", "As we look at our capital allocation plans, our top priority as I said earlier continues to be investing for the future growth of our business to deliver shareholder value. In addition though, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In fiscal Q1 we returned $2.2 billion of capital consisting of $1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $460 million in dividends. As I stated on our last call, we expect to return over $9 billion of capital to shareholders this fiscal year. I already talked about the dividend increase to $0.21 per share; the Board on Tuesday also authorized an additional $7.5 billion share repurchase program resulting in a current authorization level of $9.1 billion.", "In closing, we're off to a solid start to our fiscal year. I'm pleased with our consistent business execution and excited about the many growth prospects we had. And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant who will cover some of the financial details.", "Vasant Prabhu", "Thank you, Al. We had a solid start to fiscal year '18 with GAAP EPS growth of 25% and adjusted EPS growth of 26%. Implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act added approximately 9 percentage points to this adjusted growth rate which I will discuss in more detail in few minutes.", "Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, EPS growth was 17%. Net revenue growth was 9%. Growth of key business drivers, payments volume, cross model volume and process transactions remained strong and stable across the globe. As a reminder, several significant factors have a meaningful impact on year-over-year revenue growth comparisons this quarter. First, and by far the most significant factor, rebates to Visa Europe members ended beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year '17, so this is the first quarter of apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe. This affects reported service fees, data processing and international revenue. We are also at apples-to-apples growth comparisons for Costco and USAA credit.", "The India demonetization impact started in November 2016, so we partially lapped that in Q1 and finally, fiscal year '18 price increases which are smaller in scope than fiscal year '17 increases will go into effect in the second half of the year. In fiscal year '17 our U.S. price increase went into effect in the first quarter and international increases went into effect mostly in the second quarter.", "A few other items of note; we bought back 15.5 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $110.67 or $1.72 billion this quarter. Our board has authorized a new $7.5 billion share repurchase program, including this additional authorization we now have $9.1 million available for share repurchases. In addition, our board has increased the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share at almost 8% increase commensurate with higher earnings potential of the company post tax reform. This is in addition to the 18% increase in the dividend last quarter. Finally, in October 2017 we used the proceeds from our September debt offering to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in December 2017.", "A quick review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter; payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10%, even the growth from Costco and USAA credit on an apples-to-apples basis, U.S. growth accelerated one point increasing from 9% in the fourth quarter to 10% in the first quarter; this reflects solid underlying growth from a strong holiday season, particularly in the credit business. Credit was up 11%, debit was up 8%, adjusted for conversions, underlying growth rates for both credit and debit stepped up. As Al described, we saw higher growth in consumer payments volume this holiday season driven by acceleration in retail and entertainment spending, especially online, as well as rising gas prices.", "International payments volume growth in constant dollars was stable at 10%. Growth rate stepped up in Canada, Australia, across Latin America and the Middle East. The rate of decline in Chinese dual branded card volumes slowed, this was offset to some extent by the impact of lapping India demonetization. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 9%, this is one point lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal '17, primarily due to the drag from an ecommerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK cardholder volume to the UK from another EU location. The total impact of the shift that we first mentioned in July is greater than 3 point reduction in our reported cross-border constant dollar growth rate. This shift is only a minor effect on revenue since it is an intra-EU move the platform made to optimize its European business.", "U.S. outbound spend also slowed moderately as the dollar weakened. As we expected, growth of inbound commerce into the U.S. picked up at the weakening dollar. Inbound commerce into Europe remained robust but growth slowed as we lacked the weakening of both, the pound and euro after the Brexit vote. Growth in outbound spend from the Caribbean has returned to more typical levels after the hurricanes. However, inbound spend remains weak as travellers choose other destination while many of the islands recover.", "Process transaction growth of 12% is down one percentage point versus last quarter, largely driven by partially lapping India demonetization. Through January 28, constant dollar U.S. payments values growth was 9%, U.S. credit growing 10% and debit 8%. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis was up 11%, process transactions grew 11%.", "A brief review of fiscal first quarter financial results; net revenue grew 9%. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue growth deceleration versus the prior quarter is driven by several significant factors, particularly the removal of European rebates. Exchange rate shifts helped Q1 net revenue growth by around one point. Incentives as a percent of growth revenues at 21.4% added a lower end of our outlook range this quarter but up 2.5 percentage point from last year as Europe contract conversion and other renewals during the second half of fiscal year '17 impact us in fiscal year '18. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as the percentage of growth revenues in the remaining quarters based on the timing of renewals. We're on-track to complete conversion of contracts in Europe from rebates to incentives by the end of the second quarter.", "Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily driven by personnel costs. As a reminder, personnel expenses were low in the first quarter of fiscal year '17 and ramped up through the year. We have some expenses that are first half loaded including the Winter Olympics in the second quarter as well as Europe integration costs as we complete the technology platform harmonization and start client migrations. Our spend rate on investment initiative is higher in the first half of fiscal year '18 than they were during the first half last year since we ramped up many of these investments during the second half of fiscal year '17. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal year '18 operating expenses were higher than we expected due to some timing shifts and some non-recurring items.", "Non-operating expenses were lower than expected due to higher interest income on our cash balances, as well as a gain on the sale of an investment. Our tax rate for the quarter on a GAAP basis was 22.1%, this included two special items related to the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First, we had 1.13 billion onetime non-cash tax benefit from re-measuring our net deferred tax liabilities based on the new corporate tax rate. Second, we had an offsetting 1.15 billion charge related to the transition tax. In moving to the new territorial system, the tax [ph] requires a transition tax on previously untaxed deferred foreign income; this tax which is payable over 8 years is 15.5% on the amounts held in cash and cash equivalents and 8% on the remaining non-cash amount. These two items are estimated based on the information available to us at this time and maybe adjusted over the year as we analyze additional information and guidance.", "Adjusted to exclude these two items, our effective tax rate was 21.7%. Both, the GAAP and adjusted tax rate was 6 percentage points lower because of the lower corporate tax rate. Implementation of the tax act added $0.07 to our GAAP EPS and $0.08 to our adjusted EPS in the first quarter. This translates to 9 percentage points of additional EPS growth. Exchange rate shifts added one point to reported EPS growth.", "With that, I'll move to our updated outlook. We are revising our fiscal year '18 outlook for the impact of U.S. tax reform. Let me briefly start with what is not changing. Annual net revenue growth is still expected to be in the high single-digits on nominal dollar basis. This includes one half to one percentage point of positive foreign currency impact. The impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese Yen, the Brazilian Real and the Mexican Peso is offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the euro and the pound. The quarterly cadence of revenue growth remains unchanged versus our prior expectations.", "Our outlook for the fiscal second quarter net revenue growth remains a couple of points below the full year rate. We also reiterated our outlook for client incentive as a percent of growth revenues in the 21.5% to 22.5% range, an annual operating margin in the high 60s.", "Now to what is changing; our GAAP and effective tax rate is expected to be 6 points lower or approximately 23% for fiscal year '18. This is driven by the reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate on our U.S. taxable income from 35% to 21%. This benefit from the reduction in the federal tax rate is partially offset by deductions that are no longer available and a lower benefit for state taxes paid. The 6 percentage point reduction of our fiscal year '18 tax rate represents three quarters of the lower U.S. federal tax rate starting January 1, 2018 through the end of our fiscal year in September. The annualized reduction in our tax rate is 8 percentage points. As such, we will have another 2 point reduction in our overall tax rate in fiscal year '19.", "The tax reduction could be partially offset by new provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act that go into effect in 2019 such as the repeal of Section 199 deduction. The 13.1% floor on global intangible low taxed income, as well as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax. We'll be doing the work to assess the impacts of these provisions over the next few months and update you as we have better estimates. At this point we expect an additional 1 to 2 percentage point reduction in our fiscal year '19 tax rate over and above the 6 percentage point benefit we realized in fiscal year '18 as a result of U.S. tax reform.", "We plan to reinvest approximately 1 percentage point of pretax earnings in our business and our people. Al mentioned the change we made to our 401(k) matching contributions to U.S. employees. We are evaluating additional investments with a focus on actions that will drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. We anticipate that this additional investment will increase our operating expense growth in fiscal year '18 by approximately 2 percentage points to the high end of mid-single digits adjusted for special items in fiscal year '17. We are still expecting operating expense growth to be higher in the first half and lower during the second half for all of the reasons we discussed previously. Double-digit growth in operating expenses is expected to continue into the second fiscal quarter.", "The impact of these changes on our EPS outlook for fiscal year '18 is approximately 9 to 10 points. We now expect EPS growth to be at the high end of the mid-20s range on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This still includes 1 to 1.5 points of positive foreign currency translation impact. We project adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $10 billion, up $900 million from what we estimated last quarter, this is largely driven by U.S. tax reform. Our quarterly dividend at $0.21 is 27% higher than our fiscal year '17 quarterly dividend. We have over $9 billion available for stock buybacks, we continue to anticipate buying back over $7 billion of Visa stock during fiscal year '18.", "We ended the quarter with global cash-on-hand including marketable securities of $14.1 billion of which $6.3 billion is currently offshore. During the quarter we returned $1.8 billion of non-U.S. cash back to the U.S. We're working on additional actions to further reduce our offshore cash in fiscal year 2018. As a reminder, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard on October 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal 2019. If applied to the first quarter of fiscal year '18 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been small. The impact to fiscal year '19 is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed and will therefore vary. We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout fiscal year '18 and provide an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business.", "In summary, fiscal year 2018 is off to a strong start underpinned by a healthy global economic environment. The shift away from cash to digital forms of payments remains a powerful secular trend. Europe performance and integration plans remain on-track. Our outlook for operating performance remains unchanged, tax reform in the U.S. will add 9 to 10 points to EPS growth after the additional investments we're planning. We remain committed to our state-owned [ph] hold capital allocation strategies, our Board has raised the quarterly dividend again this quarter to reflect the higher earnings potential of Visa post tax reform, and we have over $9 billion in authorization to fund our stock buyback plans.", "With that, I will turn this back to Joon.", "Joon Huh", "And with that Athena, we are ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Tenjing [ph] of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I thought I'd ask on U.S. debit; it looks like growth has settled in pretty nicely actually around 8% the last two quarters. Is this a good clean rate to assume for U.S. debit as we look ahead? And I also wanted to meaning to ask you guys, since your decision too no longer require a signature, a checkout in the U.S.; what's the opportunity there, how does this change the dynamic of pin versus signature and all that good stuff? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.", "Alfred Kelly", "On the first question, obviously we're not going to forecast ahead but U.S. debit has been performing quite well and as I said in my remarks, debit as well as credit looked very good in the holiday season. In terms of your second question, the reality is that the vast majority of transactions in United States didn't require a signature anyway because of the number -- especially in debit because the requirements of not having to take signature for under $25 or under $50 transaction. Our decision which -- we took a very thoughtful approach to ended up being at least a little bit different than our competitors where we said that we're going to move to no signature where somebody has set up for EMV. We actually think we need to be continue to encourage adoption of EMV for security reasons and therefore made the requirement that it's no signature as long as your merchant is EMV enabled.", "And we continue to believe that we've got a good roadmap for debit but I would say these things are unrelated, largely, and the reality is that we think we made a good decision for consumers. I'd also add that I still think there is a place for signature in a number of cases, high ticket items I think -- as we've done a lot of consumer research, consumers want to be able to validate and merchants want to be able to validate that transaction. Also consumers and in situations like keeping [ph] situations where they are adding to the base amount, also prefer to be able to continue to use the signature; so while there is no signature required we do expect that a number of merchants in specific situations will continue to request the signature from consumers and consumers will want to provide that signature.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of David [ph] of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Could you update us on your strategy to expand Visa Europe into some of the higher growth markets where you're less well representative, for example, Nordics, Italy and Germany?", "Alfred Kelly", "Well, I've said in my remarks I've been over there 3 of the last 6 weeks and I think that we have largely built out our leadership team and are very far along on the strategy for Europe. And you're absolutely right, David; if you look at our business in Europe, obviously we have very strong position in the UK, in France, we have a good position in Spain but there are 34 other markets in Europe, at least there is we -- as we establish -- how the way we established Europe and there is a lot of opportunity in the markets. You mentioned plus Italy, plus Germany, and we're in the midst of actually staffing up in a number of markets. In terms of personnel, one of my objectives is to ultimately have less people in the regional hub in London and more out in the markets where the action is. But we -- between bringing our digital products into Europe, Visa Direct, Visa Token Services; as well as adding personnel and building our relationship with issuers, Charlotte Hogg, our new European CEO has spent a tremendous amount of time in the four months she has been with the company out talking to our clients throughout Europe.", "So I actually -- absolutely believe that Europe, particularly on the continent represents great opportunity for us and the beginnings of what will be a journey to build our business to a much stronger position on the continent.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned launched Visa Direct in Europe; could you talk about your broader strategy for PSD2, at Analyst Day you mentioned keeping your options open, potentially buying a PS [ph] -- I'd be curious for what your thoughts are currently?", "Alfred Kelly", "I think as we said then and I think we've been consistent, look PSD2 is kind of a long-term play and I think it's going to take a while to see how it's actually going to play out. We actually think we're pretty well positioned as it relates to PSD2 coming into Europe. The strong customer authentication is going to require and put a premium on risk and authorization capabilities which is a strong point of the whole ability to have third-party accessed accounts I think was a premium on -- and outstanding payment experience and that's something that we tried ourselves in working closely what our issues are and this probably new consumer experience is that we'll emerge as a result of the PSD2 legislation and I think -- again, we feel like we're well positioned to work with our issuers partners on it. So I think this is going to be a very slow build overtime but I think we feel like we're well positioned as it relates to this regulation going into place in Europe.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Darrin Peller", "Just starting off, I mean it looks like there is a round of billing in dollar benefit from tax reform that you can see over the course of the year just based on the tax rates you're giving us now. I know you talked about some specific items like retirement contributions and investments in growth; I guess a little more specifics on breaking down that dollar amount in terms of your expectation on categories along with the sustainability beyond this year. And then Al, just when you think about market share here, I just love to hear your thoughts on -- if there is a good pipeline of things up for grabs, I mean just looking at one of your biggest competitors, the growth profile of some of their volumetrics were still higher, I'm just curious if it was anything that you see happening or is it just timing factors?", "Vasant Prabhu", "On the tax one, yes, just too sort of go through it again. The full benefit of the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% on annualized basis is 8 points. We get 6 points this year because we're getting three quarters of benefit. We'll get 2 points from the corporate tax reduction next year, we're just being a little cautious on the two points because of additional provisions that go in next year that we along with others are looking for more guidance on. We have an initial point of view on it but we're assuming it will change through the year. As you know, when you translate that, that is $1 billion after-tax benefit to us in lower cash taxes as a result of that. There are two things -- we can talk about four sort of things around how we want to deploy the cash.", "One, you've already heard us say that we've already made some decisions that will reinvest about a point of that reduction in taxes, meaning one point of our pretax income in our business in operating expenses, some of which you already heard about, things we're doing for employees, others in terms of adding to some of the investment programs that are already on the way, as well as some new initiatives. That will cause our expenses to grow a little bit more than we had originally anticipated, that expenses are essentially on-track for the year versus prior outlook. We're just with a deliberate strategy increasing it by 2 points as a result of tax reform.", "The second dimension is commensurate with the higher earnings potential of the company. We are stepping up the dividend, we already have a healthy buyback program with over $7 billion this year, this was reflecting the fact that we were buying back some of the stock issued to Visa Europe owners. Once we get past the $7 billion mark, we need to do more, we will evaluate it at that point. And then finally in terms of M&A and investments, as Al said, our priority is to invest in our business organic growth. The fact the tax rates are lower, certainly improves the ROI you can get on investments and the same on M&A. But we were not cash constraint before, so we're not going to change our posture other than the fact that lower taxes made investments more attractive.", "So I'm going to turn it back to Al if he wants to add to this and I'm sure he is going to talk about the other question.", "Alfred Kelly", "Look, we're not the type of company that can deploy capital organically, extraordinarily quickly but we've got a whole set of key investment areas that are driven off of our strategic pillars and we're going to continue to focus on those things, whether it's security in the ecosystem driving contactless expanding access, digital expansion, those will be the areas we focus on. In relationship to your second question on market share; I would say this, in my mind there is tremendous opportunity to grow in the medium and long-term and I think the opportunity is more. We're growing the market, bringing more people into the payments mainstream, expanding access by displacing cash and cheque. I think we've had a very good quarter, MasterCard had an excellent quarter; to me this isn't a quarter-by-quarter contest, we're driven and focused on sustained long-term growth for our investors overtime and I know it's a point out that I think looking at quarter-by-quarter comparisons can be really tricky, there is a whole bunch of factors that are different between us and some of our competitors, there is business mix differences, there is lapping dynamics, there is timing issues, there is wins and renewals and conversions and frankly, there is differential impact of exchange rates. So I look at it and say, I think medium to long-term opportunities are terrific, I think our fundamentals are very good and we feel good about the long-term prospects of the business.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "James Schneider", "Thanks for taking my question, maybe going back to the Europe topic for a second, if you think about your market share position within Europe, across both debit and credit, Al can you maybe opine on where you see opportunities to improve that position in terms of individual countries? And then as you think longer term, do you think that could come at the expense of local processors or more of your traditional peers?", "Alfred Kelly", "At this stage, I'm reluctant to get into [Technical Difficulty] A rebate structure and I think it's our expectation that we'll get through almost all of this, there might be a few lag or what gets through all of this by the end of this second quarter.", "Vasant Prabhu", "And in terms of pricing I think we've told you earlier that there is pricing but this year there is the pricing goes into effect in the second half. And then we'll evaluate further pricing actions in the future.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of Ramsey [ph] of Jefferies & Company. Your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Total process transaction growth was really heavy this quarter despite Indian demonetization last year. Can you give us your view on whether the progress made in India in terms of just the general electronification of payment is kind of a permanent inflexion point in that market or do you see the market reverting to cash usage overtime? There seems to be some media report with some consenting -- some kind of conflicting signals there.", "Alfred Kelly", "I was doing the baseball analogy; we're still in the first -- maybe the beginning of the second inning in India, there is just a long way to go. I've read some of the same reports but I think we have hit an inflexion point. We've seen a huge increase in acceptance points and volume over the course of the last -- I guess now 14 months. The government is very bullishly behind this and while we're through the demonetization period, there is a little bit more of the cash back in circulation. I think that the government is very desirous of having the efficiencies of more electronic digital transactions, as well as ideally getting past the point where they get rid of the grey economy in India and have more transparency from a tax perspective.", "So my view -- and obviously, you know, I know what I know which isn't everything and I think it is at inflexion point but while I say it's an inflexion point sometimes that -- we're well into the match racing curve of this, there is inflexion point there, there is a long, long way to go; 3 million merchants and the type of volume that we're add as much as the growth rate to very attractive, it is very small compared to where India will ultimately be.", "Vasant Prabhu", "And just in terms of metrics, that would -- going to your question about is this permanent, yes, there is a lot more cash in the economy because cash is back to normal but as Al said, the number of acceptance points has doubled and people are not pulling back the government or the banks or all of us are still pressing hard on building acceptance. There are more people using cards, that's a measurable metric and then there is more people using cards with a higher frequency and that's a measureable metric and the real test will be once we fully lap the demonetization, what is still the growth rate and we'll tell you more next quarter.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I actually also had a question on India and the terminalization of that market. Al, can you give us a little sense of how much the tax related savings might go into helping terminalize that market?", "Alfred Kelly", "I don't know that -- first of all, money has become plungable but we're already investing fairly heavily in India, it's one of the markets -- as I look around the world, it's one of our largest markets in terms of deployment of people. And I'm talking about people in the market, I'm not counting the 950 people we have at a technology center in Bangalore. And we were planning to grow our India presence in our plan before tax reform. Look, we've turned back to all of our regional leaders and Vasant and I have been asking people to tell us where they potentially could put money to work in a very smart way that's going to drive growth against the type of areas that we're already investing and in India, certainly one of the main areas of growth is building out acceptance, which might in some cases be physical terminals, in many cases it will be continued use of rolling out QR technology and MVisa apps for consumers. So I think it's safe to assume that India is going to continue to be an area that we're going to look to invest in and it's highly possible but decision not made for sure that we'll -- as a result of facts reform we might put a bit more money into that market.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of Chris [ph] of Buckingham. Your line is now open.", "Alfred Kelly", "Athena, I think we have a bad connection. Can we move to the next question?", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "James Faucette", "First, I wanted to dig in really quickly -- can you just talk about cross-border and how you're thinking about getting to your expectations, especially since I've seen to decelerate maybe a little bit at least on [indiscernible]? And then more broadly for -- I think Amir [ph] was mentioning that the Analyst meeting a couple of quarters back that you thought that on there could be acceleration and beat this business over the medium term and in part driven by increasing B2B opportunities. I'm wondering looking out at that medium to long run, where we should be looking for those B2B opportunities to emerge and what are some of the things that we should be tracking, I guess similar to the way we're trying to track the acceptance in places like India, etcetera; what kind of things you would be looking at in B2B to look for that potential acceleration? Thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "On cross-border, just a couple of things to point out; that is in fact an improvement in the rate of January and we think that will sustain based on everything we're seeing. One item that is affecting our reported numbers is the shift in Europe, included in our cross-border numbers as it is for others too is intra-European cross-border volume that is cross-border business within the EU. That's different than typical cross-border volume but does get included in the cross-border volume and you do have people moving -- acquiring within Europe, and so when fairly large account decides to acquire in the UK from a non-UK location, it's a sizeable move in the reported numbers with modest revenue impacts. So if you add that back, I mean the real underlying growth rate was quite a bit higher than the reported growth rate.", "In terms of trends that help that, as we've said before, one of the best things that can happen to our cross-border business in some respects of the weaker dollar, we have a large U.S. acquired business. The good news is we did see the growth rate in that business step-up but it was from very low levels; so our U.S. acquired business which is a very attractive business is growing faster than it was and will most likely continue to grow faster but it's still growing less than the overall growth rate of the cross-border business. So there is one variable that could accelerate cross-border growth further would be the U.S. acquired business, growing faster and going back to double-digit levels like it has been in the past.", "Beyond that we'll have to watch what happens as European currency strengthened, clearly it will help the acquiring business in Europe as this becomes more attractive for people or rather the issuing business coming out of Europe as it becomes more attractive for Europeans to travel out. So those are couple of trends that can -- that are both watching.", "Alfred Kelly", "And James on the question about B2B; it really is a large opportunity, we are focused on it, we have a senior person and a team focused on B2B, we think that through the use of Visa Direct we can meet the needs of a lot of the small and medium sized merchants and using things like single use virtual cards in larger verticals like healthcare and travel. That said you raised a good question around how we can give you guys a bit more insight to our progress and let me take that away and maybe the next quarter or some point later this year we'll try to give a little bit more insight in terms of things to watch there and how you can evaluate the progress we're making along the way.", "Operator", "Next question will be from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Jason Kupferberg", "I think you mentioned out that during holiday season in the U.S. ecomm was about 30% of volume. Can you give us some broader ecomm metrics globally -- what percentage of global volume, how fast is it growing? And then, I'm just curious to get your quick take on the contactless initiatives in the U.S.; what's the issuer response so far because it sounds like that would create some new expense for them? So I just wanted to get your perspective there. Thanks.", "Alfred Kelly", "On the first question, I don't think we're prepared to start giving breakdown on country by country basis on ecommerce versus card -- present type of growth. I think it developed countries that the trends that I talked about in the U.S. are similar in some of the developed countries. Obviously, in less developed countries the mix and the dynamics between the two and different. In terms of contactless, I think in the United States, again -- the pluming is in place to go, we think by the end of the year 50% of the terminals in the U.S. will be contactless enabled on terminal -- virtually every terminal being shipped now is contactless enabled. And I think the U.S. issuers are getting excited about the prospects of the customer experience associated with contactless and I would expect that you're not going to see a massive off-cycle replacement of with NFC -- that are NFC enabled. But I think that you will start to see issuers as they go through their normal card renewal cycles and there is the replaced cards that are lost or stolen, etcetera, that more of those will be replaced with cards that are NFC enabled.", "So I think this is a multi-year journey but -- again, there will be an inflection point at some point where it will really take off as we reach a certain level of scale and clearly, we're not there yet but I think we're poised to begin the journey.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Keane", "I just wanted to ask about the operating margins; they were down I think one point year-over-year and looks about one point short of where street was estimating. So just want to think about personnel and G&A costs which were up a lot, does that continue throughout the year and how much did you take advantage of just lower tax reform in the quarter to maybe crank up the expenses which caused a little bit lower margin? And then just a follow-up on Visa Europe; the technology migration going on, will that have a positive benefit to margins in fiscal year '19 as a result of that and just trying to figure out about how much? Thanks.", "Vasant Prabhu", "On the expense side, you might recall when we talked to you last quarter about outlook we had indicated that you should expect expense growth to be higher in the first half than the second half; a lot of it has to do with year-over-year comparisons. Personnel expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year for a variety of reasons, I won't go into all of them, some will have to do with the consultation process that was under Europe, some had to do with the fact that we had also done the global restructuring coming into the quarter. So personnel expenses were off to a fairly slow start and if you looked at our personal expenses last year they climbed through the year; so this rate of growth in personal expenses you should not see continue beyond the first half. So there are year-over-year comparisons.", "On the G&A side, as I said there were some non-recurring items and some shifts and expenses that make that number higher than it normally would have been. So we did have a number of expenses in the quarter that were of a non-recurring or timing variety but our original outlook for expenses remains unchanged versus what we told you. We have deliberately chosen to reinvest an additional 2 points in expenses as a result of tax reform. I wouldn't say a lot of that was in this quarter, it was more what we expected based on comparisons plus some of these non-recurring and timing related things.", "Alfred Kelly", "On the second question Bryan, I think we have to see how -- we haven't even begun the migration, as I said we're beginning next quarter. I think we're going to have to see how long it takes, we're going to be measured in deliberate and careful about it. We'll get some benefit from it financially once we're all the way there but I think in terms of timing it's a little bit too early to say and I think in terms of mentioning it, I'm not actually sure we have mentioned it; it's all part of having this transaction continue to be accretive at a level above what we thought it would be when we made the acquisition in the first place.", "Joon Huh", "And with that, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today.
