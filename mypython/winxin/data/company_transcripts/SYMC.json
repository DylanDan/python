(NASDAQ:SYMC) Q1 2018 Earnings Call August  2, 2017  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Nate Pollack - Symantec Corp.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Analysts", "Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (NYSE:USA), Inc.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Ian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2018 Fiscal Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. I'd now like to turn it over to the Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Nate Pollack. Mr. Pollack, you may begin.", "Nate Pollack - Symantec Corp.", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings results. We posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations Events webpage.", "Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec CEO; and Nick Noviello, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks for revenue. During the call, we may speak to a growth adjusted for acquisitions metric, which includes prior period non-GAAP revenue from acquisitions adjusted for Symantec's accounting policies including quarterization. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses excludes the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas' deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations. As a result implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred revenue on the balance sheet will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below.", "Our operating management uses those non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and annualizing future periods. We believe those non-GAAP non-financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and to our peers and that investors benefit from understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.", "And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark. Go ahead, Greg.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you for joining us, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to share that both our business segments exceeded their Q1 revenue outlook and have strong underlying growth drivers with attractive profitability. We continue to accelerate our leadership in the Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety businesses, as evidenced by customer success, technological innovation and our financial results.", "We are on track to achieve our full-year financial outlook and confident of the momentum building in our second half pipeline. At the same time, today we also announced DigiCert's acquisition of our Website Security and related PKI assets. Later in my remarks, I will share a summary of the transaction, impact to customers and impact to Symantec.", "Firstly, I'd like to touch on the dynamic threat environment and how Symantec continues to protect our customers. As many of you are aware, there were two major malware outbreaks in the past quarter, WannaCry and Petya. Both are stark reminders of why the world needs Symantec more than ever. These attacks spread quickly, infecting many high-profile companies globally and rendering data on victims' computers unusable.", "Symantec's advanced endpoint security capabilities proactively protected against both WannaCry and Petya. Neither attack had virtually any impact on our customers. While some other security companies failed to protect their customers, Symantec's software has, to date, blocked more than 1 billion attempted WannaCry attacks. This is a testament to our significant presence on Enterprise and Consumer endpoints, as well as the effectiveness of our advanced technologies.", "We are committed to protecting customers against all forms of cyber attack across all attack surfaces and continue to evolve our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform and Consumer Digital Safety offerings to fulfill that mission. In this regard, I'm pleased to report that innovation is thriving across Symantec. We're now regularly applauded by customers for being on the forefront of innovation based upon what we have developed internally, as well as what we have acquired and integrated. We're accelerating our leadership through both organic and inorganic development.", "On the organic front, we've implemented releases on the endpoints that are coming soon. By the end of the calendar year, we're releasing the next version of SEP, SEP 14.1, which is a significant new release of our flagship Symantec Endpoint Protection product line and builds upon the highly successful launch of SEP 14 last November. It includes some key innovations that we believe will improve our overall security posture for customers, including actionable intelligence on suspicious files in a customer's environment and aggressive tunable protection that can be adjusted for individual users or groups. In addition, SEP 14.1 is designed to be highly effective even in sites with low connectivity, as it relies heavily on advanced machine learning and other signature-less technologies and does not need frequent content updates. We are seeing good early traction with customers in our beta release.", "In addition, by the end of the calendar year, we'll also be launching ATP 3.0, the next major release of our EDR solution, which adds Flight Data Recorder capability, recording all activity on the airplane. This will provide valuable contextual endpoint data to incident responders, increasing productivity and delivering cost savings, as well as close one of the remaining gaps in a hyper-converged endpoint.", "These new product releases further increase the value of our endpoint solution versus traditional antivirus providers and other point providers. On the consumer side, we've now delivered the first shipments of Norton Core, which was built from the ground up by our own consumer team and has received wide recognition. Norton Core is another great example of the innovation that's taking place at Symantec.", "Core is a secure Wi-Fi router that helps protect home networks from malware using network packet inspection, provides high speeds using an omni-directional antenna, and offers advanced parental controls. All of this is controlled from an easy-to-use mobile app. Pre-orders have exceeded our expectations, and Core is now available at norton.com, as well as other premier retail outlets, including Best Buy and Amazon.com.", "On the inorganic side, we recently announced two important acquisitions, Fireglass and Skycure, that will bring significant innovation to our portfolio and allow us to introduce new methods to stop attacks. Both transactions closed last week and will leverage our existing sales motion to bring value to customers.", "First, let me review Fireglass. Fireglass is a leading provider in the fast-growing Threat Isolation security category. The technology reduces the attack surface and decreases False Positive alerts in the security operations center, saving customers time and money. The Fireglass solution represents a significant leap forward in the CISO's ability to keep users safe even when they're visiting risky or uncategorized sites.", "Fireglass provides a secure execution environment for users, whether they are on the web or on e-mail. Dangerous links and attachments pose no threat to the user as all code is run remotely in isolation and never reaches user's endpoint.", "In discussions with customers at the Black Hat Conference this week, Fireglass technology was seen as a direct extension of our current proxy environment. We believe that it will act as a natural boost to our existing sales motion, particularly as part of the refresh cycle for our ProxySG franchise.", "Now, let's discuss Skycure. With this acquisition, Symantec will be the only large endpoint vendor to provide customers with comprehensive Mobile Threat Defense across iOS, Android and Windows operating systems, as well as enable a new approach to BYOD for enterprises and consumers.", "Skycure's predictive technology uses a layered approach that leverages crowd-sourced threat intelligence, in addition to both device and server-based analysis, to proactively protect mobile devices from malware, network threats and app and OS vulnerability exploits with or without an Internet connection.", "Existing mobile tools, like Mobile Device Management or Enterprise Mobility Management, do not protect mobile devices and are not able to defend closed operating systems from attacks like Skycure can. We believe mobile security is going to be paramount for our customers and a massive opportunity for our endpoint franchise.", "Symantec will now provide a comprehensive endpoint security portfolio for traditional devices like laptops, desktops and servers, as well as mobile devices. This is a key differentiator against traditional endpoint and emerging endpoint security vendors who do not protect mobile platforms. We will be in a unique position to integrate mobile with network and our cloud security portfolio to enhance our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform for our customer base.", "For our Consumer business, we expect Skycure to accelerate traction for our mobile offerings with major telcos who are seeking partners for improving security. Closed operating systems are an attractive opportunity for improving cyber defense. Skycure brings defense in depth to closed operating systems, which is important for iOS and Windows 10 S and differentiates us from competitive offerings.", "Importantly, both Fireglass and Skycure integrate easily on our core franchise. From an innovations perspective, we have been actively tracking the Threat Isolation and Mobile Threat space for over a year which led to these leaders.", "From a go-to-market perspective, Fireglass and Skycure bring add-on offerings to existing sales motions, and we're targeting the same buyer. We received very vocal support from major customers and industry analysts on these acquisitions. And they demonstrate our commitment to remain at the forefront of innovation, benefiting our customers and our long-term revenue trajectory.", "We continue to invest significantly in our organic development capabilities, as well as pursuing new technology acquisitions, where prudent, to accelerate our cyber defense offerings.", "Now, let me transition to our Enterprise business. Here, our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is resonating with customers and driving increased pipeline. We are positioned as the clear leader for the cloud generation and are building more pipeline and winning more deals on superior technology and unmatched integration.", "Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is becoming a significant competitive differentiator for us. We are beating or displacing incumbent security vendors on a more frequent basis and seeing more success with the cross-selling of components within our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, as evidenced by larger deal sizes in the Enterprise and additional customer examples of per user security savings.", "Let me provide you an example of a customer that consolidated from multiple security vendors to Symantec. In the quarter, one of the largest financial technology companies purchased nearly our entire Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. The main driver here was our best-of-breed integration across the portfolio, which saved the customer millions of dollars per year, while also increasing administrative efficiency and simplicity by standardizing on Symantec, displacing four incumbent competitors and beating cloud security challengers hoping to win new business. This deal would not have taken place without the combination of Blue Coat and Symantec.", "During Q1, the individual components of our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform showed strong competitive momentum. Our CASB product line continued its growth momentum, winning many large Enterprise customers, either beating or displacing major competitors in the cloud arena. Some of the wins include a 40,000 seat deal at one of the country's largest retailers and a 30,000 seat deal at a mobile payment company.", "Let me share a final example of our integration and Integrated Cyber Defense Platform winning deals. During the quarter, one of the largest soft drink distributors was an existing Symantec DLP customer, but using a competitor for endpoint security. Our account team introduced SEP 14 and ATP to the customer, who was immediately impressed with our EDR capabilities in the integrated SEP ATP solution.", "This led to winning the endpoint business and displacing the incumbent endpoint competitor for 20,000 employees, another demonstration of the integration and the platform winning in the market.", "Now, as many of you know, through the integration of Symantec and Blue Coat, we also made significant improvements in our go-to-market programs and partner simplification. At the beginning of the quarter, we went live with our new combined Enterprise sales organization, substantial improvements to our partner model and simplification across the business.", "From external-facing collateral to internal systems, changes we made were substantial. I am proud of the work that was done and want to thank the team for executing and delivering strong results for customers and for Symantec. Now, the sales team is leveraging all the work as they execute on our strong and increasing pipeline.", "Now, I'd like to give an update regarding the recent developments related to our Website Security and related PKI solutions. As you may be aware, earlier this afternoon, we announced an agreement with DigiCert to acquire our Website Security and related PKI assets. DigiCert is a portfolio company of private equity firms, Thoma Bravo and TA Associates, and is a leading provider of scalable identity and encryption solutions for Enterprise web security.", "DigiCert is solely focused on providing leading SSL and PKI solutions. With this transaction, we believe DigiCert will have the resources needed to lead the next generation of global website security. We're excited about the prospects for the combined company and are deeply committed to its success.", "We will receive a minority ownership stake in DigiCert at the closing of the transaction, allowing Symantec to continue to participate in the value created by this transaction and ensure a successful transition for the customers of our Website Security and related PKI solutions.", "Nick will be sharing further financial details of the transaction in his remarks. This divestiture sharpens our Enterprise Security business focus on our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform strategy which, as I've highlighted throughout the call, is a top priority for us. It also positions us for achieving higher growth.", "As a result of the transaction, we are increasing our long-term outlook for Enterprise Security organic revenue growth to high-single to low-double digit compared to our previous outlook of mid to high-single digit organic revenue growth.", "You may be aware that we've been in ongoing discussions with Google and Mozilla regarding the shift to a SubCA business model in our Certificate Authority operations. As a reminder, under the SubCA business model, our SSL/TLS certificates would be issued through one or more independently operated third-party CAs until we develop and deploy a modernized PKI platform that is acceptable to trust stores.", "The DigiCert acquisition accelerates the transition for our customers to a new PKI platform at DigiCert that meets all industry standards and browser requirements, ensuring continuity for our customers and providing a foundation for continued innovation. During our discussion with the browsers, our goal has been to minimize the impact to our customers. And we believe this transaction achieves that goal and commitment.", "Moving to our Consumer segment. Consumer Digital Safety is an entirely new category that is resonating with customers. Consumer Digital Safety revenue exceeded guidance and grew 1%, adjusted for acquisitions. This is one quarter ahead of our plan. This improvement in growth was driven by number of factors across both Norton and LifeLock.", "From a demand perspective, we believe recent ransomware attacks drove improved activity across our Norton portfolio. Retention rates for Norton Security and LifeLock exceeded our expectations, and we continue to optimize consumer engagement across installed base.", "Our new Norton WiFi Privacy app has also continued to perform well globally. LifeLock has performed better than expected since our acquisition. Unaided brand awareness has grown to 40%, our highest in history and more than 5x our nearest competitor. And, to-date, we've exceeded our acquisition plan for consumer growth while simultaneously decreasing our customer acquisition costs.", "As you know, identity theft is not just an issue in the United States. We're actively working on expanding LifeLock internationally. We have plans to enter in the first international markets by the end of fiscal 2018 and expect to expand into additional countries in fiscal 2019. I'm also pleased to report that we've completed most major elements of integrating LifeLock ahead of schedule.", "We are encouraged by the initial acceptance of our efforts to create a new Digital Safety category and have received positive response from partners and consumer message testing. We expect to be actively selling LifeLock into our Norton customer base this quarter and offering Norton Security as a highly differentiated feature to all new LifeLock customers, which should result in higher ARPU, higher retention and lower cost of acquisition.", "In summary, I'm very pleased with the results from Q1 and the hard work from the team and feel great about the opportunity for the rest of the year. The pipeline is strong and we have solid momentum, which gives us confidence in our second half outlook. Profitability in the Enterprise segment has improved dramatically year-over-year.", "In just one year, Symantec has made a major transformation across both Enterprise, Security and Consumer Digital Safety. I want to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for being with us on this journey.", "It is evident that our strategy to combine best-of-breed technology with unmatched scale is working and believe will result in long-term market share gains. We expect both our Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety businesses to grow in the low to mid-single digits, adjusted for acquisitions this fiscal year.", "We're achieving this growth while substantially improving profitability in our Enterprise Security business and maintaining our market-leading margins in the Consumer business. We are now in full execution mode. This sets us up to be in position to realize the full benefits of our transformation in FY 2019. Our agreement to sell our Website Security business and related PKI assets to DigiCert allows us to dedicate more focus towards delivering unparalleled protection for the cloud generation.", "Let me turn the call over to Nick to go through the numbers.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter fiscal 2018 results, discuss several critical achievements we've now completed on our integration and transformation journey, update our fiscal second quarter and fiscal year 2018 outlook, and update our medium-term outlook from Financial Analyst Day, reflecting our planned divestiture of our Website Security and related PKI assets. We have also made additional details available in our CFO commentary, which has been posted on our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated.", "Let me start with an overview of our Q1 financial results. Our first quarter revenue was $1.228 billion, exceeding the high end of our $1.185 billion to $1.215 billion guidance range, driven by outperformance across both our Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety segments. As the dollar depreciated during the quarter, currency tailwinds provided an $8 million benefit to revenue relative to our Q1 guidance.", "Total year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, adjusted for acquisitions, was down 1%, which was at the high end of our Q1 guidance of down 4% to down 1%. Operating margin for the first quarter was 31%, above our guided range of 27% to 29%, driven by top line outperformance and continued execution against our cost savings initiatives and synergies.", "We remain ahead of schedule to achieve our expected net cost efficiencies, as well as our expected Blue Coat and LifeLock cost synergies, which gives us further confidence around our guidance and the significant increase in operating margins we expect this year. As you may recall, we expect to achieve net cost efficiencies and Blue Coat and LifeLock cost synergies of $580 million in the aggregate by the end of fiscal year 2018. Currency tailwinds also provided a $5 million benefit to operating income compared to our Q1 guidance.", "Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.33, above our $0.28 to $0.32 guidance range. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased by 3 million shares to 664 million relative to our Q1 guidance of 667 million, partially due to impact from our convertible notes, driven by a lower share price. Please see the dilution tables posted to our Investor Relations website, where you can see the impact to diluted share count from the convertible notes at various stock prices. Finally, cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter was $251 million and CapEx was $47 million.", "Now, let's review our operating segment performance for Q1 in more detail. First, I'll review the performance of Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment revenue was $669 million and grew 41% year-over-year. Enterprise Security growth in constant currency, adjusted for acquisitions, was down 2%, at the high end of our Q1 guidance of down 5% to down 2%. As we discussed on our Q4 earnings call, our Website Security products comprise approximately $350 million of revenue in our Enterprise Security business.", "In Q1, revenue from our Website Security products was down 1%. Enterprise Security deferred revenue was $1.814 billion, excluding the impact from Veritas and adjusting for purchase accounting write-downs, compared to $1.824 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017. Further details are available in our CFO commentary. The amount of revenue that rolled off the balance sheet during the quarter was consistent with our expectation. Enterprise Security operating margin was 17%, up 11 points year-over-year, driven by our cost savings initiatives.", "Now turning to Consumer Digital Safety. Our Consumer Digital Safety segment revenue was $559 million and grew 40% year-over-year. Consumer Digital Safety grew 1% in constant currency, adjusted for acquisitions, at the high end of our Q1 guidance of down 1% to plus 1% growth. It is important to contrast that to just one year ago, Q1 of FY 2017, when Consumer Security revenue was down 8% in constant currency.", "Q1 FY 2018 Consumer Digital Safety operating margin was 47%, driven in part by top line growth and a faster realization of LifeLock synergies. Consumer Digital Safety deferred revenue was $1.042 billion, adjusting for purchase accounting write-downs, compared to $1.059 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017. The amount of revenue that rolled off the balance sheet during the quarter was also consistent with our expectations. With respect to this segment, over time, we do not expect deferred revenue to be the best metric to evaluate the business, as we anticipate a shift from annual to monthly billings with our bundled solutions. Further details on deferred revenue are available in our CFO commentary.", "As we outlined in our Financial Analyst Day, on a quarterly basis, we will provide direct subscribers, direct ARPU and partner revenue for our Consumer Digital Safety segment. We are presenting this on a going-forward basis to give color as to the significant metrics driving this segment. As this is a combination of statistics from businesses, Norton and LifeLock, that had different measurements historically, we will not be providing year-ago comparisons for these metrics. For Q1, direct customer count was 21.1 million at the end of the quarter. Direct ARPU was $7.87 per month. Recall that we expect these direct statistics to represent approximately 90% of the revenue stream at any one point in time. And, finally, partner revenue was $58 million. Further definitions of these metrics can be found in our CFO commentary.", "Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. During the quarter, we repaid $2 billion in debt, consistent with our deleveraging commentary from Financial Analyst Day. As of June 30, we had $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $6.3 billion in gross debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We completed our previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase during the first quarter and received 2.2 million shares. In total, we repurchased 16.4 million shares under the March 2017 ASR. We have $800 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization.", "As we mark the one-year anniversary of the Blue Coat acquisition, I would like to recap some of the important achievements and successes in integrating Blue Coat and Symantec. First, as we've discussed, from day one we started integrating products and, to-date, have completed over 12 major product integrations.", "We continue integrating additional Blue Coat and Symantec products with 10 more planned over the remainder of this fiscal year. These integrations have become a core driver of both customer wins and pipeline growth while creating, we believe, powerful competitive differentiation to uniquely solve customer problems that have otherwise been out of their reach.", "Second, we remain ahead of plan on our commitment for cost synergies. At the same time, we have eliminated an enormous amount of complexity in the business. We've streamlined our distribution and channel, simplified SKUs and pricing and worked hard to start to modernize back office systems, all of which has benefited customers and our own opportunity.", "And third, on April 1, we successfully achieved the goal of combining our two sales teams into a single organization. Despite all of the change, our sales team delivered and the systems and process changes were successful. We also rolled out our new secure One Channel program. Our distributors are now on standard contracts and have placed orders without challenges. This outcome is testament to our integration capabilities as a company and the hard work that our team took on.", "Now, as Greg indicated, earlier this afternoon we announced that we've signed a definitive agreement with DigiCert to acquire our Website Security and related PKI assets. We expect the transaction to close after the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, and therefore expect Website Security to be reported as part of discontinued operations by the time we report earnings in November.", "At that time, we expect to update our fiscal 2018 guidance to include the impact of the divestiture on our results. You should also expect that we will reconcile our Q2 results between our outlook today and the continuing and discontinued operations we will report as a result of the transaction.", "Today, I will first provide an outlook for fiscal year 2018 and Q2 excluding the impact of the divestiture; and, second, provide you with a framework to understand the associated impact of the divestiture on our future results.", "With respect to the outlook, while we are pleased with our Q1 outperformance and are even more confident now in our going-forward pipeline and execution plans, we are maintaining our fiscal year 2018 outlook on a constant currency basis given the substantial transformation and execution still underway.", "On a nominal basis, including favorability from foreign currency, we expect fiscal 2018 revenue at guided rates to increase to approximately $5.160 billion to $5.260 billion, from $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion previously. We expect approximately 3% constant currency revenue growth, adjusted for acquisitions, at the midpoint.", "For fiscal year 2018, we continue to expect Enterprise Security growth, adjusted for acquisitions, of 3% to 5%; and Consumer Digital Safety growth, adjusted for acquisitions, of 1% to 3%. We continue to expect operating margins for fiscal year 2018 of 36% to 37%.", "We expect our earnings per share will benefit, on a nominal basis, from favorable foreign currency by approximately $0.04. As a result, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS at guided rates to increase to approximately $1.79 to $1.89, from $1.75 to $1. 85 previously.", "We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 29. 5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 675 million. We have not built substantial share repurchases into our share count estimates, as our focus from a capital allocation perspective in fiscal year 2018 is on debt reduction.", "From a cash flow from operations standpoint, we are maintaining our previous guidance provided at our Investor Day of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This incorporated approximately $500 million of restructuring and transition payments and approximately $600 million of stock-based compensation expense. More than half of that stock-based compensation expense is related to acquisitions, including Blue Coat, where lockup restrictions have now been met. We expect this level of stock-based compensation expense will decline over time.", "Moving to our second quarter outlook, which also does not include the impact of the divestiture. We expect revenue to be up 25% to 28% in constant currency which at guided rates, including favorability from foreign currency, translates to $1.260 billion to $1.290 billion.", "We expect Enterprise revenues to increase 15% to 18% which implies growth, adjusted for acquisitions, of approximately 1% at the midpoint. We expect Consumer Digital Safety revenue to increase 40% to 42% which implies growth, adjusted for acquisitions, of flat to up 1%.", "We expect total company operating margin of 34% to 36%. We expect EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, and an underlying share count of approximately 670 million. Our plan and guidance on each of these measures for the second quarter is consistent with the first half guidance we discussed at our Financial Analyst Day.", "Now, on to the potential financial impact from the announcement of the acquisition of our Website Security and related PKI products by DigiCert. We anticipate that the transaction will close during the fiscal third quarter following satisfaction of customary closing conditions. At that time, we expect to receive approximately $950 million in upfront cash proceeds and receive a 30% common stock ownership stake in DigiCert. We expect to account for our ownership stake under the equity method of investment.", "Let me provide a brief background on our Website Security and related PKI products. As many of you may recall, we acquired the Website Security business from Verisign in 2010. Subsequently, in 2012, we purchased the remaining interest in Verisign Japan. Though included in our Enterprise Security segment, our Website Security and related PKI solutions are not marketed or sold as part of our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform.", "Moving to the financial impact from the divestiture. When we report our second quarter earnings in November, we expect Website Security will be reported as part of discontinued operations. At that time, we will update our fiscal 2018 guidance to exclude the impact of Website Security and related PKI assets.", "Today, for modeling purposes, I will provide a framework for the financial impact of the divestiture to our ongoing business. As a reminder, these solutions are within our Enterprise Security business segment.", "Together, and on a full-year basis, the Website Security and related PKI products are expected to contribute slightly over $400 million in revenue, approximately $350 million related to Website Security and approximately $50 million related to select PKI assets; and combined operating income of just over $180 million in fiscal 2018.", "Given the nature of carve-outs, after closing, we will continue to be burdened with stranded costs of just over $50 million on a full-year basis that were previously allocated to the Website Security and related PKI products, which will not be transferred to DigiCert. We expect the combined impact of the transaction, on a full-year basis, to our fiscal 2018 operating income would be a reduction of approximately $235 million, incorporating the combined operating income of the business and stranded costs.", "Assuming the divestiture and, again, on a full-year basis, we expect our pro forma acquisition adjusted total revenue growth for fiscal year 2018 would be approximately 0.5 point higher; and our Enterprise Security growth, acquisition adjusted, would be higher by approximately 1.5 points.", "We expect our operating margin in fiscal 2018 would be approximately 150 basis points lower than our previous guidance of 36% to 37%. And we would expect the Enterprise Security operating margin percentage, excluding the Website Security and related PKI products, to be in the low-20s compared to our current outlook of the high-20s.", "Again, excluding Website Security and related PKI products for the entirety of the fiscal year, we would expect EPS to be approximately $0.20 lower in fiscal 2018 relative to our original guidance, assuming relatively constant weighted average share count.", "Finally, we would expect fiscal 2018 cash flow, from a run rate perspective, to be approximately $200 million lower than our current guidance. When completed, we expect one-time cash taxes, fees and expenses of approximately $350 million in the aggregate, resulting from the transaction with DigiCert, although that estimate is subject to change. We expect the transaction proceeds, net of expected taxes and expenses will be primarily used to repay debt.", "Now, let me talk longer term with respect to the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 perspective we gave at our Financial Analyst Day. For fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, we continue to expect total organic revenue growth to be mid to high-single digits. However, post divestiture, we expect to get to high-single digit total company organic revenue growth faster than we originally expected. For this longer term outlook, we now expect Enterprise Security organic revenue growth of high-single to low-double digits, up from mid to high-single digits previously.", "In fiscal 2019 and 2020, we continue to expect total company operating margin percentage in the high-30s and now expect Enterprise Security operating margins in the high-20s. And we continue to expect low teens EPS growth as we provided at our Financial Analyst Day. Once closed, we will update and confirm all of these impacts for you.", "In summary, in Q1, we outperformed our revenue guidance across both Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety, and we are optimistic about our sales pipelines which gives us confidence in our second half outlook.", "Within one year from the closing of the Blue Coat acquisition, we've made significant progress integrating Blue Coat and Symantec products, eliminated an enormous amount of complexity in the business, successfully combined two sales teams and rolled out our new Channel program.", "Even with all these changes, we remain ahead of plan on our cost savings and synergy initiatives, which gives us confidence in our guidance and the significant ramp up in operating margins we expect this year. Our guidance for the fiscal second quarter is consistent with the first half guidance we provided at the Financial Analyst Day.", "With respect to our 2018 outlook, we've updated our fiscal year 2018 guidance to reflect the favorable foreign currency benefit. But we are maintaining our constant currency guidance given the execution that is still to come in the second half of the fiscal year. As I discussed, the decision to divest our Website Security and related PKI assets is expected to provide us with greater focus and an improved top line growth trajectory.", "To conclude, we transformed our business in fiscal year 2017, and this fiscal year is about execution. The execution taking place now will set us up for great opportunity in fiscal 2019 and beyond to achieve mid to high-single digit organic revenue growth, which we expect will come faster as a result of the divestment of our Website Security and related PKI assets and to deliver industry-leading margins from our operational improvements, resulting in low teens earnings growth and strong cash generation to drive shareholder value.", "Thank you. And let me transition the call to Nate for Q&A.", "Nate Pollack - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you. Operator, we're ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We would now like to open up for questions and answers. In the interest of time, so that we may attempt to get everyone's questions, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie.", "Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter, Greg and Nick. A couple questions for you. I would love to get some clarity on the rationale behind the sale of DigiCert's business? And what that 30% stake is going to enable you to do and how that's going to impact the Enterprise segment, if at all, going forward? And, Nick, you mentioned using the proceeds of the sale to delever the balance sheet. Is that sort of the entirety of the proceed usage? And then, a follow-up for Greg. I'd love to know how the subscription adoption of web proxies is progressing within Blue Coat as well?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Sarah. So let me start with some of the rationale, and then I'll pass over some of the financial numbers to Nick. So as many of you have followed in the news, the SubCA and Website Security SSL/TLS certificate business has been ongoing. And we feel that this area needs a very focused and dedicated team on it and we think that DigiCert is the right partner for that.", "As you all may be aware, we were looking through all of the Certificate Authority partners to find the best partner to execute a model where certificates could be minted outside of Symantec also. And DigiCert definitely differentiated themselves in that space, for the global nature of our business, and also I think it's a very well run, excellent business.", "So we feel that this part of the industry needs an extremely focused management team. And we also are very pro-consumer here at Symantec, and this also removes some uncertainty for our customers and gives a path forward for Website Security. I think this industry needs some investment, and DigiCert is very well set up, especially when combined with Symantec Website Security, to really lead that investment and really drive the state of the industry forward, especially around things like certificate management lifecycle, things like that.", "So we feel that this a great move for our customers. It's also something that allows us to focus on what our Enterprise core business is which, as we discussed in our prepared remarks, is our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. And we think that, all in all, this is a great outcome for long-term Symantec growth and also for the certificate cap industry and also a great outcome for our customers. So with that, I'll pass over to Nick to hit a couple of those financial questions. Go ahead, Nick.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Hi, Sarah. Let me sum up a couple of pieces for you and a little bit is in the script, but let me walk through it. So on the Enterprise side of the fence, keep in mind, if I look forward to 2019, FY 2018 we have to close the transaction. We've given you a perspective of a full-year basis for FY 2018, but I think it's better for you to look forward to 2019. And if I think about the Enterprise business in 2019, we think this benefits the growth outlook for Enterprise in 2019. So when we talked before about our medium term outlook at our Financial Analyst Day of Enterprise Security revenue of mid to high-single digit growth, that gets benefited. So it's actually a little higher than that. So it's high-single to low-double digit in terms of organic revenue growth for the Enterprise group.", "On the profitability side, it impacts it a bit the other way because we won't be over 30% in terms of margins, but we'll certainly be in the high 20s. That's a combination of the business itself, which we walked through the profitability of it, as well as those stranded costs. And the stranded costs are really around, as we support the transition services of the agreement and try to do our best to transition the business to DigiCert and help them get it ramped up and going. So we just need to be thoughtful about that. I think, importantly, on those stranded costs, those will fall off over time; and again, that's a $50 million number that will fall off over time.", "In terms of the overall transaction, the equity, we feel good about this business being managed by the experts at DigiCert. And that equity interest is \u2013 they're running the business, so that is equity interest for us and that will show up in other income going forward. We've not put that into any models or thought about that in terms of any models at this point in time. We'll update you once we close and get past those pieces.", "And then, finally, you asked about proceeds. And certainly this is a business where once we get to close and once we get through determining evaluations and tax liability, et cetera, there will be a set of net cash proceeds and a split of that between domestic and international. And you should expect that the U.S. proceeds, we'll be able to use pretty quickly for debt reduction. And then, on the international side, we have to just work through on our ongoing structures there. But that hopefully sums it up for you.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "And, Sarah, just one more comment. DigiCert is very experienced at migrating large web PKIs. So in their history, they have a substantial experience of doing that and we think that that's going to be extremely good for our customers. And I think that's really big shout-out on the call that we think that this is going to land things in a great spot for that very important Enterprise customer and other folks in the (47:13).", "So moving on to your next question about subscription and Blue Coat. I think one of the things that we are very excited about in the quarter, which was in our prepared remarks, we have had some very nice network cloud success. What we've done in Integrated Cyber Defense is we've put a big effort into integrating our Web Security cloud with our Cloud Access Broker, with our Data Protection technology.", "So if you're a customer and you're wanting to go all cloud for your sort of Web Security needs, we have that covered. If you have any compliance issues, data compliance issues, that's in the stack through our DLP integration. And then, if you need any multifactor authentication to reduce risk there, that's in the stack. That's all integrated. We had an outstanding quarter in displacing our competitors in that space and winning just net new business. We feel really good about that.", "From a booking to revenue situation, over the last year and a half, if you think about what that number was like in Blue Coat prior to the Symantec integration a year and a half ago, that number is a lot more to the balance sheet, which is really the effect of selling a lot more cloud in the Blue Coat mix.", "Operator", "Okay. And our next question is from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the solid set of results. Also, thank you for the added color and transparency on the Consumer on some of the ARPU numbers. Greg, I want to start with bird's-eye view type of question. So I know you mentioned bits and pieces of that during your prepared remarks, but WannaCry hit the tape on May 14, Petya took place during the final week of June. Can you share with us whether you've seen that as a headwind or a tailwind? I think, clearly, in your case, it appears to be a little bit of a tailwind.", "And secondly, Symantec has a sizable European exposure, yet you showed the solid performance in that region unlike many other security players this quarter specifically. How do you see yourself different from some of the other players within that European arena? Thank you for that.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes. Let me start with sort of the malware crisis that we had in the quarter. WannaCry, Petya, they were serious things. One of the things that happened here at Symantec was our customers were protected from both of those malware plagues. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that as of a few days ago, we had blocked over 1 billion attempted infections from that EternalBlue vulnerability and WannaCry.", "We were out in front of that one. We had coverage in all kinds of pieces of that technology. And that really helped us because some of our competitors didn't fare well in that crisis. We were a good operator for the industry. We shared our information through, I think, what is a very solid alliance that we have the other network security players and other security players through Cyber Threat Alliance and helped the world kind of get around that.", "I think the fact that WannaCry and Petya didn't get our customers was really a testament to the innovation and R&D that we have put into in our product set over the last few years. SEP 14 was a solid release. It definitely carried a lot of water on that. And also, our threat labs were all over that. You might have seen us on the news really early in that attack. We knew a lot about it and we shared that with all the various enforcement agencies and whatnot.", "So I think we fared well there. What happened there is, we did definitely saw an uptick in pipeline from some of the very major accounts that were affected by that malware; and that has given us a solid lift in our Enterprise pipeline. Those things are displacements of existing competitors. They take a little while to get tested and deployed. We do hope to see some better outlook in future quarters from what happened there. So that was quite good.", "Now, moving to Symantec Europe. We're definitely not seeing the same as many others had reported around issues in Europe in our business. I think what's happening there is we have our Integrated Cyber Defense offering. So we're in accounts. We've taken some share. We've got a very powerful story for kind of the higher end of the market, and that is something that is carrying the water for us.", "And then, I think also in the middle market, our effectiveness around some of this malware was great. And so, if you think about that, we have a very powerful opportunity just mining in the installed base, which is really helping us out as we're bringing a differentiated value proposition to point vendors.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you, guys, for taking the questions. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the sales force reorg. It was a pretty significant change that you made in the overall organization. Can you kind of give us sort of a mark-to-market on where are we in terms of implementing those changes? I guess, the overall question, are we out of the woods in terms of feeling comfortable that there's not going to be any further disruption in that business?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes. So, Keith, thanks for that question. That's a good one. So we did enter, the beginning of Q1, with a completely aligned sales force. And summary is, it worked, as you can see in the results. And that was where had truly \u2013 if you think about it as a capacity at sort of the named account layer, we have had two people in the same account. We started April with having realigned that entire sales force to a few accounts each. And so, that give us a massive capacity expansion in the (53:17) of the market.", "As you know, from the Financial Analyst Day and other remarks, we had put more emphasis on the back half of FY 2018. We expect that capacity to come into play later in the year and then into FY 2018 and 2019. In addition to that, we integrated a bunch of information systems that we manage the sales force with that went live in the quarter. They held up. And so, we do think that we are underway in a good place on that sales force alignment.", "We have some more to go in terms of systems and integration and making sure we've got all the pieces right. So I want to give us a health check that that transformation is in a good place. Just a little bit to go in the next couple quarters. And so, we're keeping a real close eye on it.", "The other thing I'd just like to mention is attrition is extremely low in our sales force, which is always a test of whether or not our folks think we're set up for success in the future. So that was a big change. We were definitely very focused on it as a management team and a sales execution team in Enterprise, and we've got through it pretty well.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it, and maybe one follow-up for Nick. The $0.20 number you gave for potential EPS impact in FY 2018 from a full year view, just so we're clear, is that just sort of the impact from the operating income that's going to come out of the equation? Or does that also include the potential sort of benefit from sort of the other income? Does it have anything in there for debt repurchases on that side of your ledger?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Yes. Good question, Keith. So what we're trying to do for FY 2018 is give you the perspective full-year basis of the business. So the $350 million of the business we talked about in Website Security plus the related TKI assets gets you to the $400 million level. It's the operating income associated with that. It is also a set of the stranded costs.", "There are some puts and takes otherwise for 2018, but we really have to get to close, which is why I was really pointing at FY 2019 on the business side of the fence. We will expect that there is a result from the JV side of the fence that will show up in other income, though us talking about or guiding to any of that at this point in time is a little premature. So we want to wait until we get to closure and get past close, where we will update with certainty the FY 2018 guidance for you and then be able to roll through those things for FY 2019 for you as well.", "But the big chunks here are, you've got the business itself. And I walked through the operating income associated with the business, the $400 million issued business, and then the stranded costs which are a good $50 million in stranded costs. And the stranded costs, once we get to FY 2019 and we mostly get out of the transition services arrangements and some of those could go longer. That's when we'll be able to really be thoughtful about going after those stranded costs, which will be beneficial to the EPS side.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Greg on the M&A strategy from here. Could you elaborate a little on the process to select Skycure and Fireglass and some of the key inputs that went into your discussion on valuation?", "And going forward, what are the areas where you think you can still build up the technology? And is there is also a scenario where you would consider divesting other pieces of the portfolio that may not be core to that cloud security umbrella?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So I think, yeah, we are super excited about both Fireglass and Skycure. And these things they stand on their own. Every piece of M&A we do has got a certain case. It's our individual sort of details. So we really like the Fireglass acquisition, because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it allows us to isolate potentially risky stuff that's coming from e-mail consumption and also coming from consumption of the web.", "What that means is, your endpoint is no longer running at risky stuff, its running isolated off in the network somewhere, but the user doesn't really know that that's happening. So it looks like exactly the same user experience without exposing that endpoint to a lot of the risks of that kind of content consumption from the Internet. That is something that is right alongside our endpoint franchise and also our network franchise from the ProxySG franchise, and we can quickly ramp that into the market. And so, we were extremely excited about that.", "Results at the (58:21) of the security operations center is we're hearing from customers that have been doing this kind of thing, numbers that are a reduction in SOC events that are in very high numbers can't be ignored. And we have run this past a large number of our customers and they're very excited about it.", "Moving to Skycure, Skycure brings technology to the table that we've been looking for in our consumer and in our SEP franchise. It brings us, in the iOS context, on the Apple phones and iPads and whatnot from, I would say, not number one in the industry, to definitely being right up the top of the industry around effectiveness on iOS and mobile.", "But even more importantly, Skycure brings a technology approach to malware detection that also works in closed operating systems. And we believe that future will be almost 100% mobile in a few years and that many of the operating systems will become closed like Windows 10 S and iOS, and making sure that we can bring a defense and depth back into the customer base there.", "Those two acquisitions really play straight into the franchises we've got. Same SEs can sell it, same buyers can buy it, and it's really a really great adjacency for us. And we really like that kind of tuck-in acquisition because we know we've got the sales force and the channel to drive it, and we look for real value really moving the needle at the customer. And so, we think those two are great.", "In terms of divesting other assets in the business, we announced the DigiCert acquisition of the Website Security business. We are always looking at the portfolio making sure we got it lined up right for the future growth of this new benefit to our shareholders. At this point, we don't have any other plans to do anything, and also we're not on any kind of M&A quota. If we find something, we always got our eyes open, okay?", "Operator", "And our next...", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "I think we have time for one more question. Then we've got to run. Go ahead.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Nice quarter, guys. So I just want to ask a question on the Consumer segment. So Consumer revenue exceeded the high end of your guidance. I know LifeLock was above expectations. But can you give us any more color on the growth rates or demand trends you saw for both Norton and LifeLock in Q1? And then, I have a follow-up.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes. Nick, do you want to take that one or \u2013 you go ahead, yeah.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Okay. I think the first thing I'll say is \u2013 and we tried to make sure it was in the script \u2013 we're seeing a big difference from a business that's growing 1% in the first quarter this year from one a year ago that was shrinking 8%. So that's, number one, something we feel really good about. And the teams on the Consumer side deserve a lot of credit for making a lot of progress. We saw benefit on both the Norton side and LifeLock side.", "We're bringing together a set of things now and we're rolling out those Digital Safety bundles. We're rolling out Norton Core. There's a lot of positive energy. I think what you also saw is on the operating margin side some recognition of synergies early, which we also feel good about. So all in all, a very different picture than a year ago. Integration is, I would say, almost ahead of schedule in places. So that's good as well.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "And I also just would like to comment on the integration. I think that the shot in the arm that Symantec gets from an organization like LifeLock that bring a lot of talent, a lot of passion to the business, that's huge shout out for those guys in the company that are really making a difference and our Norton team. Norton performed extremely well. That WannaCry and Petya outbreak, our Norton customers were protected from that. I think that that part of the business is absolutely on the front foot morale-wise making a difference. And we are very confident that that acquisition of LifeLock is going to do very well.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "That's great. And then I think you mentioned that you're going to start cross-selling the LifeLock product this quarter into the Norton installed base. Do you intend on adjusting the pricing of the bundled products and what's your estimate for the number of Norton customers you think you can cross-sell that LifeLock into?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "We think that that percentage of people that are potential to purchase a combined bundle, we'll call it Digital Safety concepts, are very high. Pricing on each of the different cohorts and the different packaged bundles is a pretty detailed discussion. There's a lot going on there, and we have an excellent set of folks that are working through that and we run a lot of surveys and test. But we are bringing out combined bundles this quarter, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, and we look forward to that being well accepted.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So with that, I think we need to end the call, folks. Really appreciate your support. Thanks for listening to us today.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon. And thank you for joining our call to discuss our third quarter 2014 results. With me today are Steve Bennett, Symantec\u2019s President and CEO; and Don Rath, Vice President and Interim CFO.", "In a moment, I will turn the call over to Steve to review our quarterly results and provide a strategic overview. Then, Don will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance assumptions. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.", "Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec\u2019s Investor Relations website. A copy of the press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our site. Our prepared remarks will be available on the IR site after the call is completed.", "I\u2019d like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as reported basis only. We use our published foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency growth rates.", "Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, earnings per share, amortization of acquisition related intangibles and stock-based compensation, for the coming quarter contain forward looking statements.", "These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company\u2019s most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC and assumes that Symantec will have no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements.", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and in the supplemental packet.", "And now, I\u2019d like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett.", "Steve Bennett", "Thanks, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that total business activity, which includes new business and renewals, improved in the third quarter across all geographies and business segments as the critical changes we made last quarter to our sales organization began to take hold.", "As we told you in October, these changes created short-term business challenges. They were necessary, however, to build a foundation for sustained profitable growth. As our sales force focuses on gaining traction and building momentum, we expect it will take several quarters for us to build our deferred revenue balance and see positive year-over-year business activity.", "Given the significant changes we are making at the company to position us for long-term success, I\u2019m pleased with our financial performance this quarter. We expanded operating margin by 370 basis points and grew non-GAAP EPS by 13% year-over-year as lower spending and increased organizational efficiency offset the decline in revenue.", "It\u2019s been a year since we announced our strategy to transform Symantec to get the company on the right path for sustained long-term organic growth. To drive value for our customers and partners, our strategy is focused on three pillars.", "Offerings, leverage all of the company\u2019s technology assets, plus partner and acquire to deliver innovative offerings that solve important customer problems better than anyone else.", "Go-to-market, redesign our channel strategy and build our capabilities to improve sales and marketing effectiveness and efficiency.", "And third, work smart, improve execution by strengthening our processes and infrastructure so we are easier to do business with, execute with more consistency and are more efficient.", "To remain competitive in a fast changing market, we knew Symantec needed to fundamentally change. During the first half of 2013, we focused on planning and preparing for that change. We created the offering strategy, completely redesigned our go-to-market plans and functionalized and simplified the organization structure.", "For the last two quarters, we\u2019ve been focused on execution, implementing these changes. In July, we made the following changes to our sales organization, split the sales organization into renewals and new business teams, changed the roles of our direct sales force to focus on new business only with a specialization in selling either information management or information security and we launched our centrally managed renewals team, which is focused on adding value by extending the customer relationship and making it easier to renew and do business with us.", "These were critical changes that altered the coverage model for more than 90% of our direct sales force. Now that the structure of our sales organization is in place, we are laser focused on the critical levers that drive new business and renewals.", "We continue to make progress redesigning our channel program. In November we unveiled our new Global Channel Strategy and feedback from our most valued partners has been positive.", "The strategy is built on different kinds of partner competency and designed to recognize and reward the value our channel partners deliver to customers. Partners will be rewarded for making investments that build skills that support the delivery of comprehensive solutions and improve customer satisfaction.", "It will substantially improve channel execution by helping us build deeper more meaningful partner relationships. We will share more details of the new partner program, what it looks like, how it is different and what it means for our partners at our EMEA Partner Engage event in Budapest in February.", "We also recognized that the way people, businesses and governments secure and manage information also needs to change. Customers need our help removing the complexity inherent in securing and managing their information.", "Customers need unified security that is multi-tier, multi-layered, integrated, automated and delivered as a service. And a new concept we have termed Information Fabric to help them effectively protect, manage and derive value from their information regardless of where it is stored, plus have control and visibility over all their data across private, public and hybrid clouds so they can better manage policy compliance -- policy and compliance.", "In the past we focused on winning with a strong portfolio of individual point solutions and growth was dependent primarily on acquisition. We never really integrated the technologies in a way that added value for our customers, so organic growth was not a priority. That\u2019s changing with our new strategy.", "We will continue to invest in our leading point solutions. They are foundational, while at the same time delivering new and higher value added offerings that solve important customer problems better than anyone else. With our new strategy, we are executing against all three legs of the build, buy and partner spectrum.", "On the buy front, we plan to announce several small acquisitions over the next couple of quarters that will help us accelerate the progress of our strategy. We are focused on acquiring technology and engineering teams that accelerate our progress in delivering innovative new solutions that win in the marketplace.", "Core growth will become -- will come from integration and homegrown innovation. This is clearly our #1 growth priority. And these strategic tuck-ins will be slightly dilutive to our financial results in fiscal 2015. More on that as we get into the next fiscal year.", "On the partnership front -- offering partnership front, we are working to create ecosystems help the industry deliver both Unified Security and Information Fabric to solve these larger customer problems. It takes an ecosystem and an integrated, holistic approach because no company can do this on its own.", "We recently announced a partnership with Cisco to integrate technology into their Application Centric Infrastructure or ACI architecture. This partnership helps us extend our leadership into the infrastructure automation space while enabling us to dramatically accelerate our vision of unified security.", "We continue to work with several customers to integrate next-generation firewalls with Symantec Endpoint Protection using our Managed Security Service. This initiative is an industry first and will provide a new set of enhanced advanced threat detection capabilities that will enable our customers to automatically prioritize and provide comprehensive contextual intelligence for incidents based on correlation between network-based advanced threat detection, endpoint security, and Symantec\u2019s Global Intelligence Network.", "We\u2019ve delivered several important point products as we continue to execute on upgrading our leadership offerings. Storage Foundation 6.1 was released in December. It includes a disruptive new capability that abstracts in-server memory, allowing the sharing of flash storage across servers without the need for expensive storage hardware.", "We offer the only vendor agnostic solution providing these benefits so customers can run any storage configuration while managing performance and redundancy entirely through software. NetBackup 7.6 was released last week, which is centered on market-leading VMware support that empowers customers to protect the largest, most complicated environments.", "As IT organizations move to software-defined data centers, they can now simplify and automate the protection of massive and complex physical, virtual and cloud environments, which are the building blocks of a modern data center. NetBackup 7.6 is the only backup product designed for enterprise level scale, which can accommodate hundreds of thousands of virtual machines and petabytes of data while giving customers 400x faster recovery.", "We are also making solid progress on bringing our new integrated solutions to market. We launched Mobile App Center 4.3 this month, an important enhancement to our integrated mobile workforce productivity solution released last February.", "Central to this release is the Symantec Sealed program, which delivers enterprise-class security and control for both internal and third party apps on both iOS and Android operating systems. This functionality, coupled with our existing Enterprise Mobility Management capabilities and the recent release of another one of our integrated solutions, Norton Zone, enables our mobile customers to secure and access their corporate data anytime, anywhere on any device.", "Our strategy is the same but some of the specific offerings we announced have changed as we\u2019ve learned more and our thinking has evolved. For example, last January we announced Integrated Backup as one of our 10 new integrated offerings. However, as part of our ongoing product design, we determined to incorporate Integrated Backup into the NetBackup product roadmap. So we won\u2019t launch that as a standalone offering.", "With regards to a couple of the other new offerings announced, Internet Security Service and Information Fabric, we think these are larger, more comprehensive and more powerful concepts that combine our point offerings, our integrated offerings plus partnerships to change the way security is delivered and information is managed in the future.", "Customers and partners are a critical part of the process. Feedback from key customers and partners on our multi-year roadmaps has been very positive. We also plan to share publicly a more comprehensive product strategy with customers and partners at our Vision event in early May and with investors at our Analyst event in late May.", "As I look back over the past 12 months, we are exactly where I expected to be at this stage of our three to five year transformation. We are executing against our long-term vision and making short-term progress as expected.", "We said FY\u201814 would be a transition year and I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. We plan to grow earnings per share by mid-single digits and deliver more than 100 basis points in operating margin expansion for the year despite the difficult changes we\u2019ve undergone.", "We are still focused on our 5 and 30 objectives in the FY\u201815 to FY\u201817 time frame. However, to drive organic revenue growth, we need to invest in our offerings and other growth enablers in FY\u201815. We will continue to identify and eliminate redundancies and hidden factories to drive improved efficiency and better resource allocation across the company.", "We still need to dig our way out of the deferred revenue hole we dug this year which will impact revenue in FY\u201815. We expect further operating margin expansion to come in the fiscal \u201816 and \u201817 as we focus on rebuilding our business activity and positioning ourselves to win in the future.", "And with that, thanks for your support and let me turn it over to Don to provide a review of our financial results and guidance.", "Don Rath", "Thank you Steve and good afternoon. We\u2019re pleased with the financial results delivered in the December quarter, given the substantial changes our company is undergoing. In the December quarter, organic revenue declined 4.5% year-over-year and revenue declined 4% to $1.7 billion driven by the significant changes implemented in our sales organization.", "Both total business activity and license revenue improved this quarter compared to the September quarter. License revenue declined 27% year over year while content, maintenance and subscription revenue was flat.", "In aggregate, 88% of total revenue was ratable. Our total subscription revenue grew 1% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue compared to 42% of revenue in the year ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which excludes Norton revenue, grew 2% and accounted for 14% of total revenue in line with the prior year.", "Turning now to our business segments, our User Productivity & Protection segment declined 4% to $718 million. Flattish performance in our endpoint businesses was offset by continued weakness in endpoint management. GAAP operating margin for this segment was 37%, up 6 percentage points year-over-year due to lower sales and marketing spend.", "The Information Security segment declined 1% to $327 million. Continued growth in our authentication and DLP businesses were offset by weakness in our mail, web and data center security businesses.", "GAAP operating margin for this segment was 20%, compared to 8% in the year ago period, driven primarily by lower sales and marketing expenses. The Information Management segment declined 7% to $660 million. Continued growth in our NetBackup Appliances was offset by weakness in our BackupExec and information availability offerings. GAAP operating margin for this segment was down two percentage points, year-over-year to 27%, due to growth in our appliance businesses and lower sales and marketing spend.", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 20 basis points year-over-year to 84.5%, due to continued growth in our appliance and hosted businesses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.1%, up 370 basis points year-over-year due to organization simplification benefits, lower sales and marketing spend and slower than expected hiring.", "Non-GAAP net income of $358 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51, up 13% year-over-year as reported, driven by benefits from our organization simplification initiative, reduced spending and slower hiring. Deferred revenue was $3.6 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by lower business activity as we rebuild our new business and renewal streams.", "We exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $3.9 billion. Approximately, 42% of our cash resides onshore. In the December quarter, we returned $229 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.", "On December 18th, we paid a $0.15 per share dividend for a total of $104 million. We also spent $125 million to repurchase 5 million shares at an average share price of $23.76. Symantec has $783 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan.", "Cash flow from operating activities for the December quarter totaled $329 million, down 29% year-over-year, driven by severance payments and the impact of lower business activity on collections.", "Now, I\u2019d like to review guidance. For the March quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.615 billion to $1.655 billion compared to $1.748 billion in the year ago period. Approximately, 73%, or $1.2 billion of our March quarter revenue is estimated to come from our balance sheet.", "We expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 18.0% to 19.5%, compared to 14.6% in the year ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 24.5% to 26.0%, compared to 24.1% last year.", "GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.29 and $0.31 as compared to $0.27 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.40 and $0.42 as compared to $0.44 in the year ago period.", "Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro and an effective tax rate of 28% for the March quarter. We expect common stock equivalents for the quarter of 702 million shares.", "As part of our enhanced capital allocation strategy, we will issue a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. Payment will occur on March 19th to shareholders of record as of February 24th. In addition to paying dividends, we will also continue to buyback our shares.", "Our fiscal year 2014 results will be higher than the guidance we provided last quarter due to better than expected third quarter results. We expect fiscal \u201814 revenue to be in the range of $6.666 billion to $6.706 billion, compared to $6.906 billion in the year ago period.", "We expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 17.6% to 17.9%, compared to 16.0% in the year ago period.

Travis, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. (Operator Instructions)", "Helyn Corcos", "While the Operator is polling for questions, I\u2019d like to update you on our upcoming conference events. We will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 3rd in San Francisco, and we will be reporting our fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results on April 30th. For a complete schedule of our investor events and materials, please visit the events section of the IR website.", "Travis, we are ready for our first question.", "Operator", "And our first question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup", "Hi Stephen, I wonder if you could talk a bit about -- it looks like your larger deals, actually the deals over $1 million were flat year-over-year, which most of your other metrics here are showing a decline year-over-year as you move through this transition. I'm wondering if that's at all leading indicator of what you're seeing and maybe just update us on in general where you think you are with the sales force transition and what we should look for going forward in terms of signs of improvement further?", "Steve Bennett", "Thanks, Walter. I think that the deals flow in and out during the quarter. When you look at it statistically, there's not a lot of variation that I see. But I think where we are as we said when we made these changes that it takes two to three quarters for people in new territories to build the momentum. And I think we saw the progress. We said that we expected Q2 to be the floor. We expected Q3 to be better. And we expect Q4 to be better.", "The pipeline looks pretty good. I think in using kind of the terminology language you guys use in implied billings, we were down 9% in Q3 and our current guidance makes us down 5% in Q4. So, I think we continue the trend. There's not a lot of new news other than I feel like we are stable and we are now in operating mode and there's not a lot of restructuring to happen. We don\u2019t expect any changes to [kind of the] [ph] field really as we go forward in FY \u201915. So now it\u2019s just, can we put the points on the board?", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup", "And then just related to acquisitions and further spending, it does sound like you are upticking your plan to some degree there around what your OpEx plans are for 2015. Can you just talk through at a high level what the puts and takes are to 2015? It does feel like there are probably still some expenses to come out of the organization and then also it sounds look you're adding some investment back in. ", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah. I think we are still in the middle of really working through all the details. It\u2019s an interesting thing. We are trying to balance three things. I talked to the Board about - I talked to the team about, we have to invest in the things that are going to help us drive long-term growth, number one.", "Number two, we have to continue to work to get out inefficiencies and redundancies in our company and because of decentralized fragmented nature and really the operational opportunity is quite large here and the question is, how do you change the tires while the car is moving on some of those things and change the way we do to work.", "And then third, the third element is obviously margin expansion, so that we continue to make progress, align with our 5 and 30 targets. So we are right in the middle of going through that right now as we plan for the future and we\u2019ve got some tough decisions to make to try and find the sweet spot between all three of those elements.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JP Morgan.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan", "Thank you. Steve, it\u2019s nice to see you hit the numbers. You are actually exceeding a lot of your numbers this quarter. But license was still down meaningfully, down 27%, I realize you are going through a transition here? But has there been a change in any of your previous license model businesses of late sort of moving towards a subscription like sort of the backup and recovery are more people starting to consume that willing to buy a subscription or are there still licenses and is what we are seeing just something that we should expect to get better as time goes on as your transition, your business transition progress?", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah. No. I think we\u2019ve had really no, I think, this is a real number. I think other than a slight mix shift where enterprise subscription revenue grow to 14% a total, there's been no catalyst that are trying to force people to move from A to B, so I think the pretty much the 27% is kind of what our team delivered in the quarter, there is no unusual efforts on that.", "But as we go forward, I think, ultimately, we expect the mix shift the subscriptions to continue in Symantec like we've seen, but I think that\u2019s the performance on creating new business activity and that's part of the opportunity we have as we go forward.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan", "Okay. Great. And if I might follow up, you talked about information fabric and unified security. And both those strategies are going to require and you talked about it either work closely with a lot of your partners. I guess can you talk a little bit of more about what\u2019s happening internally? Is there a head of partners like somebody that's trying to organize this that reports to you?", "And then maybe talk a little bit other than the Cisco partnership you mentioned and I -- Symantec had some level of partnership with Cisco for a while. What's been happening there, especially with maybe the network security vendors, who you don\u2019t really compete with but somewhat complementary?", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah. No. I -- we hired a very strong woman, Roxane Divol, who was a McKinsey partner for 16 years and she joined our team in I think September. She runs the partner and alliance program for us. She\u2019s a direct report to me and partnerships, offering partnerships become an integrated, a very important part of the strategy as you talked about John. And so we're pleased that she joined the team and we\u2019re really starting to get some traction there.", "And look, I think, it's safe to say that these two unified security and information fabric are concepts that solve a big customer problem and their multi-year outcome. So we are going to continued to deliver lots of our point solutions and our integrated offerings and partnerships with respect to changing the way information is managed and security is delivered.", "With respect to network security partnerships, we've got now, I think, with one of the leading next-generation firewall companies, we\u2019ve got five customers that are running this pilot we describe and we\u2019re working on the announcement timing on that whether there will be at Vision or RSA or their user conference.", "And so, look, I think, we want to get enough learning to do that, it\u2019s taken us sometimes longer than I thought, but it\u2019s clearly the right thing and the feedback is really exciting and I think it's going to connect the endpoint and the network in a way that we think will be better than what other people are able to do.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan", "Great. Thank you, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.", "Greg Dunham - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have done a good job of improving operating margins, especially in the user productivity segment despite the decline in growth there. How much of that improvement has been due to lower OEM fees and can we expect that type of margins going forward? Thanks.", "Steve Bennett", "I think Greg, part of it is due to your lower user OEM fees. And so I think that will be a one-time event that factors in through the year, as opposed to all at once based on the revenue. But I think that will be a one-year special costs change that will lift margins.", "I think longer term and we\u2019re working a lot of interesting things in that business to integrate the technology stacks where we had four redundant stacks between Altiris, Symantec end point protection, Norton and our mobile teams. And so we\u2019re working on some interesting things that are going to be more platform nature to do it once and serve all of the mobile devices that our customers want to manage, not just mobility or SAP or Norton, or Altiris. And so those things, we are making progress on that.", "And so I think over time we have an opportunity to be more efficient in our engineering spend in that business as we eliminate all the silos that were all playing their own game in the past. And so one-time event on the margin improvement from OEM fees, a big margin improvement opportunity on eliminating redundant technology and doing a better job for customers that will come out too over the longer period.", "Greg Dunham - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS", "Steve, if you could give us just an update on innovation pipeline on some of these new products. I know there is lot of question. And also how you think about the addressable market for mobile APT and cloud apps, you get a lot of questions around that. Thanks.", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah, Brent. We\u2019re actually going to go through interesting tomorrow with our employees, kind of the roadmap for the next four quarters. So a combination of all the key releases for our existing kind of point offerings and also all knew what we call 4.0, new integrated offerings and it\u2019s actually quite an interesting list.", "So I think that will be the foundational elements that we share with and vision at our Investor Day in May. So stay tuned for more details on that but we\u2019re busy beavers working really hard to execute that we launched the mobile workforce productivity or the app center that I mentioned, that\u2019s getting really good reviews. So we have a lot of good stuff coming.", "You know it takes a while. I wish we could go faster. We\u2019re working on that. But it was only a year ago that we announced the strategy and then changed the whole structure. So I think you\u2019ll start us to pick up traction as we know are in operating and remote move forward. And a lot of the focus now working on is to integrate what we do with others to provide and in a way what we do with ourselves to provide leading advanced threat protection.", "We believe we have as much or more capability. Anybody else, we just had it dispersed in a bunch of different products and we haven\u2019t marketed particularly effectively. So big focus on mobile, a big focus on APT and we think we are making progress. Now the world is moving faster we go to pick up our pace. But the feedback we get is from a lot of customers, if you can build what you\u2019re saying, we want to buy it. So we\u2019re moving as fast as we can.", "Brent Thill - UBS", "Just a follow-up on that Steve, I think you articulated that. You have laid out some pretty thoughtful roadmaps that customers can see. And I guess the question is given those roadmaps perhaps maybe they didn\u2019t see that in the past for Symantec. Are you seeing some of the customer step-up with orders now realizing that there\u2019s more to come and they are willing to commit on other products with the willingness to commit down the road?", "Steve Bennett ", "We\u2019re seeing that, exactly we\u2019re seeing that on our mobile offer where people likely architecture in the path we\u2019re going and so yes on mobility. On the other things, I think its safer to say that we are -- this customers are telling us, we are describing a solution in bold unified security and information fabric that resonates with them. And they want to be lighthouse customers to be part of helping us shape for the development and how evolves. So we have a lot of work to do and now to build and stitch the components together to deliver it on that concept for our customers including the partnerships that the John referred to.", "So I think the answer is on something just we\u2019re getting people to buy into the multiyear roadmap and architecture and others the best we\u2019re able to do is get people that are on the earlier stages to want to be lighthouse customers. And so I think that's probably the most accurate description I could give you at this point.", "Brent Thill - UBS", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies", "Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Steve, you talked a little bit about, I guess, I\u2019m some seeing some stability in the business coming through Q2 which indicated with sub more disruptive quarter. I guess the question I have is you described a lot of product coming out here. You've also talked about partnerships and integrated offerings.", "Given the change in the sales model in sort of holding the bar higher for your sales organization, how do you the keep the focus to make sure they move in product that\u2019s important to your P&L and not get diluted maybe enjoying go to market with partners and sort to get lost in that way, that seemingly is always a little bit more difficult for companies in sort of enjoying go to market model.", "Steve Bennett", "Aaron, you must have sat in our staff meeting yesterday because we talked exactly about what you talked about is we actually went through. The economic leverages and the models for both our Symantec business and our Norton business to make sure the top 25 people in the company all understand with very clear, with a high degree of clarity the levers and how decisions we make on renewals in new business and what we discount, what we don't discount, contribute to our financial roadmap.", "And so we\u2019re going to go through the same data with our top 150 people in the company next week. And I think, you are over the target of something that I guess is a huge opportunity for our company which is to really focus our resources on selling deals and transactions and customer relationships that we make money on as opposed to treating a dollar is a dollar. And there is a big change for us to move from bookings to selling the stuff that creates lifetime customer value.", "And we talked about this in great detail tomorrow and we\u2019re going to as I say talk about it next week. So we\u2019re going to be much more focused with the right metrics and execution on the commercial side. Our team is very excited about this. It\u2019s a big change from history and it will take us a while to make it all happen but there's a lot of low hanging fruit for us. In my opinion in this area from better management leadership and a more strategic view of decisions and how they impact the financial levers?", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies", "Okay. And then quick follow-up if I could. On the M&A comments, I know you said these are small and really just for tactical deals. But if there any sort of worth a way you can given in areas that you're looking at or the field that already agreed on in principle, or can you just guide any color on to that. Thanks.", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah, I would say, and how it might be nervous but I think all four will be add up to less than $200 million. So that\u2019s the size. At various stages in all of these, they are all directly correlative to information fabric or a unified security and building out our capabilities and the integrated offerings that are part of that. And so, I think, when we make these, it will be readily apparent the logic for the transactions.", "And as I said we\u2019re buying engineers and technology to help us go faster as opposed to buying revenue. And so we\u2019re quite excited about that and we think it's just another focus of playing offense to move faster. Complement our organic growth focused not to in lieu of and so it\u2019s the organic growth focus is number one and these will help us accelerate progress. And so stay tuned, we should have some -- we\u2019re getting a little fore shadowing on that. We\u2019ll have details detail as to come as we go forward but in total they all add up to less than $200 million.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies", "All right. Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays", "Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats from my sight. Quick one, Steve, you\u2019re now kind of a good few months into the sales force. Can you help me in kind of understanding a little bit better how things are going especially when renewal team, how they kind of setting out. And how is it for the established sales guy to start selling kind of a newer product side. In the past, we had commented on renewals and so it\u2019s a big cultural change for them. How is that progressing from your perspective? Thank you.", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah Raimo, I think this is why it takes a while. And it is really a big change to separate renewals from new business and take people that had been paid on our blend but primarily renewals to all this since. So okay you going to be paid only under business. And then plus we have to stand up the renewals team as a separate entity. And so I think we\u2019re going through the learning curve. Is anytime you go to do something so significant you have learned a lot of things and you see things that you have to adjust and adapt to.", "I think we\u2019re gaining attraction. There still more we have to do on both fronts which is why it takes a while for this kind of massive change to take hold. I think what\u2019s happening is we're getting better everyday and stabilizing. I think the new offerings start to calm, the new channel strategy starts to have some more positive impact.", "And it looks as why we're pleased with the quarter but we\u2019re not happy, I\u2019m not going to be happy until we get new business activity and revenue is growing. But it\u2019s my judgment that we had to go through this massive change of basically everything we do from offering to go to market to marketing and sales to win in the future.", "And so I'm actually quite pleased that we\u2019re absorbing all this and delivering what I consider to be a pretty good year given all the challenges. But everyday we\u2019re getting better and I don't see any big disruptive things coming, it just how fast can we suggest and learn and adapt and give these new offerings and markets, so that we can get some more sizzle in the market. We\u2019ve been starting to make progress but we lost a little bit of ground in the transition which is understandable.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays", "Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie", "Thank you very much for taking my question and it's good to see your performance improved from last quarter. My question, Steve, is around Norton, is it fair to assume that Norton bookings were flattish year-on-year, given the comment for overall endpoint protection? And also hoping you can comment on the status of your relationship with HP which I think came up for renewal pretty recently? Thanks.", "Steve Bennett", "Yeah. I think, Brad, all of the endpoint business, I think, as Don said in his script was relatively flat. And I think, we\u2019re going to see some pressure on our new user acquisition based on how some of the OEM agreements have sorted out. I think the opportunity for us is to take a lot of money that we were investing in that channel and acquire customers directly and build a digital first marketing direct capability.", "And so, I think, we had invested a lot of money in the Norton business and channels where our lifetime customer value was not what we would really like. And there are other channels we had underinvested in where the lifetime customer value was very strong.", "So this is again something we talked about in great detail yesterday at our staff and I think, we need to move faster, are in the process of moving faster to channels that are where we can create more profitable lifetime customer value and this is a big transition is going on.", "We're also launching for the first time, Norton branded small business solutions, which we, I think, will be an interesting pilot to try and extend and expand the Norton offering, because I think for small businesses under 25 or 30 in all market, I know a little bit about from my Intuit days, we think Norton is more powerful brand than Symantec and we think that could be a nice life extension.", "So we\u2019re working on all of the levers to, I would call it life extended Norton business. At the same time, I would tell you, I think, it\u2019s -- we have to solve a new customer problem to get that to be a growth business and be accretive to the 5 and 30 plan and that's something that we\u2019re working hard on doing. So that's really an update from my perspective of Norton.", "And as we\u2019ve talked about, we think, we can deliver increase cash flow in the Norton business for quite a few years based on costs and redundant technology and exiting deals that weren\u2019t financially attractive to us. The question is, can we find the new customer problem to for Norton that will help us get back on the growth trajectory and we\u2019re working on that. If we can\u2019t get -- if we can\u2019t we have lots of other growth opportunities that we think can create real value for shareholders, so probably more on that in the May session.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie", "Thank you. Just one quick follow-up, Steve. I know you are not going to guide, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve guided to deferred revenue this quarter, but as we model out billings typically in the past, sequentially we would see them up from Q3 to Q4, is the any reason we shouldn't expect that this year as well?", "Steve Bennett", "I think that, I guess, I would answer, I\u2019ll see Helyn wants to answer that one or Don. I think, look, I think the implied billings and you heard us talk about this now for the first time, I actually think the way the street measures this is a good way to measure it. Putting revenue change with deferred revenue are up or minus and we are actually thinking more about running our company the same way you have measured us. So we are still trying to figure out what that means because I actually think the way the street keeps score here makes sense for us to be thinking about the same way and that\u2019s a big change for how we used to think about it.", "And so, I'm answering your question in a more philosophical fashion. And so, I think, we are trying to figure out what that means going forward. So at this quarter let me leave it for that.", "I think the big thought is we did when we -- when bookings went down so far in the second quarter and even in third quarter where they are down year-over-year we have created a bit of a differed revenue whole but we have to dig out of next year as we look at kind a revenue -- our revenue plan for next year.", "I mean that's really the answer to your question and there some pressure for us now on growth in FY 15 based on our new business performance and are deferred revenue slide this year, I think down 5% year-over-year, but remember the number right.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks again for taking my questions, Steve.", "Helyn Corcos", "We can follow-up on that too, Brad, with regards to the actual differed revenue. We would expect it to be up sequentially, probably around $3.8 billion is probably around like ballpark to be thinking about.", "Don Rath", "Yeah. I think you can refer that from guidance.", "Helyn Corcos", "From the guidance page, yes.", "Steve Bennett", "Thank you, folks.", "Helyn Corcos", "Yeah.", "Steve Bennett", "Okay.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "Steve Bennett", "Thanks Brad.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "Hi. Thanks guys. I was just looking at results and one of the things that kind of jumped out versus consensus expectations was that information management line. I know you guys have some struggles there with the Backup Exec release about a year ago. Where do you think you stand there, what do you see in that market especially from a pricing perspective but also just where you guys stand with your products right now? Thanks?", "Steve Bennett", "Well, I think we are clear leader in the Backup, especially as managing information in this more complicated large corporate data centers gets more on more challenging. But I think with respect to be -- I think we don\u2019t have our head above water yet. We have a new release coming midyear, mid calendar year. We think it\u2019s going to add some real nice features, fix the UI and actually become compatible with what Microsoft R2 release if I remember right.", "So, I think we have been a little bit slow on platforms support and I think that\u2019s something we are addressing to change our development process to be a faster cycle on platforms support and separate that from kind of our big more annual or 15 months releases. And so I think there's a bunch of stuff we need to do. Backup Exec though is one of the pressure points. Altiris is the other pressure point in information management. So we are doing well on some fronts like appliances and NetBackup appliances, but those are the two products that are putting a little pressure on us over the -- in the short-term.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "Got it. Thank guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James.", "Helyn Corcos", "Mike, are you on the line because we are waiting to hear from, Mike? Do we want to move on to the next question and then if Mike is available, he can draw back in.", "Steve Bennett", "Or he is on mute. Let\u2019s go to the next question, Travis.", "Operator", "Certainly. Our next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley", "Excellent. Thank you very much for taking my question. And, Steve, very much appreciate all the transparency you\u2019ve given us into this transition on call, really unprecedented and certainly helping us cover so a great deal of detail, I appreciate that. The question is about certain operating margins and operating margin commentary about FY\u201815.", "It\u2019s furnished for those correct and what you are trying to get across that more than operating margin needs to take place in FY\u201916, FY\u201917th. It seems like part of that actually come from the acquisitions. But they seem relatively small, was your acquiring. Is there an element of reinvesting thing going on, and where are those key areas of reinvestment that you guys think -- if that\u2019s correct you guys think you need in FY\u201915.", "Steve Bennett", "No, I think that's exactly right, Keith. Look, this is an industry where you have got to have leadership products to win. And there is a big change for us to invest in our own ideas, which we are pretty excited about. And so balancing the investments, we need to make to win in the marketplace with how long it takes us to get some of the efficiencies out of our inefficient structure and redundancy. And so as I said, we are just in the middle of the planning process for that and we are going to know a lot more about that.", "I guess it\u2019s safe to say, I wouldn\u2019t expect the same kind of margin expansion in FY\u201916 or \u201915 that you are going to see this year from us because we are investing and growing. We are in this for the long-term and we believe that we are on the right path. And as we get these new offerings and we get their go-to market properly aligned, we feel comfortable and we are confident we\u2019re on track for the five and 30.", "But we have a lot of execution to do between now and then. So we don't have any other details, including how many of these deals get done and what their impact is. So stay tuned, we'll have a lot more for that when we combine guidance. I guess, we are giving you a little foreshadowing to not to expect the same kind of -- don\u2019t just model what happened this year that might not be accurate as we think about going into FY\u201915.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. If I could just sneak in one follow-up, in terms of the sales hiring -- the overall hiring this quarter being slower than expected, was that purposeful or was that a plan that you slowdown the pace of hiring or was it just -- it's a difficult hiring environment and a lot of competition for engineers and sales guys that you guys weren\u2019t able to hire up to plan.", "Steve Bennett", "I think our eyes were bigger than our stomach. I think we wanted to hire. We did not shut down any thing. So we are still investing. We just could not bring on -- now we have high standards, so we are just not trying to hire to fill bodies. We wanted to hire great people. We are not able to bring in as really great people in multiple areas that are going to drive grow and I think that\u2019s -- I think I will say our eyes are bigger. If somebody wanted to hire, we didn\u2019t shutdown hiring. It\u2019s just -- we are going to compromise our standards and it is just taken longer in some cases to bring the talent on board. And so we will factor that into our thinking as we go forward in our hiring plans for FY -- the fourth quarter and FY\u201915.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley", "Excellent. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Bennett, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Steve Bennett", "Well, thanks to everybody. I think the thing I would say in summary at 10,000 feet is I think the quarter turned out pretty much the way we planned that we wanted to show progress. We did a little better than we thought. I was pleased about that. The pipeline looks pretty good. So, I'm cautiously optimistic about the fourth quarter and the momentum we have going into FY\u201915. At the same time, we over delivered because we under spend mostly on hiring.", "And so I think that is something that we are pleased with the short-term results, but until we get into positive new business activity or positive revenue growth, we won't be happy. And so rest assured, we are paddling as fast as we can to take cost and redundancy out, invest in things that are going to make us easier to do business with and drive growth and balancing growth with investments, cost reduction and margin expansion as we go into our thinking for FY\u201915. So, thanks for your support and hopefully, our discussion here give some insight for all of you on how we are thinking about things today and maybe going forward a little bit. Talk to you next quarter. Bye.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Miss Helyn Corcos. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss fiscal first quarter 2011 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website at www.symantec.com /invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For June 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.26 per euro and the end-of-period rate was also $1.26 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro.  For the June 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.40 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information.", "As a reminder, we will provide a currency update following the end of each quarter. This will be posted on our website's quarterly results section. Given the rapidly fluctuating exchange environment, we encourage everyone to apply our rules of thumb as a guide to estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics once the quarter has ended.", "Moving on. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website.", "And now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique Salem", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start off by highlighting our key priorities for fiscal 2011. These priorities are: extending beyond the PC in consumer security, growing license sales, expanding the adoption of our SaaS offerings and simplifying the customer and partner experience. While we made progress in some of these areas during the June quarter, a number of enterprise deals slipped due to a longer than expected customer procurement cycles driven by continued cautiousness among IT buyers. In particular, this affected our Storage Management results. With that said, we are confident that these deals have not been lost to competitors, as in fact, we have closed many of them in July.", "Having said that, highlights for the quarter included strong results in our Public Sector business and continued strength in DLP and SaaS. In addition, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our new backup solutions and are pleased with the steady growth in the Consumer business. The integration of PGP and GuardianEdge is off to a great start with customers excited with the addition of new encryption offerings to our portfolio.", "We\u2019re pleased with the year-over-year growth in public sector deals for state, local and federal governments. We signed a multi-year contract with the U.S. Marine Corps who chose to use NetBackup with their Enterprise IT Services program. In addition, SESCAM, a Public Health Care Department in Spain, signed a multi-year contract spanning across our Endpoint Security, backup storage and service offerings.", "Our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge is resonating well within the government sector due to the adoption of standards-based solutions and increased regulatory encryption requirements. This positions us well for the federal government fiscal year and in September.", "In our Enterprise Security segment, we continue to do well in a large and mid-sized enterprise market segments. In particular, customers are adopting DLP, which generated another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Our DLP solution continues to shift the focus of security from simply locking down the infrastructure to protecting the information itself. As a result, we are leveraging our relationships with CISOs to sell our data protection suite along with our endpoint security, management and compliance suites. Customers are increasingly turning towards vendors that offer complete security solutions versus point product tools. Our suites enable customers to protect completely, manage easily and control automatically the assets most crucial to their business. We\u2019re seeing higher Net Promoter Scores as for our Enterprise Security suites driven by the recent improvement in customer experience and quality.", "We continue to address the SMB market by increasing our focus with our channel partners. For example, we have expanded our small business specialization partner program. More and more small business customers are increasingly adopting managed services to reduce upfront licensing costs and operational expenses. As a result, we expanded our service prior program, enabling our partners to offer customers a monthly subscription. This licensing model aligns with the way these partners do business with their customers.", "The Symantec Hosted Services business posted strong, double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by Hosted E-mail Security and newer products such as Web Security. In the last 12 months, we grow our customer base by 50% and we remain the clear leader in this fast growing market by gaining share from our competitors around the world. In May, we launched our internally developed Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection solution. The early response from our customers has been very positive do to its ease of use and lighter footprint on the endpoint. Our hosted Endpoint Protection solution was jointly developed leveraging the combined answer please enterprise, consumer and hosted services teams. We will continue to expand our portfolio by delivering additional hosted services such as Data Loss Prevention and archiving. I'm pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in this part of the business.", "Now moving on to our backup and archiving business. Backup Exec posted double-digit bookings growth of year-over-year across all geographies. Backup Exec 2010 has been one of our strongest backup releases to date. There\u2019s been more than 155,000 installations since its February release. Small and medium-sized organizations are excited about our simplify data management from integrated deduplication and archiving as well as virtual machine protection. We will continue to educate and engage our partners on the new features and benefits of the product.", "Since the launch of NetBackup 7, we have seen more than 2,350 installations and over 12,000 customers are evaluating the product, representing approximately of 25% of the NetBackup install base. Customers value the improved storage efficiency with integrated deduplication, greater infrastructure utilization and faster recovery times, which reduces the total cost of ownership. We expect this release to benefit us in the second half of this fiscal year.", "In the September quarter, we expect to ship a new version of our archiving product, Enterprise Vault 9.0. With this release, we plan to include support for Exchange and SharePoint 2010, enhance the deduplication and additional e-Discovery capabilities. These features will make it easier for our customers to adopt and standardized on our archiving solution.", "Our Consumer business generated another quarter of solid growth driven by our award-winning products, superior user experience and multi-channel strategy. We continue to enter into agreements that are beneficial to both Symantec and our partners. As we announced in June, we are pleased to have extended our worldwide consumer security relationship with HP for another three years. This quarter, we expected our security OEM relationship with Toshiba to include Norton PC Checkup in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. Norton PC Checkup helps customer become aware of PC performance problems and recommends possible solutions. This is an opportunity to up-sell our Norton Security, backup and remote service offerings.", "Our PC Tools business achieved double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We are leveraging Symantec's extensive distribution network to distribute PC Tools worldwide. For example, PC Tools is now being sold in retail stores in France, Spain, Portugal and Hong Kong, taking shelf space from competitors. We also introduced PC Tools into the Japanese markets through a co-branded security solution with BBSS, a Softbank Group company, displacing our largest Japanese competitor.", "We completed the transition to our eCommerce platform in June as planned. The performance from our online store is surpassing our expectations. We can tailor the user experience depending on where the customer acquired our product to maximize customer spend and improve close rates. I'm very proud of the team's strong execution on this very strategic initiative.", "I'm pleased with the progress we've made since the close of the acquisitions of PGP and GuardianEdge in early June. Through the efforts of our integrated sales force, we exceeded our bookings expectations. The acquisitions generated revenues of $4 million and diluted EPS by $0.005, in line with our plans. Encryption is being sold by the combined sales force, and the integrated product roadmap is already complete. Customers and partners are responding well and I'm pleased with how we've executed so far.", "The acquisition of VeriSign\u2019s security businesses is on track to close shortly. I'm very excited about adding identity security to our portfolio as it strengthens our core value proposition in securing and managing information. By bringing together our security portfolios, we will be the only company capable to protect identities online and create hassle-free experiences for our consumer and enterprise customers. I look forward to updating you on this acquisition in subsequent quarters.", "In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy and vision of securing and managing information and identities. We are focused on delivering industry-leading products, integrated technologies and cross-selling the portfolio. I'm confident that we have laid the foundation for continued to improved execution in the September quarter. I'll now turn over the call to James to provide the financial details for the quarter.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, we saw strength in our Backup, Data Loss Prevention and public sectors sales. In addition, our Software-as-a-Service offerings posted double-digit growth. However, these positive developments were offset by the longer enterprise procurement cycles that Enrique referred to. Given the relatively high volume of our business that typically gets booked during the last week of a quarter, the additional time taken by some of our corporate customers impacted the June quarter's results. This buying dynamic was primarily a factor at some of our larger customers who typically buy products such as our storage management offerings.", "GAAP revenue was $1.43 billion and increased 2% in constant currency terms versus the June 2009 period. U.S. dollar strengthened 8% against the Euro as compared to the year-ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year.", "Net income was $284 million, resulting in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. The reversal of accrued interest related to the successful outcome in our Veritas 2000 to 2001 tax case added a one-time tax benefit of $0.01 to this quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share. Other one-time tax benefits recorded during the quarter generated another $0.005 of earnings per share benefit. Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $711 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year in each of our three geographies: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific/Japan.", "Now I'd like to move on to our GAAP revenue by segment. The Consumer business had another strong quarter generating revenue of $473 million, up 7% versus the June 2009 quarter. With the launch of our eCommerce solution, our renewal and upselling efforts continued to perform well. For example, our Norton 360 revenue grew 22% versus the reported results in a year-ago period and accounted for approximately 40% of total consumer revenue. Our Enterprise business generated a total of 245 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, down 6% year-over-year. 37 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 30% year-over-year. The lengthening procurement cycles that I mentioned earlier particularly affected the number of large deals closed this quarter.", "The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $524 million and declined 3%, as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We experienced fewer new license sales in our Storage Management business. However, our newly refreshed backup products performed well. Our mid-market product, Backup Exec, generated double-digit bookings growth as a result of the successful launch of the 2010 product. New releases of our enterprise-scale Net Backup product tend to be gradually adopted by data center managers over 12 to 18 months, although we are pleased with our early deployment results and with a positive customer reaction we've seen thus far.", "The Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $340 million, equivalent to an increase of 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both Data Loss Prevention and Hosted Services. The percentage of Symantec Hosted Services bookings driven by referrals from the on-premise sales force increased sharply year-over-year.", "Our Services business generated revenue of $96 million, an increase of 2% as compared to the June 2009 quarter. We have received positive feedback on our recently launched partner-led consulting program and we believe that our core software business will benefit from the resulting strengthening relationships with our partners.", "Turning now to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.9% for the June 2010 quarter, down 30 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased, as this line item now includes credit card fees driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers.", "Our non-GAAP operating margin of 26.5% in the June 2010 quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher consumer OEM fees. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $335 million. Cash flow was negatively affected year-over-year by higher OEM fees and cash taxes.", "We exited the June quarter with approximately $2.74 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we spent $362 million to acquire PGP and GuardianEdge. In addition, we spent $200 million to repurchase nearly 14 million shares at an average price of $14.49. We have $547 million remaining on our current board-authorized share repurchase plan. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of June 2010 was $3 billion, up 3% year-over-year.", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2010 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.26 per Euro for the September 2010 quarter versus the $1.44 per Euro that we experienced during the September 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 13% currency headwind. Also the end-of-period rate for the September 2009 quarter was $1.46 per Euro versus our $1.26 per Euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 14% currency headwind.", "Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 790 million shares and an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 28%. The acquisition of VeriSign's Identity and Authentication business is on track to close shortly. And therefore, we have already included approximately two months of revenue and contribution from the VeriSign assets in our guidance.", "Thus, for the September 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.465 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.47 billion during the September 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $10 million and VeriSign's security assets to contribute $16 million to our September quarter revenue. Once again, these acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.", "We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be down 1% to 2% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.09 and $0.10, as compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.27 and $0.28, as compared to $0.36 in the year-ago period. Our September quarter EPS guidance already includes $0.04 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we are expecting VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.03 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.01 in the September quarter.", "We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.83 billion and $2.86 billion, compared to $2.9 billion at the end of September 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be down 2% to 3% on an as reported basis and up 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. We expect approximately 70%, or $1.03 billion, of our September quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.", "In closing, we are very focused on quickly and successfully integrating our recently announced acquisitions while also executing on the growth opportunities inherent in our core business. We will continue to redirect our spending to areas with the best growth opportunities as we benefit from the various cost reduction initiatives that are driving additional efficiencies across the business. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator's polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We will be presenting at the Citi Conference on September 8. And we'll be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on October 27. For a complete list of our investor related events, please visit our events calendar on the IR website. Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll go first to John DiFucci with JP Morgan.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Enrique, can you comment a little bit more on the Storage business? It\u2019s not that there\u2019s a lot of expectation out of that business, at least from field checks. And from what you were saying, you're getting a lot of traction or at least interest in your new products, both Backup Exec and NetBackup. It's probably the most important products likely you've seen in many years. At the same time, we haven't seen a positive growth out of this business in quite some time.", "Enrique Salem", "Well, John, you did talk about NetBackup and Backup Exec. We do have great releases there, and they are continuing to get broad adoption. I mean, 25% of the base in NetBackup is looking at the product. And so we're optimistic about what we're seeing there. When you look at the core storage management business, what we're seeing is a move in our customer base to try to build out what I'll call a more distributed or scale-out data center, where they're moving to use many commodity components, commodity storage, and that's where the technologies like FileStore become more relevant. And so we\u2019re definitely seeing a move in the enterprise data center from what we\u2019ve traditionally seen as what I'll say the bigger focus on bigger systems to a more distributed architecture. And that's why the FileStore capabilities becoming important. So you're right. We definitely have continued to see a softness in the sale of some of the traditional products.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Does that mean then that your product portfolio is just sort of outdated? And if you could just -- you mentioned that there were some deals that closed in July. Can you tell us how much they were worth?", "Enrique Salem", "Probably not in a position to really comment. We\u2019ve closed a number of deals at the beginning of this month or through July. I think what's going on, John, is it\u2019s really a move that we're seeing. And while we continue to do very well in a number of segments, we think that the future lies more in what we're doing with some of the new products with our Cluster File System and FileStore. The product portfolio, the largest companies in the world still depend on products like Storage Foundation and Storage Foundation HA. And my expectations are that, that will continue, and they\u2019ll continue to use it in many of business-critical applications. The other thing that we're seeing that we're encouraged by, is then some of the new deployments of virtualization technology, VMware and others, they're looking to us to help drive the improved SLA or availability. And so that's going to help us with some of the clustering technologies and some of the new capabilities that we'll be shipping that will support that environment. So ultimately, it's really a shift, I would say, from the architecture and the data center to what I'll call a much more distributed scale-out architecture. And that's why we shipped some of the new products that we\u2019re expecting to see some benefits as we go forward.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just have a question on margin. Obviously, if you look at your guidance for Q2, a bit below where consensus was. How do you guys think about operating , especially kind of on a go-forward basis, I guess from two perspectives: one is just the recognition of the written down deferred revenue over time and then just really kind of on an organic basis too?", "James Beer", "What we said in the last couple of months is that as we look through the next three-year period, we would be able to drive operating margins to 30% driven by the core products. Now in the interim, certainly on a GAAP revenue basis, that's going to impact the operating margins that we're reporting because of this deferred revenue haircut. Now I think once we get to FY '13, we will have, in essence, got through the effects on operating margin of that deferred revenue haircut. And I would look for the three acquisitions that we\u2019ve entered into recently to be added to operating margins at that time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "Enrique, just in terms of the lengthening sales cycles and some of the deals that slipped, was there any common characteristics that you saw in terms GO? Was this a more enterprise-related versus SMB? Can you give us a little more color in terms of what you actually saw?", "Enrique Salem", "I think it\u2019s the cautiousness we're seeing is bigger deals as those are going through more steps and it\u2019s taking a little bit longer to get through that procurement cycle. I would say we saw it both in the U.S. and in Europe. So it's not necessarily one geography, we just see a little bit more cautiousness in the larger deals.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "I think you mentioned that you don\u2019t believe there's any new competitive dynamic. It\u2019s just a timing issue?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes. I'm not seeing anything new on the competitive front. And as I mentioned, some of those bigger deals, a number of them have already closed.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Ventsi Stoichev", "Ventsi Stoichev for Sarah Friar. I had a quick question on geographies. I noticed that Europe was a little bit stronger than the U.S., and that\u2019s a little bit in contrast to what we\u2019ve seen from some other companies that have reported so far. What drove that? And do you expect that dynamic to remain the same during the next quarter or do you expect that to change?", "Enrique Salem", "Sure. If you look at the various geographies throughout Europe, one of the things that we saw was we definitely saw what we call central, which is Germany, Switzerland, that market, and what we call West, the French part of, actually performing well. That's what we saw in the June quarter. I would tell you that we're going to keep monitoring what\u2019s happening in Europe, as there\u2019s definitely a bit of a tone where people are a bit more cautious. And so we're monitoring it. But what we saw that drove our results was good performance by Backup Exec, quite frankly worldwide, including Europe, and then good performance in Central Europe and the Western or French part of Europe.", "Ventsi Stoichev", "What was the issue in the U.S.? Is it just overall the lengthening  procurement cycle?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, that's correct.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Can you guys talk about on the consumer side from an operating expense perspective, where you stand in terms of the transition from Digital River onto your own platform? And how we should be thinking about kind of leverage and profitability in that business going forward? And kind of where you think growth will be at the back half of the year?", "Enrique Salem", "Let me take the first part and then I\u2019m going to let James continue. So what we're really pleased about is that we have successfully completed that transition. When we announced it in October, we said we would be done by the end of June and now we've done that. And what we\u2019re pleased about is that we now have complete control of the experience. And what does that mean? That means our ability to upsell to the suites, that it means the ability to cross-sell other capabilities. And so our ability to take over the whole experience is something that we\u2019re very pleased about. With some of the details on the financials, I\u2019ll let James take that.", "James Beer", "Yes. In terms of the expenses around the new eCommerce platform, our day-to-day operating expenses, if you will, our effectively in place. We've now fully transitioned. So the people running the platform are with us. Now we also, of course, have started the depreciation process of what we invested in the platform, so that will play out over the next three years or so. Net nettable [ph] of that is that in past quarters, we've talked about the eCommerce platform development being dilutive to margins. We're pretty much through that effect and we\u2019d look for a positive impact on margins overall in the back half of this fiscal year.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then just following up on the strength in Norton 360. If I look at that business, if you back out upsell, are you growing your Consumer business from a units perspective? I mean, it seems to me that the key driver here is upsell. Would that business be growing without the trade up to the suite side?", "Enrique Salem", "Well, the Consumer business is being driven by a couple of factors. I mean, the suites is a part of it. I think renewal rates we\u2019ve talked about with regards to the Norton 360 product, when people use backup, we see improvements in the renewal rates. And then of course the other thing that we just talked about was the work around eCommerce platform. And so those things are driving the growth. So the combination of the move to suites, the better renewal rates and the move to the eCommerce platform are all benefits.", "James Beer", "And the other thing I would add to that, of course, is that we\u2019ve got a wide variety of distribution paths for our Consumer business, both the range of OEM providers that we\u2019ve further added to in the past quarter, as well as retail. So I think we\u2019re unique in having this breadth of distribution.", "Enrique Salem", "And the other thing I\u2019d just add on, just one last thought, is the PC Tools. We're definitely getting that out there a little bit more.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess my issue, I\u2019m struggling with the fact that you guys got hit with a $0.02 impact in Q4 off of HP shipments. Same thing in the March quarter. And yet it doesn't look like the Consumer business is really accelerating and I would think that those units should be starting to transition into paid conversion.", "Enrique Salem", "Our expectation continues to be, and we monitor of those renewal rates very, very closely. And so there is that lag. We'll keep monitoring it. But 6%, I guess on a constant currency basis, I feel pretty good about a 6% year-over-year growth and our expectations are \u2013 and what we achieved was in line with our expectations.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "Maybe I'll just ask a quick follow-up to that question on the Consumer business. Obviously, there's a lag effect with consumer PC shipments in your business. As we\u2019ve seen the consumer PC market accelerate for the last several quarters now starting to weaken a little bit, when do you think that tail would sort of peak for you all? And you think the recent weakness in the consumer market might actually start to impact your business?", "Enrique Salem", "So when you say that tail, the tail on the growth rate?", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "Right. So if you were to look at the PC market and the relative impact on your business, there's a little bit of the lag obviously. As consumer market accelerated and basically peaked in the spring, and now it\u2019s starting to decelerate a little again, you all haven\u2019t yet seen the peak impact of that acceleration. When do you think would you see that?", "Enrique Salem", "What you have to look at with the RPC business is you end up getting deferred revenue, and it's recognized ratably. So we've gone through and you look at the seasonality, it's pretty clear to me, December and March are the seasonally strongest quarters, tails off through going into the middle of summer and then we start re-accelerating as we get back to the holiday season. So that's consistent what we've seen every year. And so my expectation is you'll see the same thing again through this fiscal year. So it kind of slows a little bit as people go on holiday and then it picks up into the holiday season.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "If I could just ask a follow-up on the license revenue in the quarter. And I apologize if I missed this earlier. But as you look at the number that's sort of down 17% year-on-year in Q1, could you walk through some of the relative impacts there? Obviously, the Sun business might have been a negative impact. But can you give us sort of what you thought were the different impacts on that? And how do you think about that turning around as you get a little bit deeper into an improved IT spending environment?", "Enrique Salem", "You did mention one of the components, which is we are still lapping the year-over-year impacts on the Sun business. And so I think we're getting to the tail end of that effect. I think we'll probably see that start leveling off, and then it's a matter of us, through our own sales force, driving those products into the breadth of platforms, whether it be Sun, Oracle-Sun, HP, IBM. And so our expectation is we're starting to hit the bottom of that effect. I think the other side of it is we continue to simplify, as you heard our Analyst Day, what Francis deSouza and his team are doing is creating a much simpler approach to our security solutions where you've got four suites. By simplifying the message which lines up to what customers are expecting, which is how do they get away from lots and lots of point products. That should also benefit us. So when I look across bottoming out on the Storage side; improvements in security; also the strength of the new NetBackup and Backup Exec releases; and then lastly, we did see double-digit growth in that SaaS business. So that combination of things should start seeing an improvement in new license growth.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go ahead and go next to Daniel Ives with FBR.", "Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "With the September quarter, are there any one-time OEM payments baked into the number?", "Enrique Salem", "I don't know of any one-time payment that we are expecting\u2026", "James Beer", "It would be a run rate type OEM activity.", "Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay, so you're saying the $0.04 from the acquisitions is the only, well say like one-time type of things that we weren't seeing three months ago?", "James Beer", "Yes. I would say that I would expect OEM cash fees as well as OEM OpEx to be up year-over-year. So that's certainly a pressure point for us in the short run.", "Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "I know you're not giving guidance, but how should you think about operating margins rest of the year?", "James Beer", "Well, in terms of the operating margin and just again, to really focus on what I was saying earlier about the three-year look. Clearly, this year, we've got $0.11 of dilution that is going to be driven from the three acquisitions. And that's very much a function of this deferred revenue haircut that we've been talking about. We'll get through that process in the next couple of years. We'll have fully lapped that effect, if you will. And so I think the acquisitions will be improving operating margins at FY '13 and that the core will be driving a 30% operating margin at that time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Philip Rueppel with Wells Fargo.", "Philip Rueppel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "You talked about the slowdown or the deal slippage at the enterprise level. Implicit in your 2Q guidance, are you sort of lowering your expected deal close rates on those big deals or on big deals in general? I guess another way to ask it is, do you expect sort of a similar selling environment to continue through Q2?", "Enrique Salem", "That is my expectation and that\u2019s what\u2019s figured into our guidance, is that what we saw \u2013 I\u2019m pleased with having closed some of the deals that we were targeting in June. But as we go through this quarter, I expect that the procurement cycles will remain about the same. We come through the summer, and so that's planned into our guidance for the September quarter.", "Philip Rueppel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Sort of shifting to the SMB area, you had sort of talked qualitatively about some progress you'd made there, especially in the Security side. Could you give us a little color on that segment of the business in Q1?", "Enrique Salem", "So when you look at the products in that segment, Backup Exec and Symantec Endpoint Protection, Symantec Protection Suites are the key products. We continue to make good progress with the launch of Backup Exec and the adoption of the suites is continuing in the SMB segment in security suites. Obviously, we continue to look at opportunities to reach more of that segment. As you know, it's very diverse. But we definitely have continued plans. And I made comments, one of the things that we're doing is specializing our partners. Because what we found is the more specialized they are, the more effective they are, especially in that SMB segment. And so we\u2019re going to continue to do that and my sense is that will continue to drive better performance for the security products and better performance for storage and backup products. Last comment, we shipped the new product, Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection. That is a hosted version of our Endpoint Security technology. And the initial feedback on that has been very good and that serves that SMB segment very well. So this is another addition to the segment that I think will help improve, continue to improve performance.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Heather Bellini with ISI Group.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Ryan Leaf [ph] in for Heather. Just had a quick question about the enterprise markets. Last quarter, you guys mentioned that you didn\u2019t see any net pricing or pricing pressures or any changes in the deal size. Are you guys seeing any changes there? Are you seeing more of pricing pressures?", "Enrique Salem", "Well one of the things that we monitor very carefully is discounting. And what our results are showing is we do not see any increased pressure to further discount our products. And so comparable to previous quarters, no increased pricing pressure. And my expectation is that we are now reached a stable state from a pricing perspective.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And in terms of the average of deals size, are people still opting for one-year deals, as opposed to\u2026", "Enrique Salem", "Correct. Yes, they are.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "With respect to the weakness, any specific verticals you guys have seen it in or it was broad-based?", "Enrique Salem", "I made comments about strength in the public sector and governments around the world. When you look at the verticals, there continue to be a number of verticals that continue to perform well. We definitely have seen a more cautious tone that's fairly global, meaning U.S., Europe and across verticals, with the best performance really coming from the public sector.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Kind of just maybe more of a \u2013 I don\u2019t know how you guys want to address the answer to the following question. But what kind of a strategic thinking \u2013 how\u2019s the board thinking about strategic direction?  Is the board happy about how the business has been progressing over the past couple of quarters? Apparently, the Storage business is kind of lagging and you want to pull it two steps back [ph]. What's kind of the internal thinking?", "Enrique Salem", "When we did our Analyst Day, is we spent some time sharing what we see the future of IT, what it looks like, and our expectations for that future. And so we\u2019ve shared that with our board, with all of you. We'll continue to iterate on what are the capabilities, what are our opportunities for monetizing that vision. And so our expectations are that we've set a direction for our company that takes advantage of where we are very strong and then outlines what our expectations are. Because things like consumerization, that is the big trend that Symantec is uniquely positioned to take advantage of given the size and scale of our Consumer business. And so when we talk to our board, what we do is we paint a complete picture that says here's the strengths of our portfolio, here's the potential weaknesses and where there\u2019s some level of risk, and then here's where we're going with the company. And the reception that I've gotten externally -- and I was with the CIOs around the world, I was in Europe two weeks ago, met with a number of CIOs here in the U.S. over the last month, and they understand our vision. They see that this notion of protecting information, protecting people, securing identities, they're very encouraged by where we're going with the company. And I think that's what's important right now, is to execute against the current product offering and sell what we've got, but also start moving towards the direction that this new vision has outlined for Symantec.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is John Dorose [ph] for Michael. You mentioned strength in the public sector this quarter. Some other IT vendors out there are expecting some weakness in the federal vertical and the September quarter. Are you baking in any softness from the private sector into your guidance for September?", "Enrique Salem", "We just finished our business reviews for the September quarter last week. We had presentations that covered all segments. We look at plans and forecasts. We looked at pipelines. And so at this point, we've taken into account more the pipeline view and our expectations for the public sector. And we think that, that's all baked into our guidance. The other part that's important is with the acquisition of GuardianEdge, that is a product that\u2019s done very well in the public sector and that's now added to our portfolio. And what it does is when you take a small company and you add it to Symantec where buyers, especially the federal government where we have a lot of great relationships, there\u2019s going to be more confidence in working with us than working with a small company. And given the certifications they have and the capabilities, that is a plus for us in the public sector. And so we feel good about our ability to achieve our forecast in the public sector.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just one more on the go-to-market strategy.  I know previously you\u2019ve tested out separating Storage and Security. With the weakness in Storage this quarter, is there any looking at maybe going back to that?", "Enrique Salem", "What we have done is our sales force continues to have a flying formation or alignment that matches up to the products in the portfolio. That's when we deal with the largest enterprises where the Enterprise segment. When we go down to smaller customers, I've been talking about this specialization in the partner community. And so we\u2019re going to continue to do that. No now we've got partners who are very good on our Storage Management products. We have partners who are very good on our backup products, very good on our DLP products. So what we're trying to do is drive much more specialization that will allow better results, we think, across the product portfolio. And as far as our sales force, I'm comfortable with how we go to market with our own people.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ed with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Back to the enterprise Storage Management business. You commented that you're seeing cycle lengthening, but I\u2019d appreciate if you could provide just some color on your overall pipelines? Have the pipelines change, have closed rates change or are we seeing what had been more of just-in-time approach to purchasing -- focusing on larger deals that take longer to get through the pipeline?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at the overall picture, the pipelines are as robust as they've been. I haven't seen a change in the ratios. Given the procurement component and the extra approvals and some of the discussions that have gone on, we did see a slight change in the close rate for some of the bigger deals. When you look at the other segments, SMB, we didn't see that, for example, in products like Backup Exec and some of our suites. So it would be more pipeline ratios seem to be appropriate. We do see a little bit close rates in the larger deals decreasing a little bit. And then we also, our expectation is that, that will continue in this quarter.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "On the consumer, will you track the conversion of trial to paid? What are the dynamics in that market for your OEM relationships? Are you seeing fairly consistent conversion rates?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look across the board, we track that very closely. And at this point, nothing that is unexpected, especially as we go into the summer period. Obviously, we're always looking forward to the holiday season and then at the beginning of the New Year. But so far, we tracked it carefully and we haven't seen any bigger changes there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "Question on the consumer fronts again. I think you said you were happy with roughly the 6%, 7% constant currency. Do you expect any acceleration there, just from the standpoint that you talked I think at your Analyst Day about a high single-digit three-year CAGR. So is that coming down more to the mid-single digit range here? And also on the consumer front, what are you seeing out that the freemuim vendors in the marketplace right now?", "Enrique Salem", "So Rob, just to be clear, it is 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported. Sorry if I -- I just want to clear in that number. When you look at the marketplace, this level of growth, plus or minus anyone quarter, it\u2019s going to move around. So I think we are in the right range. That's 7% plus or minus is probably around right. Could be a little higher, could be a little lower. When we look at the freemuim market, we haven't seen any dramatic changes in that marketplace, and quite frankly,  we\u2019re pleased because you take the PC Tools offerings and what we\u2019ve done, which was our initial strategy, is we\u2019re better positioning PC Tools to go after the more price-sensitive, buyers, to go after the freemuim or lower-cost solutions or offerings. And so we've got that combination and we think we\u2019ve got the mix about right, right now with our high-end premium Norton product and then PC Tools at the low end.  And we think that\u2019s going to combat the freemuim vendors.  The other thing I commented on is that we now have PC Tools also available in many of the markets where the freemuim vendors have historically done well, not just emerging markets, but parts of Europe.  So I think that will also help.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "Apologize if I missed it. What is the tax rate guidance for Q2 and/or for the year?", "James Beer", "So for Q2, the tax rate guidance is 28%. That's before any consideration of losses around the JV.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Neil Herman with Soleil Securities.", "Neil Herman - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Could you talk a little bit about the competition in the Storage and Server space vis-\u00e0-vis EMC, if you're seeing any significant changes there? You had also mentioned that one of your goals is obviously license growth. Could you kind of give us a sense as to your hopes, expectations in terms of getting back to year-over-year license revenue growth?", "Enrique Salem", "When we look at the competitive-like [ph] marketplace, we are doing very well. We are gaining share in the backup market. As you can see, Backup Exec has done well; NetBackup has done well. And so from our point of view, obviously, looking at the deals that we're closing there across all competitors, we are gaining share the backup space. What we are doing, though, is we\u2019ve got to make sure that we take advantage of this move to data deduplication and our new offerings. Our NetBackup appliances are now shipping. And so to that will continue to help us in that more pliant deduplication marketplace. But we are gaining share in the backup space. When you talk about the new license growth, it really is a matter of executing across the portfolio: driving more DLP, driving the new solutions from backup, driving the Software-as-a-Service opportunity. And so to get that back in place, those things I just outlined have to become a larger total percentage of the overall business.  And that\u2019s what we're seeing as we see double-digit growth in both DLP and Software-as-a-Service. Now they\u2019re coming off a smaller base, but as that continues, that should be a positive towards new license growth.", "Neil Herman - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Is the transition to SaaS, do you think, having an impact on license revenue growth?  Are you finding customers are choosing to move in that direction as opposed to the historic license purchases?", "Enrique Salem", "We definitely are seeing a move towards more subscription-oriented buying. And when you look at that number and some of my comments, I talked about the offerings we\u2019re making to our partners where they can sell more of a subscription model.  So we definitely see a shift towards more subscription-oriented businesses than what I call the tradition, just pure license maintenance business.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Same question that Neil just asked, but on the Security side. Can you talk about competition this quarter? Run rate? How often did you see McAfee or Sophos or some other vendors thing?", "Enrique Salem", "We're doing great in the bigger deals where we're competing on security front, we're doing very, very well. And it's really a matter of looking at the whole portfolio, because we've got a set of products that match up to a number of competitors, McAfee trend and others. And then they've got some products that are not consistent with us. And as we go into the new product lines, the encryption and now the identity security that comes from the VeriSign acquisition, we\u2019ll again have some other capabilities that are different and differentiating from a number of our traditional competitors. One thing I'm very pleased about is we're seeing Symantec Protection Center, SPC, not only get reviewed well, but customers are very pleased with its capabilities, its user interfaces reporting versus EPL.  And that\u2019s been another big positive for us, as that was one of the concerns customers had several years ago.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Did you talk about Altiris? How did that product do everything with Windows 7 upon us that you could be seeing some good uptake there.", "Enrique Salem", "I didn't make any specific comments on the Altiris Suite. The full suite\u2019s available. We shipped the last components just recently. We\u2019ve got an update coming out. And you\u2019re right. A number of our customers are using it for the roll out of Win 7. And Win 7 in the enterprise, that process is starting and we expect that to continue, quite frankly, for the next 24 months or so.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Richard Williams with Cross Research.", "Richard Williams - Cross Research", "Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of the geographies for the deal slippage? Was that specific to any one geography?", "Enrique Salem", "What we saw was specifically around the U.S. and Europe is where we saw some of the deal slippage.", "Richard Williams - Cross Research", "Anything in the SMB space?", "Enrique Salem", "The volumes of deals in SMB space are very, very high. So from a close rate perspective, we didn't see any changes there. And Backup Exec, quite frankly, did well. So nothing really that I can report or comment on in SMB.", "Richard Williams - Cross Research", "Then just the weakness we heard from other software vendors reporting recently that the last few days of June, they saw large deals just disappear. Is, I guess, similar to what you saw?", "Enrique Salem", "We saw the longer procurement cycles. I don't know if they disappeared for us. It's just a matter of they pushed into the new quarter and a good percentage of them have closed. So I can't say that they've disappeared. We had a very detailed conference call and planning sessions that we've done over the first three weeks of July to make sure we were tracking those deals. And I don't know of any of the larger deals that we were tracking that completely disappeared. They're all there.", "Richard Williams - Cross Research", "Any grouping by industry?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes. Across the verticals, we're in so many verticals that it's hard to say one vertical saw a bigger change than the other. The positiveness came from the public sector, state and local; continued to do well.", "Operator", "And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Enrique Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique Salem", "Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. While we saw some challenges in the June quarter, we remained focused in our key priorities for this fiscal year. The consumer and enterprise products we offer are more capable and valuable to our customers than ever before. And our recent acquisitions strengthen our product portfolio, enabling us to better serve customers. I look forward to speaking with you again soon.

We know we have more to do, but we are convinced we have the right leader at the top.

Customers around the world understand the benefits of a more standardized operating environment, which enables them to reduce the complexity and the cost of managing their infrastructure.

These metrics underscore how our sales force realignment has improved our ability to cross-sell the broad portfolio of products. ", "I would like to highlight a couple of the larger deals that illustrates the breadth of our products we are selling with customers around the world. ", "We signed a multi-million dollar deal with a global financial services firm. They purchased a combination of security and availability solutions. As we were negotiating the renewal of an existing contract with this firm, we were able to demonstrate the value of consolidating more of the client\u2019s data center infrastructure software through a thoughtful ROI analysis. The net result was a much larger transaction that was expanded to include anti-virus, anti-spam, ghost, storage foundation, net backup, and our cluster server products. ", "We also gained a new customer in one of the world\u2019s leading energy companies. They worked with our consulting team to strengthen their policy and endpoint compliance initiatives. We tailored a solution for them using our Symantec control compliance suite that helps enterprises implement, measure, and maintain compliance with security configuration standards. This solution includes technologies that we acquired from both BindView and Sygate.

We are encouraged by the early positive feedback from our customers. ", "Our services group posted another strong quarter, growing 14% year over year. The consulting group played a key role in the number of the deals for us during the quarter.

It is important to note that although launching our 2007 products on time was an important objective for the consumer team, it did not have a material impact on revenue in the September quarter.

", "Operator", "We will go first to Adam Holt with JP Morgan. ", "Adam Holt - JP Morgan", "Good afternoon. My first question is about revenue versus deferred revenue, particularly on the enterprise side. I was hoping maybe you could help us reconcile what looks like bookings that came in a little bit better than expected with deferred revenue a little bit ahead of expectations, with a little bit of weakness in the enterprise. I was wondering if you could talk about how you are managing what gets recognized in the quarter versus what goes into deferred, and whether or not there were any transactions you thought you might see in the quarter that end up going into the balance sheet. ", "John W. Thompson", "Adam, I think the answer here is that we do not make decisions about what goes to deferred or what gets recognized. That is a function of the accounting principles and accounting standards that we follow, so it is not an arbitrary decision that we get to make at the end of the quarter. However, we have set up a business model over the course of the last few years that acknowledges that the value of our deferred revenue pool will streamline and stabilize reported results over time, and hence it has a dampening effect in the early term as we are setting it up, but delivers consistency and predictability over time. ", "If ever there was a statement of weakness in the quarter, it would be more transactions that we had in our forecast or expectations that did not occur, particularly in Europe. It is in that part of our business that we saw weakness that quite frankly impacted our ability to hit the mid- or high-end of the guided range. ", "We are pleased that we were able to come in at the low-end of the range, but we are disappointed that we could not get better performance out of Europe. ", "Adam Holt - JP Morgan", "If I could, my follow-up is along that line. As you look into the December quarter and the guidance for the December quarter, is the expectation that you see a recovery in those regions that were weak, or have you taken a more conservative view of closed rates, et cetera, as you built out the December quarter guidance for Europe?", "John W. Thompson", "I think it would be fair to say, Adam, that much of the problem in Europe was isolated to one particular region, although you could find a country or a team that did not perform as they would have forecasted, but the single largest problem was in the central region, which is Germany. Germany is suffering from its own set of economic woes, and we have our own set of issues there, because we have chosen to make leadership changes because of our dissatisfaction, quite frankly, with the way that part of our business has been performing. That being said, the reaffirmation of our forecast suggests that we believe appropriately covered ourselves for what the results are likely to be in Europe. ", "Adam Holt - JP Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Heather Bellini with UBS. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "I actually just had a follow-up to Adam\u2019s question regarding the pipeline and your comment that it is stronger than ever. He was referring primarily to your business in Europe, but if you look overall across your business, can you give us an idea directionally, or talk to us a little bit about what you saw for a close rate this past quarter across the board in your enterprise business? Are you assuming an up-tick in your close rates for the December quarter in order to make the midpoint of the revenue guidance? Thank you. ", "John W. Thompson", "Heather, we do not typically talk about close rates. You will have a number of transactions that are in the queue for a given quarter that may or may not close, because they may push, and so one of the real issues with any enterprise sales force is do you have enough deals in the pipeline that have a reasonable enough chance to close that you can hit the forecast for the quarter. As was the case in the Americas, we saw deals push, but they did pretty well. We saw deals push in Europe, but they just did not have enough in the pipe to cover what the expectations were for the quarter. ", "My sense is that our enterprise pipeline is clearly larger than it has ever been. That is a statement of both number of transactions and value of the revenue that underpins those transactions. ", "Most importantly, our sales team is now starting to be able to sell across the portfolio. Sales productivity is up. Customer relationships are strengthening. Attrition rates are down. All of those things would lead us to believe that we can certainly deliver the forecast that we put on the wall. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Directionally, would you comment on whether the close rate would be up or down from last quarter? ", "John W. Thompson", "I really do not know. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to John Walsh with Citigroup. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. Just on the large deals, up sequentially, the $1 million plus, and I think over $300,000 were basically flat, but on a year-over-year basis, they are down quite a bit. Is that primarily associated with the recognition now of deals and putting a portion into deferred? ", "James A. Beer", "No, I think you may be not quite correct there. The deals greater than $300,000 were actually up year over year around 15%, and the million dollar deal figure, which was 66 in this past quarter, was at 67 in the year-ago period. So really, very close to flat at that level. We have talked in the past about how we feel as though the transactions of greater than $300,000 are probably the best indicator as to the progress we have made in terms of sales force integration. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Okay, and that would speak to the multiple products and the sales force being realigned going forward? You think that metrics on a sequential and a year-over-year basis should start to uncover some of those multiple product deals?", "James A. Beer", "Certainly the focus is very much on leveraging this breadth of product portfolio that we now have as a company, and I think that has resonated well with CIOs and other IT executives during the past quarter, and really, as John as talked about the strength of the product pipeline that we see, our view is that resonating effect will increase as we enter the busier time of the year. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Okay, just one quick follow-up on the consumer side with Vista. Could you give us an update on where you are at with Microsoft there? Thank you. ", "John W. Thompson", "All of our products will be Vista ready, so when Microsoft ships the final bits to OEM manufacturers, we will certainly have products in their hands shortly thereafter. Many of the statements that have been published or reported about Microsoft\u2019s plans are certainly encouraging to us. We now want to see more of the action that underlines or underpins those statements. ", "Their desire now to provide APIs to disable defender ware, we have the code to be able to do that. That is a very positive step. Their statements that they will provide APIs to allow us to turn off the Windows Security Center, we think that too is a positive step. ", "We have not seen all that we would like to see around kernel access or how we will manage in 64-bit environment with patch guard, but they have made statements that certainly represents significant movement from where they have stood for the last year to two years. ", "While progress has been made, it is our opinion that there is more that needs to be done to demonstrate true evidence of the commitment. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. John, just a bigger picture question first on the enterprise security area. What is the disconnect between when we do a lot of market growth surveys and so on, people talk about their security budgets still growing 10%, 12%, and yet you guys are sitting with 1% year-over-year growth this quarter? I guess the question is you should be benefiting consolidation towards the bigger vendors. Over time, should we start to see those growth rates come together as you hit your stride better?", "John W. Thompson", "I think some of this, Sarah, is a function of where customers might be investing and clearly, you have seen in the security space for the more well-established firms, lower growth rates over the last I would say several quarters to a year. That being said, in the segment of the security market where we have the largest portion of our revenue, that is antivirus or content filtering, it is clear that unit volumes are relatively flat to down slightly, and that price points continue to follow kind of the seasonal or annualized pattern of erosion. If you do not have rising volumes and you have normalized price erosion, you are going to see lower yield. ", "Our investments have been focused on moving the needle into compliance and moving into technologies that are more about data leakage and new areas for customers, and we think that is where we will get revenue lift in the out quarters, as we see a continued erosion, if you will, in the revenue yield in the core AV business. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Then, just a quick follow-up on the margin side. James, you said you expect that gross margins trend higher, now that you have gotten rid of some of these one-offs like the obsolescence on the appliance side, I think that you said. What is a reasonable expectation for the second-half? Is it back up closer to 85% gross margin, where you were through fiscal year \u201906?", "James A. Beer", "Sarah, I am afraid I am going to have to dodge that question. I think I will just leave it at the fact that we would expect gross margins and operating margins to both be trending upwards. We are in the seasonally stronger half of the year, and we will work on it. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Fair enough. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Two follow-up questions on the consumer side. First, in terms of the Vista question that was asked earlier, not so concerned in terms of what Microsoft is doing, but how do you think from a unit perspective, the introduction of a new OS is going to impact your business? Do you see it as a potential catalyst, or do you see a potential slowdown around the holiday season until it actually starts to ship?", "John W. Thompson", "Todd, it is my sense that the market excitement around the new release of an operating system has become less and less since Windows 95. Candidly, I do not see people lined up running into the stores to buy a Vista-enabled machine, and so I do not know that it is going to have a pausing effect or, quite frankly, an afterburner or booster effect on our business at all. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Second question for you on the consumer side. Can you give us some feel for when your OEM relationship with HP comes up for renewal? What kind of impact is that having on your business today, if you look at incremental new customers? How much of that is being driven by HP versus other channels?", "John W. Thompson", "HP is certainly our largest OEM partner. They are also the largest provider of PCs to consumers in the world, so that relationship is awfully, awfully important to us. I would rather not talk about the date terms associated with the contract, because it is between us and HP. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Could you tell us if it is up for renewal in the first-half of calendar next year?", "John W. Thompson", "No, it is not. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. ", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Just looking back at your European operations, you mentioned obviously some slippage on the enterprise side, but I am wondering if you could mention if there is any distinction between more the security sections of your business, or the storage side. Also, in the services line, down a couple of million sequentially. I am wondering if anything is going on there, and sort of what your expectation for growth is there going forward?", "John W. Thompson", "We believe that our services business will clearly hit our guided target for the year. The fact that it is down sequentially has more to do with the seasonality of that business than anything. It is a people-based business. The summertime is in fact a time when people take vacations and therefore there are no billings associated with their activity. So I am not at all bothered by a sequential decline in services. That is just the norm, if you will, for a people-based business. ", "With respect to Europe, I think the statement that was made by one of our guys really does reflect some of what is going on there, and that is our European team has lost their security swagger. They have not quite figured out how to embrace the totality of what we have in our portfolio, and take those offerings to the marketplace in the same manner that we have been in other parts of the world. That is unfortunate, but it is something that will be fixed in due time. I am not worried about it long-term. ", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great, and then also just back to the cost of goods sold line. I am just wondering if you could set sort of what your long-term expectation there is.

", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Company", "I just wanted to follow-up on the bookings and deferred revenue piece. I calculate the non-GAAP revenue up about $6 million. I am wondering, James, if you could tell us the currency impact on the non-GAAP deferred revenue?", "James A. Beer", "Let\u2019s see, the currency impact between this point, the end of September and the end of the previous quarter?", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Company", "Exactly, sequential. ", "James A.

I am wondering if you could give us any sense of an early read on that, and what types of customers you are seeing buy that.

We literally launched the product near the end of the quarter, so nothing in the September quarter results in any material way reflects Norton Confidential. ", "Norton Confidential Online Edition is targeted at our enterprise customers who will buy the product for distribution to their online customers. So it is way for them to help deliver confidence, if you will, which is one of the real challenges that we are starting to see with all for the fraud and identity theft activity that has gone on around the world -- mostly in the U.S., I must admit. ", "So this is a slight change in the model, but it is one that allows us to monetize the relationship with a consumer in a different way than we have in the past. ", "James A. Beer", "Walter, let me just confirm, on the first question that you asked, since the end of the last fiscal year, we have seen appreciation of around 5% in terms of the dollar-euro relationship. So between the end of the fiscal year of \u201906 and the end of the September quarter, you should use a 5% number. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Company", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Two quick questions. James, obviously everybody wants to know where gross margins are going. Could you at least tell us what the impact was for the discontinuation for the appliance and that impact?", "James A. Beer", "We are not breaking out the dollars, per se. I would say that was the smaller of the two items that I mentioned. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "John, maybe one follow-up question for you. As you look at the new consumer products coming out, and I know it is early to talk about pricing, but can you talk directionally, how you see going to market and educating users, trying to get them to upgrade, obviously, to what I would assume would be a higher feature, higher price point product, but can you talk directionally about those comments?", "John W. Thompson", "Yes, but before I go there, let me make a comment on the question on margins. I think as our business mix continues to evolve, hence as we add more services to our solution portfolio, the optimization point for this company is more about its operating line, operating margin line, not just its gross margin line. ", "I think you guys, as you analyze our company, have to have expectations that we are going to manage op-ex to deliver the right operating margins that delivers the right net income that delivers the right EPS. We will do whatever we have to do at the op-ex line, given whatever the gross margins become at the top. ", "Now, on Norton 360, I assume that is the product you are asking about, we are in a controlled beta -- a rather extensive controlled beta, I might add -- right now, where the most significant feature addition in that product compared to what we have in the market today, is online back-up. ", "It is our belief that there are many, many, many more customers out there who have interest in not just back-up, but online back-up because of the potential ease and convenience that it might offer them for not just their MP3 files and their digital photos, but targeted at small business users who may have five to 10 PCs in their operation. ", "We have not priced the product yet. We certainly have a range of expectations as to where the product will be released, but we are not going to disclose that until we are ready to release the product itself. ", "We think the first target buyers are in fact existing Symantec, either NAV, that is Norton Antivirus, or NIS, Norton Internet Security users. We also think it represents an opportunity for us to go back into some of the OEM manufacturers that we have worked with in the past and offer them a different kind of solution for them to consider versus what some of our competitors might have. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Thank you. I was actually going to ask about the operating margin. If I go to the midpoint of your guidance, it looks like it is going to be up about 150 basis points in December, and then flat from there in March. Is that right?", "James A. Beer", "Again, we are not going to try to get into the specifics of how we see the margins moving around in the next couple of quarters, but again, we think that the trend at both the operating and gross line is positive. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "A quick question on the European business. Does that business come back, or are you losing some market share?", "James A. Beer", "We very much have looked through the deals that pushed, and are of the view that those are still available to us. In fact, a good number of those have already come through the door. So no, we are not losing these transactions to other competitors. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Last question, when is the beta of Norton 360 going to be out?", "John W. Thompson", "There is a controlled beta in the marketplace right now. It has just shy of 20,000 users who are working with our engineering team. As we continue to iterate that, we will put out a press release when we are ready for an extended beta, and that would be a beta that would hit tens of thousands of people around the world. Just keep watching your screen. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Will do. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Ed Maguire with Merrill Lynch. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could comment on what the impact of exiting the UTM market may have had on your security business, and also talk a little about your expectations for the ramp-up for the alliance with Juniper?  ", "John W. Thompson", "Clearly we booked less business there this quarter, Ed, than we did in prior quarters, by a marginal amount but it is not a whole lot that it is going to make a material difference in the company\u2019s reported results. So we wouldn\u2019t dare want to hide under that rock, suggesting that because we exited the UTM business, that is why our security and data management group is weak. There are other issues that we have to continue to work on. ", "The relationship with Juniper we believe can leverage both companies\u2019 strengths. Juniper is a terrific hardware provider at the network tier. They have great relationships with a lot of the large, network operators, and as you think about the emerging world, where the switching fabric has become very fast, and therefore what they need to provide is more content, or more performance and capability in the switch, our software products start to make more sense for them. ", "Being able to deliver our intrusion prevention products, our content filtering technologies, all of the things that we do so well from a software perspective on their converged JUN OS/NET OS platform, is going to be a boost for I think both companies. Now, we are talking about a program that does not start to deliver revenue, I suspect, for another couple, three quarters, given that there is still engineering work that has to be done. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "A follow-up on operating costs. You had spoken about some new facilities expansion in India, and just from a very high level, what are your thoughts towards headcount expansion? Are you looking to move any of your existing positions off-shore, at least for this fiscal year? What are your hiring plans?", "John W. Thompson", "We have been on a fairly aggressive ramp to hire through the first half of the year. Candidly, hiring will slow in the second-half of the year, because we think we are about right in terms of net adds. Now what we will be doing is hiring to address attrition. ", "With respect to India, we have had a well-established position in Pune for quite some time. Both BindView and Veritas had large, large engineering populations there. We have grown those populations since we acquired both companies. ", "What we felt we needed to do was to spread out a bit so we were not so dependent upon one skill pool, or one location for our skilled people. Hence, Chennai represents the second site. It is not unlike what any company would do here, even in the U.S., much less in India. ", "We expect that over the course of the next few years, the population in India could reach 3,500 to 4,000 people, which is double what it is today. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Susquehana Financial Group.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehana Financial Group", "Thank you, and good afternoon. John, with the level of marketing spend in light of what you were expecting in Q2, and how are you thinking about consumer marketing activities over the rest of the fiscal year?", "John W. Thompson", "The largest increase in spending this year, from a marketing perspective, or product management perspective, quite frankly, has been in our consumer business. I think the results of the consumer business certainly reflect that that investment was well-timed and well-placed. ", "Now, it would also suggest that we cannot rest on our laurels because we do not think Microsoft has fired all the salvos they have just yet. So we will continue to monitor activity at every channel level, at every distribution outlet, with every partner around the world, to make sure that we are incentivizing them the right way, and we are putting the right marketing air cover in place for our partners to move our products. ", "I think the team has done a terrific job of not just delivering great products, but getting the noise out and news out so that we are able to drive 12%, 13% growth for a business that is annualized now well over $1.5 billion. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehana Financial Group", "Just a follow-up for James. The bookings number overall was certainly solid in the quarter. On deferred revenues, the mix was a little more skewed towards long-term than I was expecting. I am just wondering if there was anything that kind of drove that up more. ", "James A. Beer", "No, other than the types of bookings that we were able to bring in during the quarter. This has been somewhat of a consistent trend, I would say, actually in recent times, and I would expect that could well continue. Certainly the length of a lot of our enterprise deals is increasing, and we are pleased to see that. ", "That is the sort of trend that underlines all of this. Certainly the largest deals tend to have the longer terms. ", "Helen Corcos", "We have time for one more question. ", "Operator", "Today\u2019s final question comes from Chris Hovis from Morgan Keegan. ", "Christopher Hovis - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "If you look at the guidance for the full fiscal year, what would you characterize as the factors that dictate whether you come in low-end or high-end, and specifically, which factors may be macro conditions versus things in your control? ", "John W. Thompson", "Chris, as is the case in every single quarter, the thing that influences where we land is how well we execute around the world. How well we build products, how well we support customers, how well we engage in our consulting business, whether or not our sales force is on point and able to close the deals in the forecasted time frame that they have put before me and the sales leadership team.", "This is all about execution. There is no place for us to hide if we do not make these numbers. It will be a function of us not delivering on what we said, hence us not executing. ", "James A. Beer", "A couple of the things, obviously that just mechanically will drive the figures will be things such as the exchange rate. We are using $1.24 per euro in the guidance that we have offered this afternoon, and of course, the share price will dictate a couple of things. First of all, how many shares we are able to buy back over the next six months, and then also the number of common share equivalents that we will include in the denominator of the calculation. That is going to drive the number of stock options that count in the denominator, as well as the number of shares that would be driven by the convertible debt. ", "There are some mechanical elements to the calculation, but as John says, really, top-line execution and a close focus on our spending is going to be the key. ", "Christopher Hovis - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Thompson for concluding remarks. ", "John W. Thompson", "Thank you very much for joining us on the call this afternoon. While our results certainly achieved the low-end of our guided range, we know we have more work to do, specifically in Europe, to improve our performance to hit our full-year guidance. However, I am quite pleased with the strength of our pipeline, the productivity of our sales force, the excitement that we see in our channel partners and our customers, and confirm and reaffirm that we can make 5.2 to 5.4.

(Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helen Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. ", " Helen Corcos", " Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are John Thompson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec; and James Beer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "In a moment, I will turn the call over to John. He will provide some comments on our fiscal third quarter 2007 results which ended December 29, 2006. He will then turn the call over to James who will provide some additional financial details. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. ", "Today's call is being recorded and will available for replay on the Symantec Investor Relations home page at Symantec.com/invest. A copy of today's press release is available on our web site and a copy of today's prepared comments will be available on the investor's relations website shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue and operating results for the coming quarter and fiscal year, and projections of deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition related intangibles and stock based compensation contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement and include the risks associated with our expected adoption of staff accounting bulletin 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. ", "Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results which can be found in the press release and on the investor relations website. ", "Now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. John Thompson. ", " John Thompson", "Thanks, Helen. As we discussed last week, our December quarter results were weaker than we expected, driven by a number of factors. First, in our data center management business we saw a higher than expected number of multi-year maintenance contracts which resulted in lower revenue, or recognized revenue. Correspondingly, we saw much higher deferred revenue for the quarter which will bode well for us over the next year or more. ", "Next, a number of our largest transactions carried unique terms and conditions or important services or new product content, both of which resulted in less period revenue. ", "Finally, we incurred higher than expected costs primarily associated with the negative impact of foreign currency and business process changes implemented during our system's consolidation. ", "Typically, December is a high renewal period for data center management group. This past quarter was no exception. Our analysis of the record number of multi-million dollar transactions booked during the quarter revealed a much higher proportion of deals that ended up in deferred revenue. Additionally, lower than expected new license sales, or some transactions with unique terms and conditions result in lower period revenue. An example of this might be a transaction for new licenses coupled with a multi-year maintenance renewal where we chose to offer installment payment terms as an alternative to deeper discounting of the important annuity revenue stream associated with the renewal of maintenance. ", "We think this is a natural maturation phenomena in some of our business segments. Therefore, we have recalibrated our financial model to account for a lower revenue yield per transaction as well as lower revenue growth rate assumptions for some of the more mature markets we address. It is conceivable it will take two or three more quarters for the effects of this to flow through our P&L. ", "Now I'll move to the expense side of the equation. Overall, we consider the business process changes implemented with the systems consolidation important to scaling our business and lowering our cost over time. Systems changes such as these certainly don't come without issues and we may have had more than our fair share of them with this set of changes where we incurred higher expenses than planned and loss some revenue opportunities during the quarter. ", "There were several areas where we had to absorb additional labor and administrative costs. For example, we had to duplicate processing of some documents in order to complete transactions or records, as well as manually manage the SKU process for some of our partners around the globe. In addition, our enterprise support cost increased as we fielded that many more calls with longer than normal hold times. ", "Administrative challenges in our services business contributed to some lost revenue as we were not able to obtain the required data to support revenue for the period. Process problems affected the quality of the data which hampered our ability to recognize the revenue. However, we believe the major technical and process issues are now behind us. ", "With a disappointing quarter behind us, we are moving to better align our expenses with our new revenue expectations. As such, we plan to implement several expense reduction initiatives which James will explain in more detail in a minute. We believe these actions will result in annualized cost savings of approximately $200 million. ", "Also today we announced that the board of directors has authorized another $1 billion share repurchase program. Over the past eight quarters we have repurchased nearly $6 billion worth of our shares. As you can see, we remain committed to using our cash to drive growth and long-term value for our shareholders. ", "With that, I would like to shift the discussion to some of the important highlights of the December quarter. During the quarter, we booked a record 389 transactions valued at more than $300,000. In addition, we booked a record 112 deals worth more than $1 million, a 22% increase over the December 2005 period. In addition, nearly 80% of the transactions over $300,000 included multiple products or services. If anything, this suggests our sales force consolidation is clearly behind us and the teams are starting to build stronger relationships with our customers around the world. ", "In the December quarter, our security and data management group posted its biggest revenue quarter ever, growing 3% year over year and over 7% sequentially. Our End Point security solutions which include our Enterprise Antivirus and End Point compliance products posted record revenue for the quarter and grew modestly year-over-year. ", "Our policy compliance solutions, which helped customers manage in a rapidly changing governance and compliance environment, continued to receive strong market acceptance. The products posted double-digit year-over-year gains and continue to be a key element in our growth of our service business. ", "The consumer business grew 24% year over year and was the bright spot for the December quarter. Normalized for the ratable model change last year, this segment grew 19% year over year. Growth in this segment continues to be driven by our electronic distribution channels, new sales and marketing initiatives as well as new product launches. ", "With Microsoft's entry into the consumer security market, our objectives were to out-innovate them and improve the quality of every customer interaction with Symantec. On the innovation front, the fruits of our efforts are reflected in the numerous accolades that our 2007 versions of both Norton Internet Security and Norton Antivirus continue to receive around the globe. We continue to leverage our many years of security expertise to distance ourselves from both new and old competitors. We also continue to receive positive feedback on Norton Confidential, a new category-defining product for consumer transaction security; and the beta version of Norton 360 as well. Norton 360 is expected to launch by the end of March and we are already prepared to ship our Vista versions. ", "On the business model side, we offered an attractively priced multi-year subscription to our consumers with the expectations of ensuring their loyalty in the face of new competition. Based on changes in the competitive arena, including one here being a non-factor in the market, it became clear that we no longer need to offer such attractive prices for multi-year subscriptions. While we expect multi-year subscriptions to continue to be an element in our consumer business, the auto renewal implementation should be a more significant factor in the loyalty equation. ", "Additionally, our consumer business model now allows us to deliver unique and innovative technology enhancements to our customers at any point in the year, regardless of product cycles. Current subscribers to both Norton Internet Security and Norton Antivirus are eligible to receive a new technology we call Sonar which leverages technologies from our acquisition of Whole Security. Unlike other heuristic technologies, Sonar delivers an unprecedented level of zero day detection that automatically makes a determination of a threat and takes action without prompting the user to make a decision. ", "With several new Norton-branded products hitting the marketplace this quarter, we have plans for several exciting promotions. These promotions are focused on strengthening our position in the marketplace and driving awareness for Norton Confidential, Norton 360 and our Vista compatible solutions. ", "Turning to our services business, we continue to see strong traction in the services business, particularly when coupled with new license sales and with sales of our newer technologies. As I mentioned earlier, the actual performance of this group was better than the reported numbers suggest. Late in the December quarter, we acquired a U.K.-based professional services firm called Company I. Company I expands the capability of our consulting services group to help clients manage IT risk and costs particularly in the data center. We believe this addition will help us to develop even stronger relationships with our customers as they focus on important cost and compliance initiatives over the next few years. ", "So while we are certainly not satisfied with our December quarter results, we have many of the foundational elements in place to produce a more predictably consistent business and that is the overriding focus of our team as we move ahead. ", "Now I will turn to James for details about our financials. ", " James Beer", "Thank you, John and good afternoon, everyone. GAAP revenue for our December 2006 quarter was $1.313 billion. Non-GAAP revenue grew approximately 6% versus the December 2005 period to $1.324 billion. Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP revenue by almost $45 million in the December 2006 quarter as compared to December 2005. Sequentially, foreign currency movements had approximately a $7 million positive impact on revenue. ", "The December quarter's diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.12. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.26. International non-GAAP revenue for the December quarter grew 7% versus the year ago period to approximately $665 million and represented 50% of total non-GAAP revenue. ", "The Americas grew 5%. Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 11% and the Europe, Middle East, Africa region grew 5%. The EMEA region increased 7% from the September quarter. Excluding currency effects, EMEA revenue declined by 4% year-over-year. ", "Now I would like to move on to revenue by segment for the December 2006 quarter. Consumer revenue came in at $409 million. Up 24% versus the December 2005 quarter and up almost 4% sequentially. After normalizing the consumer business for the change in the business model whereby we now recognize revenue ratably, consumer growth was 19% year over year. Electronic distribution represented nearly 70% of consumer revenue and grew 35% compared to December 2005, driven primarily by strong activity from our online store subscription renewals and upgrades. From a product perspective Norton Internet Security revenue grew nearly 60% year-over-year and 10% sequentially and now represents approximately 60% of total consumer revenue. ", "Moving on to our enterprise segment. Security and data management revenue of $519 million grew by 3% over the December 2005 quarter. The data center management business generated revenue of $343 million, declining 8% from the December 2005 results. ", "Our services group generated revenue of approximately $53 million and represented approximately 4% of our total revenue. As we mentioned last week, the services business was negatively impacted by one-time administrative challenges as a result of the business process changes that occurred during the December quarter. ", "Non-GAAP gross margin was 82.9% for the December 2006 quarter. Gross margin was lower than expected, in part because our recognized revenue was lower than forecast, thus increasing the relative impact of the fixed costs imbedded within our cost of goods sold line. We also incurred higher enterprise technical support expenses as we added resources to address the business process changes associated with the conversion of our ERP systems. In the future, I expect that gross margins will be impacted by increases in OEM royalties in the consumer business and the expansion of our services activities. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses were $759 million for the December 2006 quarter, consistent with our full year operating expense guidance of $3 billion. Foreign currency negatively impacted operating expenses by approximately $20 million as compared to December 2005. As with the gross margin line, our operating margin was also impacted by expenses incurred to support our ERP systems conversion. While the majority of these costs are behind us, we will be spending a modest amount of incremental money during the March quarter to remediate the handful of issues remain. Of course, these efforts will also consume a portion of our IT resources as we work to optimize the capabilities of our new systems and processes. ", "As mentioned last week, we are taking several actions to manage our expenses consistent with our expectations for revenue. We have effectively frozen new hiring although we were not applying this measure to our research and development groups based in India and China. Our plan to expand these operations remains in place as we look to broaden our access to engineering talent on the worldwide basis. We will also reduce our current employee cost base by 5%, with an emphasis on minimizing the impact felt by our core engineering and customer facing teams. We will also lower our spending on contractors, consultants and travel-related expenses as well as continue our facilities consolidation activities around the world. ", "The savings goals of our business process reengineering teams and our ongoing continuous cost improvement initiatives will also contribute to the attainment of our annual savings target of $200 million. Only a modest amount of these savings are expected to impact the results of our March quarter. In fact, we expect operating expenses to increase sequentially as we incur new calendar year driven costs such as certain payroll tax and 401K matching contributions. ", "GAAP net income was $114 million for the December 2006 quarter. Non-GAAP net income equaled $248 million. Symantec exited December with a cash and short-term investments balance of almost $3 billion. ", "Earlier this month we completed our previously announced plans to repurchase $2.5 billion worth of our shares. In summary, we purchased a total of 142 million shares at an average share price of $17.59. As John mentioned, today we also announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion worth of our shares. Our net accounts receivable balance at the end of December 2006 quarter was $743 million. Days sales outstanding or DSO was 51 days, in line with normal seasonal trends for the business. ", "Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter is expected to be between $430 million and $440 million. This is lower than cash flow from operations of $521 million in the December 2005 quarter, primarily due to a one-time tax refund received in the December 2005 quarter related to a prior year Veritas tax return. ", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the December 2006 quarter was $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the quarter reached a record $2.49 billion and grew $500 million or almost 25% as compared to the December 2005 quarter and grew $238 million versus September 2006. Foreign currency had a positive impact of approximately $36 million on the September deferred revenue balance. We expect about 61% or approximately $770 million of our March quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet. ", "Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance. In summary, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided on Tuesday, January 16. Given the current business environment and exchange rate of $1.27 per Euro, our forecast for the March quarter and FY07 are as follows: GAAP March revenue is estimated between $1.24 billion and $1.27 billion. Non-GAAP revenue is estimated between $1.25 billion and $1.28 billion. GAAP earnings per share are forecasted between $0.04 and $0.06. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated between $0.18 and $0.20. We expect fully diluted common stock equivalents to be 965 million shares. ", "As I mentioned earlier, the impact of the cost savings initiatives that we outlined today is expected to be modest in the March quarter and has been taken into account in the guidance we are reaffirming today. It is possible, however, that there will be a restructuring charge related to the cost savings efforts that could affect GAAP earnings for the March quarter. ", "For the full year we are continuing to forecast GAAP revenue of between $5.08 billion and $5.11 billion. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance is expected to be between $5.13 billion and $5.16 billion. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.36 and $0.39. Non-GAAP earnings per share continue to be projected between $0.92 and $0.95. We expect fully diluted common stock equivalents for fiscal year 2007 to be 991 million shares. ", "We are reaffirming non-GAAP deferred revenue for FY07. Specifically, we expect deferred revenue to be in the range of $2.60 billion to $2.65 billion. Lastly, we expect cash flow from operations to be of the order of $1.5 billion. ", "With that, I'll hand the call back to Helen. ", " Helen Corcos", " Thank you, James. Tom, will you begin polling for questions? (Operator Instructions) While Tom is polling for questions I will like to announce that Symantec plans to attend the following upcoming conferences: Thomas Weisel Partners on February 6, Goldman Sachs on February 28, and Morgan Stanley on March 5. For a complete list of our investor-related events, please visit our event calendar on the Investor Relations website. Tom we are ready for our first question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " Our first question today comes from Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank. ", " Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "John, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more insight on the consumer business. Very nice acceleration of 19% growth here. What are your expectations here as we move into March, any impact expected from 360 as that begins to hit the market. Also, you mentioned OEM royalties as potentially having a negative impact on gross margin. Could you give us more insight into what's driving that? ", " John Thompson", " First off, the impact of Norton 360 in the March quarter will be minuscule. As I said in my planned comments, we don't expect it to ship until March, probably near the end of March and therefore it won't have much affect, if any at all, on the quarter's results. ", "We think the business is very solid and it's on the strength of just a tremendous job both the engineering team as well as the sales and marketing teams have done around the world. This '07 is a far superior product to anything that we have ever delivered. We think that's reflected in the uptick we saw in the December quarter and hopefully that will continue through March. ", "On the OEM royalty front, as the importance of security becomes more apparent to consumers, and it becomes even more apparent to our OEM partners, they would like a larger share of the revenue that is generated by us and others on their platforms. Because that is an important source of new customer capture, we think we have to continue to play in that space and hence we will have to adjust our expectations around gross margin yields in order to have the opportunity to capture new customers through the OEM channel. ", " Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", " Has there been a renegotiation within the HP relationship or can you update us as to the status there? ", " John Thompson", " Our relationship with HP is very, very solid. Very solid. I will just leave it at that. ", " Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Again on the 360 side, I guess my question was further out. Do you think it potentially changes the growth trajectory of the consumers business as you look beyond the March quarter? ", " John Thompson", " I think it has the potential to do that, Todd, because it will be a higher-priced product than the Norton Internet Security product. So as customers make the choice at renewal time or at point of purchase to buy Norton 360 versus NIS, we certainly should expect to get the price yield that's associated with the differential between the two products. ", "Now that being said, we also recognize that it takes a long time for our current base of users to migrate to the latest technology suite that we deliver. That was the case as people migrated from NAV to NIS and while we would hope that would accelerate NIS to Norton 360, our planning assumptions are not based on that. ", "Operator", " Ladies and gentlemen, just because we would like to get everybody's questions answered today, if you would just limit yourself to one question and one follow-up we would appreciate it. We will go next with Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs. ", " Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon, guys. James, a question on the cost side. To understand a little better, can you give us a sense of how much was extraordinary in the quarter? It is more as you project forward into the March guidance, if we look at where we were before on cost based on your prior guidance and then where we have to go today to get to your current guidance for March, I almost have to add new cost into the OpEx line. I would assume, if anything, you would be cutting back. Could you give us more clarity there? ", " James Beer", "Certainly, Sarah. The changes that I articulated a little earlier will really have a very modest impact in the March quarter itself, just given the timing of movements and so forth. So we will expect to see increased OpEx numbers in the March quarter versus the December quarter as a result of, in essence, the new calendar year starting off, additional payroll-related contributions, those that I mentioned in the call notes. But also, obviously during the December quarter we were very much on track with our OpEx plan generally towards that $3 billion figure, and so part of that plan was to hire some folks. We will see the carry through of those people coming on board during the March quarter as well. ", " Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "As a follow-up on your cost reduction, not much impact in March, but then how quickly would you hope you have that $200 million of savings done by? ", " James Beer", " Well, we are obviously still very much going through our detailed planning for FY08, and as we evolve our thinking on the cost side we are continuing that work. So once we have that completed, we will certainly look forward to giving you our sense for how the first quarter of the fiscal year '08 will look. ", " Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "But do you expect that you will do this quickly -- like a short, sharp shock -- or is this something that will take a full year to enact? ", " James Beer", " I think there will be different timelines associated with different elements of the program, if you will. One of the things that I referred to was the fact that we have identified and in place business process reengineering teams that will continue their work as the next few quarters unfold, to identify better ways for us to do business day-to-day consistent with the new scale of the organization. I think that would be an example of benefits that would flow into our P&L over time. ", "At the other end of the spectrum, obviously we have effectively frozen new hiring. That had already been done a little while back. So the benefit of that obviously would start to flow in more swiftly. So it will be a balance. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Adam Holt - JP Morgan. ", " Adam Holt - JP Morgan", " I apologize, James I'll just ask one more question on the expenses. Understanding you are still doing your planning and working through the numbers, would you expect that a high level for OpEx to be up, flat or down next fiscal year? ", " James Beer", " Well, a little early to give you too much of a sense for that, Adam. But obviously I think we have come out today with a pretty clear statement of intent in terms of the $200 million goal. That gives us a lot of work ahead of us and we were very serious about getting on with it as quickly as we can. ", " Adam Holt - JP Morgan", "If I could shift gears for a minute back to the revenue side, John, maybe a question for you on some of the changing mechanics around the Veritas business. You noted a couple of trends that are impacting that business, or at least did in the December quarter. A change in the payment terms, more multi-year contracts. As you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, do you see the growth trajectory of that business changing materially? Or do you just have to work through a cycle of some of these longer-term contracts that began to anniversary, maybe a year from now? ", " John Thompson", " That's a great question. I think this is a business model shift for a component, major component of the Veritas business where historically there had been a much more tight focus on new license sales and short-term maintenance effect that was motivated by the compensation plan. We are much more focused on building a long-term relationship with customers and locking in, if you will, a payment stream over a longer period of time and then using that as a base to sell new technologies and new products that we would introduce in our portfolio. ", "So I don't expect that the data center management group is going to have a huge uptick in revenue growth any time soon. I think what's going on is a natural recalibration as we look at the compensation models as well as the selling elements, if you will, that we have given our sales force to use. ", " Adam Holt - JP Morgan", " If you look at what was unique around the December quarter, obviously this snuck up on us a little bit. Is it just the fact that it was such a high period of renewals that you saw all of a sudden or this is something that's been happening slowly over a couple quarters and all of a sudden it was magnified by the percentage of renewals? ", " John Thompson", " That's exactly the point, Adam. I think when we look back now over the last three quarters we beat our forecast, our internal forecast, quite handsomely in the June quarter. We barely met the low end of our guidance in the September quarter and as we look now at September quarter, we can start to see the early signs of a problem that got amplified or magnified yet again in the December quarter. ", "The December quarter is a historically high quarter for renewals in that particular segment of our business and when we came into the quarter, we had different yield expectations based upon a year ago data. By the way, that wasn't the case this year. ", "So it will take us, as I said in my planned remarks, probably two or three quarters to work this through the system and then we will get on a more steady state run rate from a both licensed bookings as well as maintenance billings perspective. ", "It's a very solid business and we need to manage it for what revenue it will produce, but more importantly what cash and earnings it can produce. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Heather Bellini - UBS. ", " Heather Bellini - UBS", "Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an idea how much of the shortfall was related to the revenue recognition that you commented on? Then I guess going back to Sarah's question, could you give us a little bit more clarity because you run the risk of having people assume you will have $200 million in costs taken out of your P&L in fiscal year '08. Could you give us a sense of what you feel comfortable saying you will be able to take out by June? Give us some clarity how you would like us to model this? ", " James Beer", "To the first question, I would say the majority of the revenue surprise was driven by the recognition items that John was -- ", " Heather Bellini - UBS", " On the Veritas side? ", " James Beer", " Yes. As to the cost picture, I hope I have been clear in saying that there will be a very modest impact in the March quarter and that impact was already taken into account when we put out our guidance last Tuesday. ", " Heather Bellini - UBS", " Right, that's understood. ", " James Beer", " So hopefully there is no confusion on that. Obviously we will work to provide you with FY '08 first quarter guidance as swiftly as we can, but we have to complete our work to be able to do that in a sensible fashion. ", " Heather Bellini - UBS", " Can I ask you a follow-up then in regard to the cost cutting, the head count reductions that you mentioned. Are those going to be faster then? Do you have a sense when those would be initiated? ", " John Thompson", "Heather, I think it's best for us to announce issues like that to our people first as opposed to in an earnings call with important constituencies, but clearly our employees deserve to hear it first. ", " Heather Bellini - UBS", " Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Walsh - Citigroup. ", " John Walsh - Citigroup", "Good afternoon, guys. If we look back at the headcount additions over the last several quarters, headcount is up about 10%. As we talk about the cost side that you already articulated, I'm trying to match that up with maybe some high level view of where do you think revenue can grow by next year on this bigger base of customers? Again, the fact that you bulked up the overall employee base, which I assume a lot of it flowed into the distribution and sales channel. ", " James Beer", "Well, certainly trying to project the revenue for fiscal '08, again, very tough to do that given than we haven't gotten through our planning cycle yet. So I am afraid I will have to defer any specifics there. ", "Obviously we are pleased that we have been able to very successfully integrate our sales force and that is very much evidenced, I would argue, in the large deals statistics that we have articulated. Indeed, we have seen a very reasonable expected level of attrition and we have been able to add some very important resources to the sales function. I certainly feel that we have a sales force that is very well-positioned for the future. I think it will be a little premature for us to comment on specific revenue projections for fiscal '08, particularly given what we have seen in this December quarter and obviously we have spent a lot of time sorting through that in recent days and weeks. We will be applying that knowledge to our projections that will be able to offer with you shortly. ", " John Walsh - Citigroup", " Just to follow-up under this deferred revenue, if you look at the deferred revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of what is due to these new contract arrangements that you talked about upfront versus the normal buildup, especially from the consumer side? Maybe a breakout between the consumer and non-consumer side contribution. ", " James Beer", " What I say is that on the consumer side, because we have now lapped the year point in terms of the change to the ratable recognition model, we have now built up what you might call a steady state amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet. So now going forward you would expect that volume of deferred revenue to grow somewhat consistently with the organic growth rate of the business. ", "So I don't think you should expect large increases in deferred revenue as we have seen during the last three quarters or so while that buildup on the balance sheet was occurring. The strong buildup of deferred in the December quarter very much driven by the enterprise side of our business. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Philip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities. ", " Philip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", " Great. Thanks very much. You gave us a little bit of an update on Norton 360. Can you also at least give us some perspective on Hamlet? Is that on schedule as you had outlined in the past? Will there be a beta? Given that it is not, compared to Norton 360 with its ratable model, when that does hit the market would we expect more of an initial revenue spike or will that also be something that plays itself out throughout 2008? ", " John Thompson", " First off, Hamlet is doing very, very well. I just reviewed today some feedback from a customer who is trying it in a pre-beta experience. Given the feedback there, I'm quite encouraged. So it is still on schedule. It is due to be cut to the marketplace or released to the marketplace mid-year. Now, this is an enterprise-class product. So it will follow the normal enterprise licensing conventions that we have had for all of our end point security technologies. Many of our customers signed contracts that give them the right to upgrade to the new release and some of them will offer or choose to take new features in Hamlet at an incremental cost and that could boost new license sales. Think about this more in the context of a normal enterprise license agreement, not the consumer ratable revenue model. ", " Philip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", " Okay. But there will be new features that would be not included, I would assume, in some existing enterprise maintenance contracts, though. It sounds like some of them will just be typical upgrades? ", " John Thompson", " Exactly. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse. ", " Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi, guys. Just a couple quick questions. For the December quarter where did license revenue actually end up coming in at? When you all do look to the March quarter here, obviously you had a big variance in data center management. When you think about the March quarter and sequential growth rates here, what are you baking into this guidance on the top line? ", " James Beer", " Well, we don't have the specific answers to those questions that we can share with you. So I would say generally with the data center management group as we think about this coming quarter we are not expecting any significant reversal of the theme that we saw in the December quarter. So I think that's consistent with what John was talking about with regards to one of the earlier questions. ", " Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "On the license side of this quarter, any sense there up down, sequentially et cetera? ", " James Beer", " Again, we are not going to get into the specifics in that regard, but clearly there was a focus during the quarter on the enterprise side on the maintenance side of the ledger and that was a big part of what saw the deferred side of our revenue picture increasing very nicely and not having the recognized revenue come through in the manner with which we expected. ", " John Thompson", " I think, Phil, in the main we would have to acknowledge that we have to get a little better balance between new license and maintenance renewals. Certainly better balance than we saw in the December quarter. Tom and the geographic leaders certainly understand that and are appropriately focused. ", " Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Along those lines, how do you compensate for a license sale versus a one-year maintenance sale versus a multi-year? ", " John Thompson", " It's too complex to explain here. Suffice it to say, our sales teams are given an opportunity-based quota at the beginning of the year. So it reflects the full value of what we think the revenue yield can be out of a given account. They have a relative compensation plan based upon that opportunity. That would be the most general statement to make about it. Then there are all kinds of ups and downs and what have you. Generally it's opportunity-based and it is a relative compensation plan. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question with Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets. ", " Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the enterprise business on the security side, knowing that the data center management is under challenges, what kind of catalyst do you see to grow that business? Is it a combination of bringing in some of the recent acquisitions, getting into more deals? What do you see as driving the revenue growth? ", " John Thompson", " On the security and data management side, that business quite frankly had a very solid quarter. It is much more stable now with its sea legs under it compared to where it was let's say two or three quarters ago. There are areas of that particular business that are very promising, compliance which is a combination of what we do around the old ESM product and our BindView acquisition. Very, very strong quarter. Our End Point solutions, particularly those around End Point Access Control. That is a portion of the Sygate technology and it will be rolled into Hamlet which I discussed a little bit earlier. ", "Our enterprise Vault solution is doing very, very well. Continues to be the market-leading solution for helping customers manage their mail environment and we have expanded that to include a broader range of capabilities. Underneath all of this, what we got are a couple very large businesses around backup and enterprise AV that are large and have much, much lower growth rates. What we have to do is look to funnel our investment both sales, marketing and engineering more into products that we have in our portfolio that have inherently higher growth rates to see if we can't offset, if you will, some of the decline or mitigate some the decline, associated with the more mature product areas. ", " Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", " Just to follow-up, you talked about Bright Mail and we saw Cisco buy Iron Port; are there any other changes that you are picking up there from the competitive perspective on maybe some of the newer products? ", " John Thompson", " I think everyone sees the whole compliance arena as the high growth area. There is no competitor in the security space or quite frankly in the systems management space that hasn't cloaked themselves in the compliance mantra. We were fortunate that we are not only cloaked, we are cloaked with great products as well. So we think that's an area of terrific opportunity. Cisco is not there but the likes of IBM clearly are. We don't lack for competitors in the market. ", " Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", " Thank you. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch. ", " Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. In looking at the change of business model that has resulted in a lower yield in the data center management, is there any probability that we might see the same type of phenomenon play out in the security and data management segment? ", " John Thompson", " We don't anticipate that because that business doesn't have the same dynamics, if you will, in terms of the way transactions have historically been booked or are currently being booked with customers. So it's not assumed in any of our forecasting at this point in time. ", " Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", " Okay. Just a follow-up on the data center management group. Were there any products or can you provide any granularity in terms of where there may have been a greater than expected change in yield? ", " John Thompson", " Well, suffice it to say, it was across the board. While we don't provide product level detail in this particular instance, I can say there wasn't a product that was hot and one that was not. It was an across the board decline, if you will. ", "Operator", " We have our next question from Kathleen Egbert with Jefferies & Co. ", " Kathleen Egbert - Jefferies", " Hi, good afternoon. A quick question on your capital structure. As you look to another borrowing to finance a buy back, what level of debt are you comfortable bringing on? ", " James Beer", " We have announced another buyback this afternoon, but our cash position is strong, as you see in our financials. So I would be expecting to buy those shares back out of the cash proceeds of the company. ", " Kathleen Egbert - Jefferies", "Fair enough. Did I hear you right when you said that EMEA was down 4% if you exclude the currency impact? ", " James Beer", " Yes I think that is right, 4%. Yes. ", " Kathleen Egbert - Jefferies", " Can you explain what went on there? Give us a little more detail about the issues you had in September, how quickly you are going to resolve those? ", " John Thompson", "Actually, Europe performed better than our expectations in the December quarter. Now, you might conclude from that that our expectations were modest. But we are still working our way through the issues in the central region which is predominantly Germany. It continues to be a challenge for our team, but we have not only a focused leader sitting on top of all of EMEA, we have a new leader in the central region and he is on board and working his way through the issues. ", "We think it will take year to work our way through the issues in the central region and we are one quarter into it, so we probably have three more quarters to go. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey. ", " Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", " Just being a veteran and seeing a lot of cycles, how does '07 look when you talk to customers in regard to just general spending trends, enthusiasm as compared with '06? Not just Symantec-specific, but just in regard to spending patterns and judging it relative to previous cycles? ", " John Thompson", " I think corporate profits are strong. Therefore, I think investments will continue to be made in productivity enhancing technologies. I think on the IT side many, many of the CIOs I talk to are very much focused on, how do I take complexity and cost out of my data center? So the things that we were doing around data center consolidation and data center standardization should certainly help them. ", "The compliance problem is real. They have IT general controls concerns that have certainly surfaced through SarbOx and other compliance initiatives. There is going to continue to be strong spending on both software and services around that particular paradigm. ", "So I think in general the '07 environment will be as strong as it was in \u201806 or as solid as it was in '06 and I think that should bode well for our company as we get our sea legs under us for all of the activity we have undertaken over the last 12 months to bring the two companies together. ", " Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "A lot of people are talking about mobile device security, protecting data leakage, however you want to characterize it. What you think of that technology in regards to where it is in the cycle, and are a lot of customers talking about mobile device security? ", " John Thompson", "I think data leakage is a slightly different problem than mobile device security. While they manifest themselves perhaps similarly, that is the device happens to be the source of the leak. But you can deliver data leakage technologies in many instances without touching the end point or the mobile device. ", "I think mobile device security in and of itself long term, represents a big opportunity for the industry. The question I think is when does the real opportunity show up? And I'm not convinced it is next week or this year. I think it's a bit further out than that, because I think there are other problems that customers are trying to solve around data management and data security beyond just mobile devices. ", " Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", " So this doesn't seem like necessarily a near term sort of spending surge? It seems maybe long-term/near-term enthusiasm was kind of overstated? ", " John Thompson", " It would be my view that it's two to three years out. Not something that's going to happen in significant terms in FY '07 or calendar '07. ", "Operator", " We will take our next question from Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners. ", " Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel ", " First question has to do with the deferred revenues. You mentioned you are selling more of the Veritas products, will be going into the deferred line, but you mentioned that you may be quick promoting the three-year term contracts or multi-year contracts into the consumer. Will the second piece be negligible, or will there be a piece that will offset the Veritas build? ", " James Beer", " I would say that in the December results that we just announced the expected reduction in multi-year consumer sales has already been taken into account. ", " Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel ", "Very good. Going on to the security and data management, it seems like obviously your archiving and compliance are doing well out there. Is that helping to firm up the pricing on the enterprise AV side as you can begin to offer more attractive bundles? ", " John Thompson", " Well, there are certainly instances where when we can go in and sell a more complete solution and I would characterize that as our front end scanning technologies with our back end indexing technologies, plus services. We can have a deeper, more highly valued relationship with the customer. But to be clear, enterprise AV or End Point security is a fairly stable pricing market at this point in time. I'm not convinced that you get leverage through tying it to something on the back end. I think you get leveraged through implementation of unique new technologies at the end point itself. ", "So things like Sonar which I talked about on the call or our end point compliance solutions, those are the ones that are likely to give us the opportunity for some higher yield per end point as we move forward. ", " Helen Corcos", " Tom, we have time for one more question. ", "Operator", "All right, and that question comes from Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray. ", " Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", " Good afternoon. If you can talk about the Dell opportunity, maybe a \u2018State of the Union\u2019 of what's going on with Dell? I haven't heard much on that front. ", "Second is, you talked about the overall growth in consumer at least on the deferral side is going to be tracking to organic growth. Was the organic growth 19% year over year last quarter? Just to clarify that. ", " John Thompson", " Well, the organic growth for the consumer business in the December quarter, adjusted for the ratable model, was 19%. So that is off the charts kind of performance for that business and it's consistent with seasonal trends. So the consumer business will tend to have its strongest growth in the December quarter and perhaps its weakest performance in June quarter. That is the historical trend. ", "With respect to Dell, Dell continues to be a very important partner of ours both on the enterprise side, as well as on the consumer side. We did have a nice position with Dell during the December quarter where we were on the default option, if you will, for the configuration for the Dell products. We continue to work with Dell to make sure that we have an opportunity to sell licenses through the Dell channel. We also want to make sure that we can enhance our relationship with them on the enterprise side. ", "That's where we think there may be a bigger opportunity that is perhaps a little less price sensitive. They build our mail security product. We have a bundled solution there that we are co-marketing together in the marketplace and we think there are other opportunities like that for us as we move forward. ", " Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", " I guess one quick follow-up. Norton 360, do you think that will be within the consumer configuration window with Dell? ", " John Thompson", " Well we are certainly talking to them about it. But as you well know, our relationship with any OEM provider or manufacturer is not just solely based upon the quality and innovation in our products, but it is the economics associated with the relationship that we can build with them. While we think we have market-leading products, we want to get market-leading economics as well. ", "Operator", " Mr. Thompson, that does conclude our Q&A session. I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks. ", " John Thompson", " Thank you very much for taking the time to be with us this afternoon. Clearly the December quarter was a huge disappointment to us, but we think many of the one-time actions associated with our process and systems changes are behind us. We think we have recalibrated our revenue and cost expectations to be more consistent with what the reality is of our business at this point in time. As always, it's now about us executing, more than ever before. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", " This does conclude today's conference call.

Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results which can be found in the press release and on our website. ", "Now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. John Thompson. ", "John Thompson - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Helen. Symantec ended FY2007 with a solid March quarter. Our performance represents a combination of strong demand for our products and services and a much improved operational focus to optimize revenue yield. As a result, a greater proportion of the largest contracts signed by customers included terms and conditions that drove higher end-period revenue. The performance included solid results in a number of our key enterprise product areas, including Net Backup, Storage Foundation, Email Messaging, IT Compliance and Services, as well as another great quarter for our market-leading consumer suite, Norton Internet Security. ", "In addition to better than expected revenue and EPS results, we are pleased with the growth of our deferred revenue and our strong cash flow generation during the March quarter. We continue to believe these are two important metrics to consider in evaluating the strength of our underlying business. The breadth of our security availability and services solutions continues to drive the number of large transactions for Symantec. In the March quarter, we generated a total of 376 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, compared to 384 in the March quarter of 2006 and 99 deals worth more than $1 million each compared to 91 in the March quarter of 2006. ", "In addition, 77% of the large transactions included multiple products or services, which underscores the success of our solution selling approach. During the quarter, we signed a multimillion-dollar, multi-year extension of a federal government contract which included a variety of our market\u2013leading solutions, including anti-virus, anti-spam, endpoint compliance, policy compliance, storage, backup and message management as well as business critical services offerings. ", "Other large, multimillion-dollar customer wins included a large US telco for Storage Foundation, NetBackup, Cluster Server and Enterprise Vault and a global financial institution for Storage Foundation, NetBackup and Enterprise Security Manager. The market trend of customers interested in doing business with fewer vendors is becoming more evident every quarter in our results. In our global scale, our deep product portfolio is central to their decision and purchase process. ", "The March quarter was a strong finish to what was unquestionable a challenging year. Fiscal 2007 was a transition year for Symantec, marked by the implementation of several major but necessary changes in our operations as we continued to evolve our business. One of the most significant changes was implemented on the first day for FY2007, when we integrated our enterprise sales force. We aligned our model to a more typical industry approach of having a single account manager supported by individual product or solution specialists. We are pleased with the structure as it allows for better account and opportunity coverage while leveraging our broad product portfolio. ", "We also undertook a major business process and systems consolidation project. Project Oasis integrated our two ERP systems into a single enhanced system, allowing us to implement new buying programs, drive operational efficiencies and create a platform to improve the ease of transacting business with our customers and partners. This project is important because it provides the foundation for scaling our business and lowering our costs over time. We believe many of the major challenges we faced are now behind us and our efforts are now directed towards the continuous improvement process so essential for business of our scale. ", "We also undertook action to better align our operating expenses with our revenue expectations and implemented several initiatives that we believe will result in annualized savings of at least $200 million. James will outline our progress in this area in a few minutes. Also last June, we took a series of actions to optimize our capital structure with the issuance of a $2.1 billion convertible subordinated note. In addition, during FY2007, we repurchased a total of $2.8 billion of our common stock. Finally we fortified out strength at the end point with the addition of Altiris. ", "Our customers know that they cannot have true endpoint security without the configuration management and software distribution capabilities so necessary to protect them. We believe a combination of Symantec and Altiris will enable our customers to better manage and enforce security policies at the endpoint, identify and protect against threats, as well as remediate and manage their IT assets. We were pleased with how swiftly we were able to close the transaction and with the progress we have made towards integrating Altiris into Symantec. While we are not providing specific financial details about the Altiris quarter, it did perform solidly and well within the range of our expectations. ", "At the beginning of the new fiscal year, I reorganized the senior leadership structure. We have a strong leadership team and the goal of these changes was to ensure that every executive has the necessary cross-functional experience to better position the company for long-term success. Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the highlights of our business unit\u2019s performance during the March quarter. ", "We are pleased with the data center management group\u2019s March quarter performance and with the sequential improvement in revenue. We saw strength primarily in our Storage Foundation solutions and NetBackup product family. Results were driven by customers\u2019 desire to standardize and simplify their data center infrastructure. The complexity of enterprise IT environments is making it exceedingly difficult for organizations to keep up with the growing performance and availability demands for key applications while at the same time keeping costs under control. ", "Earlier this year we introduced a customized ROI tool that clearly demonstrates how our solutions can improve the performance and availability of data centers as well as drive dramatic direct cost improvements \u2013 in several cases, well over $100 million over a three years period. While our data center standardization and ROI program was primarily focused on storage foundation and clustering areas, we have now expanded this approach to include NetBackup as well. An example of our success in this area is the opportunity we won with Sun Microsystems during the March quarter. Sun displaced a Symantec competitor in order to standardize on Net Backup throughout its enterprise. Sun will use Net Backup and Backup Reporter to streamline its IT operations and provide better data protection reporting. ", "Overall, we feel confident that standardization and the growing adoption of new data protection, storage and server management technologies will help drive revenue growth in this segment during FY2008. Our security and data management group posted in-line results with our expectations. We continue to see solid growth in the emerging product areas where we are investing, such as compliance solutions and enterprise message management. For example, we achieved record results in our buying view and enterprise security manager compliance products. Companies face increasing challenges with IT compliance, especially in highly regulated industries. These products help our customers manage their internal as well as external regulatory compliance requirements and reduce the growing costs of doing so. ", "We also achieved record revenue with our message management offerings, with strong growth coming from our anti-spam products and enterprise vault, our email archiving and retrieval solution. These two products categories are leaders and we continue to gain traction in the marketplace with them. Many of these represent technologies we acquired over the past few years. Our technology and company acquisitions are an important part of our strategy to diversify our revenue mix in the security arena towards segments of higher growth. Most of you are familiar with project Hamlet. Hamlet will integrate technology components from our leading anti-virus, anti-spam, endpoint firewall, zero day protection and network access compliance offerings, all to be managed by a single management platform. ", "The solution will not only deliver a more advanced approach to endpoint protection, but address the all important issue for our customers of agent proliferation and systems resource consumption. We plan to launch the product at our vision conference net month. Given the phenomenal success we experienced with Norton 360\u2019s extended beta program, we decided to expand the scope of the Hamlet beta program prior to full-scale release of such an important product. Like Norton 360, this will ensure a higher quality release for a very, very important product launch. ", "Our services group performed solidly during the March quarter. Our focus on helping customers manage IT risk to their infrastructure is really starting to gain traction. With more than 1,100 consultants around the world, we have the skills to deliver more complete solutions for protecting and managing business critical assets. We are also happy with the launch of our beta of the Symantec Protection Network, our first software as a service offering. The Protection Network is a SaaS platform designed to deliver easy-to-use security and availability offerings to small and mid sized companies. The online backup service will enable cost-effective, reliable backup and restoration of business critical data from the convenience of a web browser. ", "We expect this new service go live later this year and you should expect to see us announce additional SaaS offerings throughout FY2008. Our consumer business posted another strong quarter, while the online threat landscape and competitive environment continue to evolve, there has been one constant. Symantec\u2019s Norton products are the clear market leader. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the launch of Norton 360, as the industry and market reaction have been very positive. Our continued focus on technology leadership and product quality has clearly shown through in many of the published reviews on Norton 360. It has already garnered the prestigious Editor\u2019s Choice Awards for both CNET and PC Magazine. ", "The OEM channel continues to be an important route to market for our consumer products. During the quarter, we announced the extension of our relationship with HP with a new multiyear agreement. We also announced that ACER will be shipping a Vista-compatible version of Norton Internet Security in 2007 and at Dell, Symantec will be positioned as the default solution in North America from May through July. All in all, it was a very solid March quarter to cap off a challenging fiscal year. I believe we have taken the necessary steps to improve our global operations and our results in FY2008 will benefit from these actions. After James provides you details on our financials, I\u2019ll come back and talk about our specific focus areas for FY2008. ", "James? ", "James Beer - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I am encouraged by the progress we have made as evidenced by the March quarter results. Over the past 12 months, a lot of change impacted our operations and financial performance as John mentioned in his opening remarks. Although we have faced challenges, I believe we have emerged stronger and better-positioned for future growth. We grew our fiscal year non-GAAP revenue by 5% to more than $5.25 billion, compared to the prior fiscal year, and generated $1.01 in non-GAAP EPS. ", "Given the recurring nature of our business model, deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are also important metrics in measuring the overall strength of our business. In fact, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.67 billion during FY2007. In addition, during the fiscal year, we grew non-GAAP deferred revenue to approximately $2.8 billion. Our financial results will benefit from this strong deferred revenue balance during FY2008. The contribution from our consumer business to deferred revenue growth is moderating, consistent with the now ratable revenue recognition policy, while the data center management group\u2019s contribution has grown in line with our business model evolution that emphasizes long-term customer relationships. ", "But before I get into the new fiscal year, I would like to spend a minute reviewing the financial details of the March 2007 quarter. GAAP revenue for our March 2007 quarter was $1.357 billion. Non-GAAP revenue grew 5% over the March 2006 period to $1.365 billion. Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP revenue by almost $48 million in the March 2007 quarter as compared to March 2006. Sequentially foreign currency movements had approximately a $9 million positive impact on revenue. The March quarter\u2019s fully diluted GAAP EPS were $0.07. Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS for the quarter were $0.24. During the March quarter, GAAP EPS were impacted by a $51 million restructuring charge, related to our recent reduction in force and further facilities consolidation activities. ", "International non-GAAP revenue for the March quarter grew 9% versus the year ago period to approximately $706 million and represented 52% of total non-GAAP revenue. YoverY, the Americas grew 3%, EMEA grew 7% and Asia Pacific including Japan grew 9%. Excluding currency effects, the EMEA revenue declined by 2% YoverY. Now I\u2019d like to move on to non-GAAP revenue by segment for the March 2007 quarter. ", "Consumer revenue came in at $408 million, up 11% versus the March 2006 quarter. Electronic distribution represented nearly 73% of consumer revenue and grew 25% compared to March 2006, driven primarily by strong activity from our online store subscription renewals and upgrades. From a product perspective, Norton Internet Security revenue grew nearly 40% YoverY and represents more than 50% of total consumer revenue. Moving on to our enterprise segments, our security and data management group generated revenue of $520 million, up 2% from the March 2006 quarter. ", "The data center management business generated revenue of $368 million. This was flat with the March 2006 results and up 8% sequentially. Our services group generated revenue of $69 million, up 31% YoverY and represented 5% of our total revenue. The services business was positively impacted by the reversal of one-time administrative challenges that occurred during the December quarter, as well as generated by our team of consultants from the recently acquired Company-i. ", "Non-GAAP gross margin was 84% for the March 2007 quarter, compared to 83.2% in December 2006. Gross margin was higher than expected sequentially because of a change in accounting for certain consumer OEM relationships. We have negotiated new contract terms with various OEM partners, which solidify our relationships for an extended period of time. The revised terms also drive an accounting change that has the effect of moving our OEM payments from cost of goods sold to operating expenses. Our total in-period expenses will increase, since they will now reflect the average economic cost of each relationship over the term of the agreement, rather than the cash impact to Symantec in a particular fiscal year. ", "Our segment reporting for the consumer business unit will reflect this change during FY2008. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $842 million for the March 2007 quarter. This includes approximately $55 million of expenses, incremental to our previous guidance, related to the OEM item I have just mentioned. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted operating expenses during the March quarter by approximately $23 million as compared to March 2006. GAAP net income was $61 million for the March 2007 quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $227 million compared to $279 million for the March 2006 quarter. ", "Symantec exited March with a cash and short-term investments balance of almost $3 billion. However, our current cash balance is considerably lower as a result of closing the Altiris acquisition on April 6, for an effective cost of $815 million. Approximately two thirds of our cash balance resides overseas. As you may recall, in January, we announced a new $1 billion share buyback program. During the March quarter, we repurchased $500 million worth of the new program at an average share price of $17.41. Our net accounts receivable balance at the end of the March 2007 quarter was $667 million. DSO was 45 days, inline with normal seasonal trends. ", "Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter is expected to be between $560-570 million. This was higher than cash flow from operations of $484 million in the March 2006 quarter, primarily due to strong collections and to the timing of tax payments. As I already mentioned, we generated approximately $1.67 billion in cash flow from operations during FY2007. This was in line with our original guidance issued a year ago. ", "Consistent with the past several quarters, deferred revenue increased substantially as we continue to move our business model to one that generates significant recurring maintenance activity and thus more predictable cash flow. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the March 2007 quarter was approximately $2.75 billion. Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the March 2007 quarter reached a record $2.77 billion. Sequentially, deferred revenue grew $187 million or 7%. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately $105 million versus the balance as of March 2006, and the $19 million benefit versus the December 2006 balance. ", "By year end, deferred revenue balance exceeded the high end of our guided range of $2.65 billion as provided in January. Now I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance. Our FY2008 plan has revenue and earnings growing at a faster pace than FY2007. Specifically, we expect GAAP revenue for the fiscal year to be between $5.59-5.69 billion. Non-GAAP revenue is expected to be $5.65-5.75 billion as compared to $5.253 billion in FY2007. This includes the revenue contribution from the Altiris acquisition on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting the impact of deferred revenue lost due to the purchase accounting method associated with acquisitions. ", "During FY08, gross margins will come under some pressure as we continue to grow our services businesses, while the change in accounting for our consumer OEM fees will have the opposite effect. We expect the net result to be an improvement in gross margins YoverY. Our operating expenses during the year will benefit from the results of our cost savings initiative. We have clearly defined budgets in place that will achieve the $200 million annualized savings target during FY2008. The largest element of this plan is represented by an approximate 5% reduction in force. ", "This has been completed in the Americas and Asia while the EMEA region implementation is underway. The addition of the OEM fees to our operating expense base will create a situation in which totally operating expenses increase substantially YoverY. That said, we do believe that operating margins will improve during FY2008 as compared to FY2007, as a result of our revenue growth, the expansion of our growth margins and the benefits of our cost reduction program. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.45-0.50. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.15 as compared to $1.01 in FY2007. ", "This guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the year of approximately 925 million shares. We have assumed an exchange rate of $1.27 per euro for the fiscal year. Continuing in the trend seen throughout FY2007, we expect FY2008 to be another year in which deferred revenue growth outpaces our recognized revenue growth, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. We would expect annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to grow versus fiscal year 2007 levels. Our strong cash flow generation will underpin our ongoing share buyback activity which will, in turn, support improvements in our EPS growth. ", "We expect revenue during the first half of the fiscal year to represent approximately 45% of the non-GAAP FY2008 revenue forecast. Diluted EPS during the first half of the fiscal year are expected to represent approximately 35% of the non-GAAP FY2008 EPS forecast. For the June 2007 quarter, we expect our core business to exhibit similar seasonal patterns to those we have seen in prior years. We typically experience a sequential decline in revenue earnings and deferred revenue from the March to June quarter. This year, the impact of the Altiris acquisition will grow our revenue base while the accounting for our new OEM agreements will put additional pressure on EPS. ", "As such, our guidance for the June 2007 quarter is as follows: GAAP revenue is estimated to be in the range of $1.275-1.305 billion. Non-GAAP revenue is estimated to be in the range of $1.295-1.325 billion, as compared to $1.288 billion in June 2006. GAAP EPS are forecasted to be in the range of $0.00-0.02. Non-GAAP EPS are estimated to be in the range of $0.18-0.20, as compared to $0.24 in June 2006. For the June quarter, we expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.71-2.75 billion. ", "We expect non-GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.75-2.79 billion, as compared to $2.34 billion in June 2006. During the June quarter, we expect about $840 million of our deferred revenue will convert into recognized revenue. This is approximately 10% higher than the equivalent figure from the March quarter, continuing to illustrate how our business model is now generating increased volumes of predictable recognized revenue. We expect cash flow from operations to exceed the June 2006 result of $368 million. ", "This guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of 920 million shares. We have assumed an exchange rate of $1.32 per euro for the June quarter. We plan to continue to work on our current $1 billion share repurchase program during the June quarter. FY2008 will also be a year in which we further evolve our capital structure in order to create a balance sheet that is consistent with the strong cash flow generation capability of Symantec. ", "Finally, in FY2008, our segment reporting will include the new Altiris business segment and our recently reorganized security, data management and services segments. To better align our business units with our go to market activities, all of our services-related offerings, including managed security services, Symantec security response and our new software as a service initiative will become part of the services business segment. These services have different margins and capital requirements than those of the software business that were previously included in the security and data management group. ", "We will provide you with a historical view of the new business segments on our next earnings announcement. We\u2019re enthusiastic about the competitiveness of our product set, the capabilities of our sales force and distribution partners and our focus on executing on our plans quarter by quarter. Now I\u2019d like to hand the call back to John. ", "John Thompson", "Thanks, James. We believe we have entered FY2008 with the most difficult part of our transformation behind us. More importantly, we are much better positioned to deliver our market-leading security and availability products to our customers and partners around the world. We are placing much greater emphasis on managing our diverse portfolio of products and striving for better balance between revenue grow, operating cost and margin expansion. ", "There are several areas of focus for FY2008 that should lead to better operating returns. Perhaps the most significant ones are stronger alignment between sales and marketing, tighter alignment between product delivery activities and our market readiness plans, increasing our internal operating efficiencies and continuing to realign our capital structure. ", "First, on sales force alignment we are satisfied with the structure implemented in 2007. As a result, we entered this fiscal year with our sales team better trained on the breadth of our product portfolio and our major marketing campaign initiatives. We will make slight modifications in the compensation model to ensure a better balance between growing our annuity revenue stream that drives strong cash flow growth and growing new license sales. We also intend to tighten the linkage between our marketing campaign actions and the key geographic sales activities around the world. ", "The October launch of our new, branded product marketing platform is a great starting point, particularly given the strong feedback we have received on overall aided and unaided recognition. Next, we intend to leverage a combination of the Hamlet product launch and the integration of Altiris as a significant proof point to the strength of our M&A strategy. Customers continue to tell us that they see value in operating with fewer vendors supporting their IT initiatives. They would like to see the real benefits of our integration actions. In the security and compliance arena, the combination of Altiris, a significant new endpoint security product, and in integrated compliance offering which combines the strength of ESM and BindView will be proof positive. ", "In the storage arena, a refresh of our market-leading offerings should strengthen our competitive position. Finally, our consumer team will focus its efforts on out-executing the competition, in both product initiatives as well as with our key channel partners. Next, with the implementation of Project Oasis behind us, we intend to shift our focus to areas that should yield improved operations effectiveness and overall company efficiencies. Many of the important customer and partner-facing activities associated with our quote to cash process will be the target of our re-engineering efforts. ", "We have teams in place and some of the work has already begun and is starting to bear fruit. Finally, we took our first step in FY2007 to move the company toward a capital structure more fitting a company with the strength of our cash flow generation. We clearly think more can be done and expect to make additional progress in that direction during this fiscal year. We will spend considerably more time on our plans in these areas at our analyst day event next month. With the tremendous number of changes implemented during FY2007, we are looking forward to FY2008 to be a year of greater stability and growth. ", "I believe Symantec is a much stronger company today, largely due to the broad portfolio of award-winning technologies and our diverse base of enterprise and individual customers around the world. More than ever, our customers and partners are looking to Symantec for IT risk management solutions across a broad spectrum of operating platforms and we look forward to delivering on those expectations. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Helen, so we can take some questions. ", "Helen Corcos", "Thank you, John. Alan, will you please begin polling for questions? ", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Operator instructions.", "Helen Corcos", "While Alan is polling for questions, I would like to announced that Symantec plans to attend the JP Morgan conference on 22 May. In addition, we will be hosting our annual analyst meeting on June 14 in Las Vegas. This event is by invitation only and registration is required. If you would like to take advantage of the special hotel rate for this event, we encourage you to register by this Friday, 4 May. A live webcast and replay of the event will be available on the investor relations homepage for those who cannot attend in person. ", "Lastly, starting now and on a going forward basis, we will announce our next quarterly earnings date on the current earnings call. As such, we will be reporting our Q1 FY2008 results on 25 July. This information will also be posted on our events calendar. For a complete list of the investor related events, please visit our events calendar on the investor relations website. Alan, we are ready for our first question. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our first question from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Nice to see the stability coming back. John, if I could ask you a question on the storage business, the data center business, as that was where we saw a lot of the weakness last quarter \u2013 you talked about refreshing the product set. Is that enough to get you back to a market growth rate of mid single digits? What are some of the key things we should watch for, other than just product refresh? ", "John Thompson", "Clearly, the team, both in the development lab as well as in the field, is executing very, very well. Last quarter\u2019s performance, that is the March quarter\u2019s performance, was a reflection of tighter focus on transactions as they work their way through the pipeline. I think that improved the yield, quite substantially, of revenue in the period. That being said, we are still going through a transition of that business where today more of the revenue goes through the balance sheet than the P&L. I think as we complete that transition, about mid year, this fiscal year, you\u2019ll start to see much improved performance in that business, independent of what we will do on the product front. ", "On the product front, we will launch a new Net Backup product, Net Backup 6.5, and we will always do more if you will in the storage management arena because that is an area of great investment by our customers and therefore we have to follow suit by making significant investments ourselves. I feel that the team has sharpened its end period market execution and the engineering team is moving a terrific set of products through the pipeline. I think that will bode well for us in this fiscal year. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "One quick follow up on that. Maybe it\u2019s the same question. Can you tell us what portion of total bookings are now ratable and what you think the steady state percentage might be, just to give us a sense of where we\u2019re moving from today to that mid-year stability point? ", "James Beer", "I mentioned in my remarks about the volume of business in the June quarter that we would expect to see coming straight off the balance sheet. We offered an absolute dollar statistic in this call, because we really wanted to emphasize the point as to how that absolute figure is rising quarter by quarter. I would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. I think the ratable percentage can climb some more. I would not expect it to trend towards 100% however, so I think there would be some incremental increase from where we are right now, but we are pretty comfortable with the general direction of the 60-70% range that we are in. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "I was just wondering, John, I noticed in the US that your results here showed that you guys grew 1% YoverY. I\u2019m just wondering if you could tell us what you are seeing from buyers in this market, the types of hesitations you\u2019re seeing, what you\u2019re factoring in for June and then also for James, I didn\u2019t believe I caught \u2013 and maybe you didn\u2019t disclose it \u2013 what you\u2019re expecting for an Altiris revenue contribution for FY2008? ", "John Thompson", "I think one of the things you have to factor in, Heather, about the US business in particular is it is the largest and strongest business for our data center management group. If you were to peel underneath that group\u2019s performance, what you\u2019ll find is a larger portion of the transactions occur in the Americas. More of that revenue is moving to the balance sheet than the P&L and hence, in the near term, the US business may look weaker than it actually is performing in true market-based activity. ", "I\u2019m not at all concerned about what\u2019s going on in the Americas. It is executing as we would expect, particularly related to the large deals that we see coming out of the data center management group product portfolio. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "So you\u2019re not seeing any weakness in terms of decision-makers pulling the trigger, it\u2019s more a function of it going to the balance sheet? ", "John Thompson", "That\u2019s exactly right. If you look at our large deal flow, we had more large deals above $1 million this quarter than we did a year ago, and while we had a slight downtick in deals above $300,000, that was not particularly alarming to me at all. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Great. Then just the question on the Altiris revenue contribution for FY2008? ", "James Beer", "We are not going to break out projections for FY2008 by business unit. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Since it\u2019s an acquisition, so people could get a sense for organic \u2013 I mean, is $200 million a decent ballpark figure for Altiris? That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting a lot of questions on. ", "James Beer", "I\u2019d rather not be frankly pressed on a particular figure. Obviously the segment reporting in our form K and form Qs as we go through the year will give you a very clear sense to how Altiris is doing. As John mentioned, we\u2019re very comfortable with where Q1 was. We think we\u2019ve got a very good series of opportunities in front of us. We\u2019re working hard on that. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "Could you talk a little bit about Norton 360? Obviously it\u2019s a whole new game changing platform for the consumer business, I\u2019m on backup of something that no one\u2019s really targeted \u2013 I guess just how the adoption has been? Any sort of metrics we can get our arms around for some more details on that? ", "John Thompson", "Gene, we were very, very pleased with Norton 360\u2019s performance in the quarter. As you may recall, it was released late in the quarter or near the end of the quarter, I think would be a better phrase. Its contribution from a revenue perspective is quite small, but its contribution to the deferred revenue bill was quite surprising and quite pleasing. ", "I think it would be fair to say that with over 1 million units shipped so far, it is the single most significant product release we have ever made in the company. The team just did a bang up job, both the engineering team as well as the marketing team. Our sales teams now around the world are really having a lot of fun with Norton 360 and that\u2019s evident in all of the positive press we\u2019ve got. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "Have you seen any consumers starting to pay up for more storage? How\u2019s the storage side of Norton 360 coming together? ", "John Thompson", "Gene, frankly I can\u2019t answer that \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve looked that closely. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "One more question, in terms of the earnings for Q1 being a little bit below what analyst expectations were \u2013 is there any shift in terms of timing of expenses that might have impacted that? ", "James Beer", "Certainly this OEM fee issue that I referred to a few times in my remarks will certainly impact the bottom line. I have the sense that it will incur about $0.015 at the bottom line. That is probably the single largest issue and again that is very much an accounting issue rather than en economic issue, based upon the fact that the accounting rules require us to utilize the average rate that applies over the multi-year deal over the current year economic rate. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "So there is no incremental initiatives that you are spending more money on in Q1, it is just more kind of shift in accounting? ", "James Beer", "In fact, in Q1, we will really see the full effects for the first time of the $200 million cost reduction activities. As I mentioned, the reduction in force is complete at this stage in the Americas and in Asia, so that will help us. ", "John Thompson", "Also, Gene, it\u2019s not clear to us that all the models reflect the typical seasonality of our business. As a matter of fact, we would view that the seasonality is not reflected in many of the consensus view models that are out there today. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard, Cowan & Co. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowan & Co", "I have a couple of questions, John. I know last quarter, meaning December, the ERP turned out to a be pretty big hindrance to the business. Any comment on where you are with that? Are we 100% through it, or is there still work to go there? ", "John Thompson", "Walter, I think we are beyond the critical stage where we are making continuous improvements in the systems environment. Clearly we saw improvements in the administrative processes around our services business, that is reflected in the March quarter results. Our licensing portal, which was one of the challenging areas, we have had a subsequent release of software to improve that. There is yet another one coming. As I said in my stated comments, we are in a process now of continuous improvement, because we think we have the right foundational architecture and products in place to support a business that wants the scale. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowan & Co", "James, is there any way you could quantify for us the impact \u2013 I believe your guidance does include the penalty of purchase accounting on the Altiris business \u2013 is there any way you could quantify for us how much deferred revenue you\u2019re having to write down from Altiris? ", "James Beer", "Altiris is a relatively small deferred revenue balance. There wasn\u2019t an enormous part of the acquisition. It was of the order of $40 million or so. We have reconciliations in the back of the press release that take you from GAAP to non-GAAP that include the Altiris issue. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now go to Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "If we step back and look holistically at the business, you have a data center business that was basically flat from a revenue perspective this year. The security business was up a little bit. Consumer continued to just be a phenomenal performer in double digits. Deferred revenue was very nice. If I try and step back and think organically what the growth profile of the various businesses look like and what we should be thinking about, you know, the overall ability of the business to grow YoverY, can you help us quantify it from a business perspective, segment by segment? ", "John Thompson", "It\u2019s not our intent, quite frankly Todd, to provide segment-level details or projections. We have given you a view of what we think the aggregate business can perform at and I think that is sufficient for now. I think what people perhaps do not spend as much time on as they should is while revenue growth is certainly one measure of our performance, and I would never want to lose a sharp eye on that. ", "I think the other two metrics that people should and must pay more attention to are what is going on in the deferred line and what\u2019s going on with cash flow in this company. The success of our sales efforts are measured not just in revenue growth alone but in free cash flow from operating activities and how we build the deferred revenue balance. Both of those last two metrics performed very, very well in FY2007, while we were a bit shy admittedly on the revenue and EPS side. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "I totally agree with that. If we look at deferred revenue, you mentioned the government transaction. They have a ton of products in the multi-year deal. Are we seeing contract length extent out, or can we look at deferred revenue and say growth should start accelerating at this type of level? How can we segregate out the annual organic growth in deferred revenue versus deal extension? ", "John Thompson", "Clearly on our balance sheet you can see current and long-term deferred revenue so you\u2019ll be able to see what is happening in the deferred revenue lines on those two elements of our balance sheet. I think it\u2019s fair to say that when you do deals of over $1 million and they grow as they have grown, many of those will be multi-year deals. The average deal term is not extending very long, although you will see the episodic, large transaction like we saw one or two in the most recent quarter. James, do you want to comment on that? ", "James Beer", "Certainly the vast preponderance of our deferred revenue is in the short-term category. That is important to remember. In terms of long-term deferred revenue, one of the most important elements of that balance historically, at least going back over the last year or so, were those multi-year subscriptions we sold in the consumer business. We were very interested to do that prior to the auto-renewal capability coming on stream. ", "We are very pleased with the results of auto-renewal so that has allowed us to rethink the pricing of our multiyear consumer subscriptions. So not surprisingly, when the discount on those multiyear subscriptions goes down, the volume comes down. We\u2019re very happy with that. That\u2019s exactly the balance that we were looking for based upon the strength of auto renewal. I think the takeaway is that our deferred revenue balance is largely a one-year time frame. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Adam Holt \u2013 JP Morgan. ", "Adam Holt \u2013 JP Morgan", "I\u2019ll ask a follow up on the bookings and deferred revenue question. I understand you may not be prepared to give specific commentary around deferred revenue or bookings growth for the year. If you are, that would be terrific, but if you\u2019re not, should we be thinking about bookings growth this year coming in faster than aggregate revenue growth? ", "John Thompson", "We don\u2019t actually provide, as you well know, bookings forecasts, but we do run our sales team on bookings targets. A booking will be not just be things that show up in the P&L for this period, but it will reflect a transactions that may have a multiyear term to it. Clearly bookings are going to have a disproportionately higher number associated with them in the aggregate than the actual FY2008 revenue that we will produce. That being said, our expectations are that bookings for FY2008 will grow faster than period revenue. ", "Adam Holt \u2013 JP Morgan", "Terrific. If I could just turn to the security business, you mentioned in your comments that Hamlet is going to be released at the upcoming user conference. Is that a GA release and what is your current thinking about how the Hamlet release is going to impact the pricing environment? Can you talk to us a little bit about how you view the revenue opportunity there? ", "John Thompson", "Our view is that we will launch Hamlet in June at our Vision conference. That is our premier customer event and it is the place where we want to showcase all the capabilities of Hamlet. Hamlet is the integration of not only many of the technologies that Symantec had in its portfolio for a long time, but a number of the acquisitions we have done over the last few years, where we will deliver an end point solution that literally uses far less systems resources and is a single agent on the desktop. ", "That is something that customers have wanted for a long, long time. It comes in a base product plus extensions that should allow us to drive a higher price point. As customers take the base, that will get a little bit more price, and as they add the extensions for network admission control and other things, that too should drive incrementally higher price. So it is our belief that the combination of the way it has been packaged, both technically and the price packaging of it should allow us to yield a higher price point per seat over time. ", "Adam Holt \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just to be clear, customers should be able to start buying Hamlet shortly thereafter the user conference? Or is GA going to lag the initial launch? ", "John Thompson", "We are going to extent the beta testing for Hamlet to make sure we get it right, with more than 50-70 million desktops using our products around the world, I am more concerned about getting it right as we did with Norton 360 than rushing it into the marketplace. We\u2019ll talk to you more about the release details at the June conference. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to John Walsh \u2013 Citigroup. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "James, you mentioned the capital structure that you would continue to evolve \u2013 should we assume that includes both a combination of share buybacks and potentially more debt? ", "James Beer", "I don\u2019t want to get into any particular specifics, but obviously those are both important elements of a capital structure, so they are very much the sorts of things we are sorting through in our minds as we look to really find what is the appropriate balance sheet for a company that has this sort of cash flow generation and this sort of predictability. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Just a follow-up again on the timing of Hamlet, maybe if you could help us \u2013 what is assumed in the full year guidance as far as the impact of Hamlet from a revenue and deferred revenue perspective? ", "James Beer", "I don\u2019t want to get into specifics down at product level, but obviously our thinking in terms of the future of Hamlet is absolutely baked into our fiscal year plan. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our last question from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "I have a quick question on Altiris with regard to your plan to integrate that into the rest of your product lines. How you see that evolving obviously, right now, you\u2019re managing it at stand alone. Longer term, how do you see that integrating in with the core products? When you do look at your product portfolio right now, do you feel comfortable with where you stand on the systems management side, or do you feel that you need more internal development or acquisitions there? ", "John Thompson", "First off, Altiris has their head down delivering on a solution tailored for Dell. That\u2019s a very, very important relationship. We want to make sure we deliver on the commitments we have made to Dell for a white label platform for managing the Dell, both client and server environment. Beyond that, we have integration plans in place already that speak to how modest overlaps between the two companies product portfolios will in fact be rationalized. The team has been meeting for the last several weeks to not only finalize those plans, but build a roadmap that is digestible by customers and partners around the world. ", "As a matter of fact, I was on the phone just this morning with one of our customers in Europe, talking through some issues on that roadmap. I think over time, there are clearly opportunities for us to look across both the Symantec portfolio and the Altiris portfolio to see where there might be leverage points. I will give you two in particular. On the data center management group side of the house, we bought a technology, a little company called Relacore a few years ago that has turned into the Veritas configuration manager. ", "That might be a wonderful piece of technology to snap into the Altiris suite. So the team is looking at how we might do that, because it could in fact populate the Altiris configuration management database. Coming the other, Altiris is looking at how it can link into Project Hamlet with its current product, the Release 6.0 product that is in the marketplace and clearly planning for linkage in its Release 7.0 product to not just Hamlet, but the other compliance solutions we have in our portfolio. ", "I think that given the nature of what Altiris is and how they designed the platform, it represents wonderful cross-pollinations opportunities across the two companies. On the broader question of whether we have enough or are we going to do more, I think it would be fair to say that the systems management market is full of holes from lots of vendors. Therefore there are lots of unmet needs for customers in the marketplace. As Altiris gained a lot of traction as we gain traction in our data center management group, I suspect you will see us deliver more organically and I suspect you will see us buy additional pieces to round out our portfolio. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Quickly on Dell\u2019s relationship with Landisk[?]. Do you see that having any effect on the Altiris business? ", "John Thompson", "No, not at all. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question and answer session. At this time, Mr. Thompson, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. ", "John Thompson", "Thank you very much. After what unquestionably was a very challenging FY2007, I think our company is in terrific shape and well positioned for not only improved stabilization and operating efficiencies this year, but much stronger top line and bottom line growth. Thank you for your patience. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, and good afternoon everyone for joining us today. With me today are John Thompson, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec, and James Beer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "In a moment, I will turn the call over to John. He'll provide highlights of the fiscal first quarter results, which ended June 29, of 2007, then James will provide financial details and review our guidance as outlined in the press release.", "Then we will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations home page. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are also available on our website and a copy of today's prepared comments will be available on the investor relations website shortly after the call is completed.", "As mentioned in our press release, Symantec adopted FASB interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Uncertainty and Income Taxes during the June quarter. As such, our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fiscal first quarter include the adoption of FIN-48. Also during the June quarter, we made several adjustments to our business segment.", "We have recast maintenance revenues for each quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 2006. In addition, we have added a new business segment called Altiris and have moved a few products from our Security and Data Management unit into our services and Altiris segment. We have provided historical comparative information for these adjustments in this quarter's supplemental financial package, which is available on our website.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the information discussed on this call including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements.", "These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.", "In addition, to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release as well as on our website supplemental information.", "And now, with that, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. John Thompson.", "John Thompson", "Thanks, Helen. I'm very pleased with our team's ability to execute our operating plan, and deliver solid June quarter results. The performance for the quarter was driven by strong demand for many of our core and emerging technology solutions as well as solid execution by our services, consumer and Altiris groups.", "We focused on improving our day-to-day business operations, which contributed to better than expected revenue yield and lower expense growth in our core businesses. The higher in period revenue was partially offset by a lower deferred revenue balance, as we recognize a greater portion of revenue in the quarter.", "While 70% of our large deals included multiple Symantec products in the June quarter, we experienced a year-over-year decline in our large transaction volumes. This decline is primarily attributable to weaker than expected business in the Americas.", "We believe, this was a Symantec's specific issue and as such took action to address the issues earlier this month. We expect our America's performance to improve over time. We are pleased however with the performance of our Altiris business unit.", "The team moved quickly to leverage Symantec's powerful go-to-market model to fuel geographic expansion. As a result, Altiris recorded its largest transaction ever outside the U.S. and the pipeline for the business looks stronger than ever. While our direct sales force is focused on developing relationships with large enterprises, we've also built an ecosystem of over 60,000 channel partners and resellers.", "Over the past two quarters we've implemented significant enhancements in our systems environment all focused on improving the ease of doing business with Symantec. We continue to make progress with our licensing portal and buying programs, which resulted in stronger revenue gains in our channel-based business.", "Now, I'd like to take a minute to discuss a few highlights from each of our business units. The Data Center Management group posted a strong quarter and NetBackup performed well and Storage Foundation products produced record revenue results. Once again, these results were driven by our customers' desire to standardize and simplify their data center infrastructure.", "During the quarter, we launched our next-generation data protection solution, NetBackup 6.5, which will start shipping in a couple of weeks. NetBackup provides a single platform to unify recovery management across all protection technologies, and delivers innovative new disk-based data protection capabilities.", "Within our Security and Data Management group, our core windows-based data recovery solution, Backup Exec returned to solid levels driven by strength in the new product, and the success of our channel initiatives. We also continued to see solid growth in the emerging product areas of compliance and enterprise messaging.", "Specifically, our compliance products, control compliance suite and Enterprise Security Manager, as well as our AntiSpam products showed strong year-over-year growth. In June, we launched our next-generation enterprise endpoint protection solution, formerly known as Hamlet. We remain on track to ship the product towards the end of this quarter.", "Symantec endpoint protection lowers the total cost of ownership through centralized management, ease of deployment and seemless integration of several market leading security functions. Furthermore, we believe our customers will appreciate the smaller footprint and improve resource utilization of this product.", "After a record March quarter, our services group posted another solid quarter of double-digit growth. The June quarter results were driven by strong contributions from Company I, a U.K. consultancy we acquired last December. Company I is a great example of how a strategic acquisition of a services company can provide tremendous leverage for Symantec in certain vertical or geographic markets.", "Our services team is building a focused complementary services business that helps customers address their IT risk management challenges. By pulling together our portfolio products with services, we have the unique opportunity to assist our customers in an area of growing importance and complexity.", "Now let me spend a moment on our new Altiris business unit. I couldn't be more pleased with how the business unit and management team are integrating with the Symantec team. Last year, Dell launched a software management strategy based on an open platform, and they chose Altiris's unified architecture. This relationship remains quite strong and contributed meaningfully to the team's June quarter results.", "In addition, we're integrating and leveraging our technologies on several fronts. For example, we developed a special connector that provides the ability for us to synchronize the database between Symantec endpoint protection, and the Altiris configuration management database, helping to reduce the cost and complexity of software migration. This also provides an opportunity for us to upsell customers to our patch management solution by selling the Altiris client management suite, our total management suite.", "Our consumer business posted another strong quarter of double-digit growth led by sales of Norton Internet Security. Growth was particularly strong in the Amaya region. Having experienced a full quarter of contribution from Norton 360 sales, we are now quite pleased with its initial uptake. Norton 360 has been the most successful consumer product launch in Symantec's history.", "Earlier this month, the consumer team launched another new product called Norton AntiBot. According to our latest Internet security threat report, bot infected computers grew by 29% during the second half of 2006 to more than 6 million infected machines.", "These bots are covertly installed on users machines in order to allow an unauthorized user to control the computer remotely. This allows a remote attacker to take control of a large number of compromised machines and create a bot network, which can then be used to launch a coordinated attack.", "In addition, later this quarter the consumer team will launch the new 2008 versions of Norton Internet Security and Norton Antivirus. These products will look to continue our focus on delivering market-leading functionality, and further enhance the recognition of our Norton brand.", "In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the past few quarters and believe many of the initiatives we implemented last year are beginning to bear fruit. With a solid first quarter behind us, we are well positioned for the balance of fiscal 2008.", "We will continue to take steps to drive our competitive differentiation in the marketplace through continued new product innovation, improve our internal cost structure, and improve our relationships with customers and partners around the world.", "And with that, I'd like to hand that call over to James.", "James Beer", "Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. Solid performance in the June quarter is a good indication of the progress we are making towards our FY '08 targets. GAAP revenue for our June 2007 quarter was $1.4 billion.", "Non-GAAP revenue grew 10% versus the June 2006 period to $1.42 billion, as we did a good job of converting our sales activity into recognized revenue. Excluding the addition of the revenue we acquired from Altiris, non-GAAP revenue grew by 6% year-over-year.", "Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP revenue by $38 million in the June 2007 quarter, as compared to June 2006. Sequentially, foreign currency movements had approximately a $15 million positive impact on revenue. The June quarter's diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.10.", "Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.29 up 21% compared to the June 2006 results. This significant percentage increase is an illustration of the value we can create for our shareholders as a result of the substantial buyback activity totaling $7 billion in the last two years that we have completed.", "International non-GAAP revenue for the June quarter grew 12% to $727 million, versus the year-ago period, and represented 51% of total non-GAAP revenue. The Europe, Middle East, Africa region grew 15% and Asia-Pacific including Japan grew 8%. The Americas grew 8% year-over-year. Holding currency constant international revenue grew 7% year-over-year.", "Now I'd like to move to revenue by segment in the June 2007 quarter. Consumer revenue generated $424 million up 11% versus the June 2006 quarter. Electronic distribution channels represented 72% of consumer revenue, and grew 19% versus the June 2006 quarter.", "Norton Internet Security revenue grew 31% and remains the single largest product contributor to our consumer category, generating approximately 63% of consumer revenue.", "Moving now to our enterprise segments, during the June 2007 quarter we defined the new Altiris business unit as made up of the acquired Altiris products plus our Ghost, pcAnywhere and LiveState Delivery products. These three products moved over from the Security and Data Management segment in order to enhance our go-to-market activities around endpoint management.", "We also moved our managed security services and deep-site business lines to the services segment from the Security and Data Management segment in order to create a single area of focus for our service-related activities.", "In addition, following our ERP implementation during the December 2006 quarter, we completed an analysis of how maintenance revenues were being allocated among our enterprise segments. Maintenance analysis largely benefits the Data Center Management group so the offsetting detriment of the Security and Data Management segment.", "These initiatives have resulted in us recasting our segment data, both for this fiscal year and for the prior two fiscal years. We have provided historical comparative data for these reclassifications in the supplemental information, which is posted on our investor relations website.", "The June quarter performance for the recasted segments is as follows: our Security and Data Management revenue of $424 million grew by 4% versus the June 2006 quarter. The Data Center Management group produced revenue of $404 million, and grew 5% from the year-ago period.", "And our services unit posted another strong performance, increasing revenue to $81 million, up 13% from the June 2006 quarter. Services represented 6% of our total revenue during the June2007 quarter.", "The Altiris business unit generated non-GAAP revenue of $89 million, of which the three Symantec products produced $36 million of the segment revenue. And the former Altiris products contributed the remaining $53 million. Altiris' non-GAAP revenue includes the impact of $16 million worth of deferred revenue lost on a GAAP basis as a result of the purchase accounting method related to the acquisition of Altiris.", "Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 84.8% for the June 2007 quarter, compared to 83.9% for the year-ago period, driven by the divestiture last year of the Symantec-built appliances business, and by the movement of the consumer OEM fees from the cost of goods sold line to operating expenses, as we discussed on our May conference call.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of $841 million for the June 2007 quarter were flat sequentially, and up 16 % year-over-year. Expenses grew primarily due to three factors. Altiris added $31 million, foreign exchange movements added $21 million, and the OEM issue, I just mentioned, added $42 million to our operating expense base.", "However, we were able to offset a portion of this expense growth by accelerating the pace of our cost reduction activities ahead of plan this quarter.", "Therefore, operating expenses grew only 3% year-over-year after adjusting for exchange rates, OEM fees and Altiris. GAAP net income was $95 million for the June 2007 quarter. Non-GAAP net income equaled $263 million, up nearly 4% as compared to June 2006.", "Symantec adopted FIN48 the new standard related to Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes during the June 2007 quarter. As a result, we performed a comprehensive reevaluation of our tax risks, which resulted in a net decrease to our tax reserves of $18 million. As a result, goodwill was reduced by $11 million, retained earnings increased by $6 million, and stockholders' equity increased by $1 million.", "Symantec exited June with a cash and short-term investments balance of $2 billion, a decline of $953 million versus the end of the March quarter. The decline is attributable to our purchase of Altiris, which reduced our cash and short-term investment balance by $810 million, and our repurchase of $500 million of our outstanding shares.", "During the June quarter, we repurchased 25 million shares at an average price of $19.76. Our net accounts receivable balance at the end of the June 2007 quarter was $569 million.", "Day's sales outstanding or DSO was 36 days in line with normal seasonal trends. Cash flow from operating activities for the June 2007 quarter is expected to be between $345 million and $350 million. This is lower than our original expectation.", "Year-over-year our cash flow from operations were impacted by higher fees paid to consumer OEMs, and by the weakness in the Americas that John noted. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the June 2007 quarter was approximately $2.665 billion.", "Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $2.709 billion, up 16% compared to the June 2006 quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of the June quarter is typically lower than at the end of the March quarter, due to seasonally trends. In addition, deferred revenue was impacted by the stronger than expected recognized revenue yield that we generated during the June quarter.", "Lastly, foreign exchange rates had a positive benefit on deferred revenue of approximately $61 million versus June 2006.", "During the September quarter we expect about $905 million of our non-GAAP deferred revenue balance to convert into recognized revenue. This is 7% higher than the equivalent June 2007 quarter amount, and 17% higher than the year-ago period. We continue to benefit from an increasing volume of predictable revenue rolling off the balance sheet driven by our deferred revenue model.", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance. Given the current business environment and an exchange rate of $1.33 per euro. Our forecast for the September quarter is as follows: GAAP revenue is estimated to be between $1.35 billion and $1.38 billion. Non-GAAP revenue is estimated to be between $1.37 billion and $1.4 billion.", "GAAP earnings per share are forecasted between $0.07 and $0.09. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated between $0.24 and $0.26. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $2.53 billion and $2.58 billion. We expect non-GAAP deferred revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion.", "The September quarter cash flow from operating activities is expected to be the lowest quarterly figure for the year, following normal seasonal patterns. September quarter operating cash flow is expected to be below the $276 million we recorded in the September 2006 quarter.", "The lower cash flow estimate is primarily due to the payment of higher consumer OEM fees year-over-year and to the weak Americas activity noted in the June quarter.", "While we are pleased with our June quarter results and with the prospects for the September quarter, we plan to update our guidance one quarter at a time. We do not plan to revisit our full-year guidance until the beginning of the March quarter on our January earnings call.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thanks, James. Will you please begin polling for questions?", " Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Helyn Corcos", "While Tom is polling for questions, I'd like to announce that Symantec plans to attend the Citigroup conference on September 6. We will be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on October 24. This information will also be posted on our events calendar on the website.", "For a complete list of these events, please feel free to visit the investor relations website. Tom, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hi guys, nice quarter.", "John Thompson", "Thanks, Todd.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "So John, I just want to focus on the new desktop client you guys are about to ship, some of your competitors have been describing it as a forklift upgrade and in positioning it as a potential opportunity to take some shares from you guys, and I have two questions.", "One, how do you see the profit in terms of upgrading the client, how challenging will it be for a customer to roll this out? And then two, what do you think it potentially does to your growth profile of your Security and Data Management business? Should we see an acceleration as this product comes into the market?", "John Thompson", "First off, you should not believe what competitors say about our technology. They have agenda of their own, which may not necessarily be consistent with what we intend to deliver. That said, we don't expect the new endpoint protection solution to be any more difficult to go from, let's say, version 9 to version 10, and in this case version 10 to version 11.", "Clearly if you have a very large tens of thousand client network there is a significant amount of planning that goes on in that process. And we have a series of pools that we will deliver with both the endpoint product itself, and through our Altiris business unit that will help our customers through the migration process. So I think Dave and his team need to go find someplace else to play.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then the second part of my question in terms of should we see an acceleration as the product starts to hit the market?", "John Thompson", "Well, I don't think there's an acceleration that should be expected out of the chute. As you may recall, Todd, our customers take advantage of what we call upgrade insurance. And so as the product is made available, they are entitled to the base product. Where the opportunity lies for us is in two places.", "First, in the network admission control component, which is a new module that represents a net upsell opportunity. And quite frankly for competitive take-outs, where we think the combination of our Altiris capability and a much, much better client than is available currently in the marketplace certainly should give us great opportunities for revenue growth.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks guys, good quarter.", "John Thompson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with UBS.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Hi, John, a couple of questions. First you mentioned some changes in the Americas, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about what changes in fact you're making, if you could go into a little more detail.", "And then the second question is really for James, if you could update us on the new buyback initiative that you announced at the analyst day. Thank you.", "John Thompson", "Well, Heather, we made a change in the leadership at the top of the Americas organization as we started the September quarter. That change was precipitated by quite frankly, our recognition that morale in the Americas team was declining, and attrition was rising. And we felt that we needed to make changes to address that right away and we did.", "We brought in a very, very experienced leader, one who's well-known to the Americas team, has led and produced terrific results for us in Asia-Pacific and we know that Bill Robins will get the Americas back on track.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Are there any account level changes, though, when you say changes in the Americas, is it senior leadership or...", "John Thompson", "This is about senior leadership.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Okay. Not about the people covering the accounts?", "John Thompson", "There are always account changes that go on all the time. I mean, that's kind of a normal part of running an enterprise sales force. And we saw some instability, in that regard in the western region in particular, but beyond that, I think this is just normal Q4 to Q1 kind of transition stuff that goes on.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Okay. And then just James on the buyback, please?", "James Beer", "Yeah. On the buyback, obviously in the June quarter we finished off the previous billion dollar buyback program completing $500 million of buyback activity. And so now we're pleased that our board announced the new $2 billion program that we discussed at the analyst day.", "Our thinking with regards to executing on the $2 billion program is much as was the case with the previous billion dollars program. We're going to be proceeding on an opportunistic basis.", "Obviously, that makes it a very hard to necessarily predict with any precision the accretion dilution impact of the program. Obviously, it's very much driven by when you buy, at what price, and factors such as that. So, I guess I would say that I've been a little bit surprised as to some of the estimates that I've seen out there as to how accretive this would be. Some of those estimates look a little high.", "The other thing I would say about buybacks generally is of course that we've got 7 billion done now over the last couple years, and that was a big driver to that 21% EPS growth that we were able to record during the quarter. So it was good to see some of the fruits of that activity.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "So, is there anything factored into the September quarter guidance, then in terms of buybacks?", "James Beer", "We're not offering specific direction. Our approach is that as we proceed through a quarter, we'll at the end of that quarter just provide everyone with status and so forth. So again, it will really be very much driven by how we roll out this opportunistic approach.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Great. Thank you.", "James Beer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Cowen.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Hi guys. I'm wondering if you can just talk a bit about the perpetual ratable mix or the in-period revenue, as you call it. What drove that during the quarter? I assume it was more license, less maintenance renewals and then also how that tied into the large deal count.", "Was that part of the deal where you had large maintenance renewals in the year-ago period and you didn't see as much of that activity this year?", "John Thompson", "I'll make comments and I'll let James talk. I think the real difference we saw this quarter was our channel-based business, particularly Backup Exec, did very, very well. That business had been significantly impacted by our ERP systems change that occurred right at the same time that we launched a new product.", "And so fundamentally, once the dust settled on our licensing portal and our new buying programs, what we saw was real strength in Backup Exec, which is a product that has the profound impact of being able to deliver great in-quarter revenue results as compared to some of the large deals that we do that tend to go to the balance sheet, if you will.", "Now, what we saw in big deals was a decline in big deals, not so much in the context of maintenance deals, because most of those get booked in our fiscal third and fourth quarter. But we saw weakness in the Americas in particular, in large deal sizes, and we felt that some of that had to do with the stability or lack thereof of the team. And as I mentioned in Heather's question, we've taken action to fix that.", "James Beer", "And the only thing I'd add, I was very pleased during the quarter with the degree of coordination between the folks in the sales force and everyone in the back office, if you will. I think we had a good execution quarter and that assisted us. Obviously, that's a trend we're very much working hard to continue.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan.", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "Good afternoon. My first question is around the DCM business. The year-on-year growth was the best we've seen in a couple of quarters. I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about what the drivers were there particularly given that the NetBackup 6.0 release is not in the market yet.", "And is it possible to give what the apples-to-apples growth rate would have been on the old accounting or segment definition?", "John Thompson", "I don't have a clue, Adam, what it would be on an apples-to-apples basis. I'll let Helyn and the team see if they can help you with that at a later point. But I think what did happen for DCMG this quarter is NetBackup 6.0 is a much more stable product now, and NetBackup 6.5 is clearly on path to be delivered here very shortly.", "But underpinning all of that was very strong performance in the Storage Foundation product family, and that's what set the business up for 5% revenue growth. That said we should lap the model change that we made in the DCMG business this quarter. So it's our expectation that we will see continued acceleration in DCMG's business as we move through the fiscal year.", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "And I guess that leads me to my second question, which is around the deferred revenue guidance for the next quarter down sequentially, I just wanted to make sure I understood what sort of the thinking was around that.", "Does that mean that you're being a little bit more conservative with respect to larger deals that closed in the quarter or is it a function of the fact that you do expect more revenue to come off the balance sheet in quarter?", "James Beer", "Well, Adam, one of the charts you may recall that I showed at analyst day split the deferred revenue history over the last several quarters up into year halves, first half versus second half. And that showed that we tended to have much less growth flat down a little bit between the first quarter and the second quarter, and then we would see stronger deferred revenue in the third and the fourth quarter.", "Now, of course we're starting off with a lower balance as a result of the activity that ended up in recognized revenue in the June quarter, and so I think those are the factors that have fed us through to the guidance that we've offered this afternoon.", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "And again, ladies and gentlemen, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question, and one follow-up. We'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Good Afternoon, guys, good quarter.", "James Beer", "Thanks Sarah.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Very nice bring back in your operating margins. So could you maybe give us an update on where we are in terms of your cost reduction activities? And in particular, is there still low hanging fruit out there to get the organization back to those levels you were at a couple of years back?", "John Thompson", "Well, I'd just say Sarah that we feel as though we're ahead of schedule with regard to our $200 million program that we announced back in January. So obviously that's been a lot of hard work by the team here. And we're going to stay very focused on operating margins, obviously.", "James Beer", "I would also add, Sarah that the business today is a very different business than the one a few years ago, when we had 30-plus point operating margins. That business was 50-plus percent to consumer with very, very high operating margin content, and that's not the way that Company's is profiled today.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's fair enough. And then if I could just follow-up on your comment on NetBackup 6.5, similar to Todd's question around the endpoint 11.0 release, what is the upside potential there, John? Is it getting new customers, is it new add-on feature functionality that you can upsell?", "John Thompson", "Well, the first upside opportunity is around what we call NAC or Network Admission Control. We have the market-leading product with the sigh gate solution, it will be much more tightly integrated and easy to install out of the box. And so our expectation is that our sales teams and our channel partners will work very hard to upsell, if you will, base customers to the NAC solution.", "And then beyond that, it's the opportunity to combine our Altiris team with our endpoint protection team to really go have a lot of fun with competitive take-outs. And so while some may view this as a forklift, we view this as an opportunity to stick a fork in a fat cat right here in the valley.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Let me leave it there because I was actually asking more around the NetBackup 6.5 upgrade.", "John Thompson", "Oh, NetBackup. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all excited about this action; I can't help it.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "That's okay.", "John Thompson", "NetBackup 6.5 is clearly a terrific upgrade from the 6.0 product. It includes our disk space backup capability and starts to move NetBackup to become a storage management platform, if you will.", "So rather than it just being a backup product, we will use it as the foundation to deliver a range of incremental services, if you will, into existing accounts, and I think the team has done a really, really nice job in the re-architecture, if you will, of that product.", "James Beer", "I think we got particularly warm reception at our vision user conference a month or so back to the news of 6.5 and its capabilities.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Terrific. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ed Maguire with Merrill Lynch.", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just comment on the trends in the consumer, whether you're seeing any impact from Vista and how the uptake has been so far on Norton 360 overall?", "John Thompson", "Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, Ed, Norton 360 has been the single most successful product we've ever launched in the consumer business out of the chute.", "Volumes have been just tremendous. And while Norton Internet Security continues to be the largest product revenue contributor, if you will, it too grew at 31% last quarter. So the business is performing quite well.", "On the Vista front, we think we saw in the June quarter activity that may have adversely affected our consumer business just a little bit around some of the Vista upgrade activity and rebates that were going on in the marketplace. But that appears to have abated and the consumer business is doing quite well.", "But we're going to continue to watch our products are all Vista-compatible and are shipping, if you will, on the OEM machines that we have relationships with. But Vista is not a big revenue-based opportunity for us beyond any other windows platform, quite frankly.", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And a follow-up for James. It looks like for your September quarter guidance here you're assuming a, I guess, a slightly higher operating run rate.", "Could you help us understand where you'd had some offsets in the first quarter whether particularly on the OEM side, whether some of those maybe continuing into the second quarter?", "James Beer", "Yeah, I would certainly expect the OEM costs to continue on into the second quarter. As you may recall, many of those contracts are now structured on a per-PC per-laptop shipped by the OEM, and I think you've seen quite a bit of strong data from the computer manufacturers as to demand for those types of products.", "So, certainly I would expect that to continue on into the year. And obviously we're very focused and interested in what happens at the end of the 60-day trial that the customer has, and we're very busy in that regard.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tom Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Tom Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good afternoon, everybody. I just want to jump over to the consumer business. You mentioned a particular strength in Europe. Can you sort of walk us through that? Was there a particular product or was it just economic conditions improving over there or currency? Can you walk us through what's driving the business in Europe?", "John Thompson", "Well, it was in reference to our consumer business, and I think the answer in Europe is better balance across all of the channels than we saw in any of the other regions. The retail channel for our EMEA team held up stronger if you will than the retail channel and other regions around the world.", "Online continues to be strong for us, but it was the balance, if you will, that we saw in Europe that made the difference.", "Tom Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, good. And then sort of a high-level question, with the consumer business appearing to be pretty steady, that does throw off a lot of cash like you mentioned earlier, have you guys given any further thought to capital structure? Obviously you guys have capacity to go to a more traditional large company capital structure. What's the thinking?", "James Beer", "Yeah, I wouldn't say that anything has changed in our thinking at all versus the comments that we've made in recent quarters. So we're being very thoughtful about that issue. Obviously, the markets have certainly become a bit choppier in recent days and weeks here so this is a topic that we spend a lot of time thinking about.", "Tom Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Very good, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question from Daniel Ives with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.", "Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Hey guys, solid quarter. Can you just talk about year-end guidance again in regards to like not giving, I mean, are you like withdrawing the former guidance?", "I mean how should we look at the year, especially just given the strength this quarter and the buyback? Can you just maybe speak to that anecdotally, as I know you're not giving guidance?", "James Beer", "Yeah, we're very much just taking the perspective that at the start of the year, we'll outline to everyone our perspective on how the year could play out. And then we'll really focus our business, our efforts quarter-by-quarter, and we feel as though it makes sense to give detailed guidance on a quarterly basis. So that's all it is.", "It's just a tuning of the philosophy as to what level volume of guidance we should be offering in the marketplace.", "Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Okay, and to that point, so do you still maintain your year-end guidance that you gave on top and bottom line originally?", "James Beer", "Well, you see again, I just restate what I said. We issued that guidance this time, 90 days or so ago, and we are just going to leave it there. We wouldn't plan to update annual guidance one way or another.", "Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Okay.", "James Beer", "So that's the approach.", "Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Thanks. Good quarter. Thanks.", "James Beer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi guys, I just want to spend a little bit of time on the consumer side again, just wondering what trends you saw from a seasonality perspective during Q2 here.", "Obviously you've gone to more of a deferred model, so it shows up more on the balance sheet, but just wondering if you could give trends there, any impact you think from Vista shipping earlier this year on this customer buying patterns or is this sort of a typical June quarter?", "John Thompson", "Well, I'd say this is a fairly typical June quarter for the consumer business. It is traditionally seasonally down in June. It starts to build momentum in the month of September based upon the shipment of new products that we make, and then it peaks in the fiscal third and fourth quarter for us.", "And so I don't think that we could point to anything that would say June was abnormal from a pattern point of view, normal pattern. And I'll stand on my comments of a bit ago, Phil, which is Vista is really not an event for us in the consumer markets.", "As the OEMs preload Vista on their machines, our business is to create a Vista-compatible product to go along with that, and we've done that. It's been in the marketplace since the OEMs have been shipping Vista.", "So there is no unique opportunity in the consumer segment driven by the Vista migration. There is however, an opportunity for us in the mid market as we look at the combination of our Altiris products and the endpoint protection suite that we will be delivering.", "And we think, given the strength of Altiris in mid market activities, their real strong relationship with many of the OEMs, that represents a unique opportunity for us around Vista that doesn't exist necessarily in the consumers segment.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great. And then James, as far as the September quarter, you discussed a little bit about the deferred revenue guidance being down sequentially. Is that related to any specific segment, consumer, Security and Data Management, etcetera?", "James Beer", "No, it's really not. I'd say nothing unusual in that regard.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Kevin Buttigieg with A.G. Edwards.", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Thank you. Just going back to the consumer business for a moment. Now that you have a full quarter of Norton 360 behind you, I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there in terms of the dynamics, in terms of is the business attracting new customers to Symantec?", "Is it driving upgrades from Norton Internet Security or perhaps Norton Antivirus given the continuing declines in that business? And just sort of you've talked in the past about the consumer business being a low double-digit type of growth business or a low teens type of growth business.", "Does the Norton 360 opportunity perhaps because of an ASP perspective or for new subscribers that you might get through it, influence that number to the positive? Or how should we think about revenue growth in the consumer business post-Norton 360?", "John Thompson", "Well, we haven't given specific segment growth guidance for this year, and we're not going to change that stance just because we're having great success with Norton 360. That said, what Norton 360 appears to be doing is taking some opportunity away from Norton Internet security, and upselling some customers from Norton antivirus.", "Both of which represent price up for us, because the Norton 360 product is priced at a higher price point. So, our sense is that this is the right way to have, if you will, good, better, best in the marketplace, and customers will choose the price point and the functional mix that they want. And as they move to higher function, we should yield higher average selling prices.", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "And then any comment on in terms of new subscribers that you might be getting through Norton 360?", "John Thompson", "No, we don't tend to talk about subscriber growth. That is not something that's a part of the way we manage our activities in the consumer business. Clearly, we monitor it and track it, but we don't disclose it.", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Thank you.", "Operator", "John Walsh from Citigroup.", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. If you could talk about just the high-level macro environment, what you see on the enterprise specifically North America versus Europe for the current quarter, and then what you saw last quarter?", "John Thompson", "Well, I think our guidance reflects a sense of continued strength and momentum. If anything, slightly better performance in the Americas than we saw in the fiscal first quarter. Clearly our APJ business is doing very, very well. EMEA seems to be holding with Germany still an economic challenge, but our business in Germany having stabilized quite a bit from what we saw over a year ago.", "Our issues now are focused on bringing our new Americas leader on board, making sure that he's got the right footing under him and the right set of metrics in place for how he wants to manage his team, but he's off to a good start. Hopefully it will only improve from here.", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Okay. On the consumer side, any pushback you're hearing from the channel or from consumers about the auto renewal feature?", "John Thompson", "No, not at all.", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Yeah. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus a little bit on pricing within the enterprise security market. On 10.2, I believe you guys raised price, I was just curious what the customer response has been, have you seen any pushback on that front?", "John Thompson", "Rob, quite frankly, I can't say that I have. I mean, clearly our challenge right now is to get 11.0 out the door, and to get it seated into the marketplace, and that's where the team is very, very much focused.", "Our expectation is that it should be a fairly rapid uptake for current users of Symantec 10.0 or prior releases, and we'll see whether or not we can upsell, therefore, get some price yield on the Mac solutions or some of the competitive take-out programs we have planned.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "With regard to that recent price increase, how should we think about growth as a function of that? Should that begin to impact that security line as we move throughout the remainder of fiscal 2008, just as a function of most revenue being deferred?", "John Thompson", "We have not given segment-specific growth guidance for this year. Our expectation however, is that all of our businesses have been planned for growth, and we would expect to see a continuation in momentum building in the SDAMG team as well.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Katherine Egbert with Jeffries.", "Katherine Egbert - Jeffries", "Hi, I just have a quick question about guidance, you guys have done a really nice job the last quarters, reporting upside, now your saying you're not going to be giving annual guidance. There's been a formulation change in the last few quarters regarding the way you do guidance, which really made you more focused in the short-term?", "James Beer", "Well, again, I mean I wouldn't characterize it, as we're not giving annual guidance. We are going to give annual guidance; we just give it at the start of the year. So hopefully that in combination with our quarterly updates to the coming quarter will give a lot of information to the marketplace, perhaps quite a bit more than some other companies offer these days.", "John Thompson", "There appears to be a fair amount of short-term focus amongst many of our investors as well. And so focusing on what we can deliver next quarter is very much responding to what we perceive to be the short-term interest of some of our investors as well.", "Katherine Egbert - Jeffries", "Okay. Thanks for that. And one quick one, what do you make of Google buying post Genie, do you see that as a competitive threat?", "John Thompson", "Well, we don't offer per se a hosted mail service. We have a partnership through a firm called MX Logics that does offer our AntiSpam solution through their hosted mail service. We're not completely sure of what Google's intent might be there.", "We view that it's much more focused on the aggregate issue of Google Apps, not just hosted mail. And mail is just one of array of things that they will offer through their Google Apps service.", "And so we'll obviously monitor this quite closely. Our Symantec protection network does have plans to deliver this fiscal year a series of hosted services some that may ultimately compete with what Google's plans might be.", "Katherine Egbert - Jeffries", "Okay. Thank you, John.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Shaul Eyal with CIBC World Markets.", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Good quarter. A quick question, since you talked before on the ASP trends, as you look into the consumer business, security data management and kind of the DCM business, were the majority of ASP interest is being generated from any particular segment?", "James Beer", "Well, I wouldn't get into specifics as to ASP by business units, I'd certainly just echo John's earlier comments on the consumer side, where we've seen a variety of new products over the last year or so that are going nicely at higher ASPs.", "In the enterprise side of the house, obviously, pricing becomes more complicated deal-by-deal and so forth to talk about it in any particular generalities. But it's fair to say we're quite satisfied with the overall direction here.", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "All right. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brian Freed with Morgan Keegan.", "Brian Freed - Morgan Keegan", "Hi guys, great quarter. Real quick with two major products beginning shipping this quarter, 6.5 and Hamlet; how have you guys within the sales organization accounted for potential of purchasing freeze ahead of deployment and dealing with the test and eval cycles for those?", "Is it a function of large beta programs in place or can you comment a little more on that?", "John Thompson", "Well, we've certainly had a beta program in place for both of these offerings. And we've used the feedback from that beta program not just to enhance the product itself, but to reflect that in our marketing messaging to reflect that in our services strategy, to reflect that in the advice and counsel that we give our partners as they go to move these products in the marketplace.", "Our forecast reflects our view of how those products will do this quarter, and as we see their performance in the marketplace, we'll update our guidance a quarter at a time. And hopefully it will reflect better than anticipated or expected results from both 6.5 and Sef11.", "Helyn Corcos", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Rueppel with Wachovia Securities.", "Phillip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", "Thanks very much. Just quickly, if you could drill down a little bit on the Backup Exec strength, you talked about the convergence of the new product and the ERP issue.", "Was the strength a flush of the pinup demand or could you see that carrying through continued growth going forward much as your commentary about NetBackup would be with its new product release? Thanks.", "John Thompson", "Actually it was not a flush, business in the mid market for that kind of product tends to be perishable if you're not there on the shelf and available, they pick someone else's. So it's not a function of there was this bubble of opportunity that was waiting for us to clear up our licensing portal, to the contrary.", "We have reflected in our forecast a view that there's likely to be some continued strength in that product as we look at this quarter, because the 11B product is a very, very strong product. It's doing well in all channels in all markets, and I think we can continue to build momentum there for sure.", "Phillip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Thompson for closing remarks.", "John Thompson", "Well thank you very much for dialing in. We're awfully pleased with our team's performance in the fiscal first quarter of '08. We're off to a good start. It's one solid quarter and we're focused on the next. Thank you very much for calling.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. ", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone for joining us today. With me today are John Thompson, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec, and James Beer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, I will turn the call over to John. He'll provide highlights of the fiscal first quarter results which ended June 29 of 2007, then James will provide financial details and review our guidance as outlined in the press release. ", "Then we will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's investor relations home page, a copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are also available on our Website and a copy of today's prepared comments will be available on the investor relations Website shortly after the call is completed. ", "As mention I understand our press release, Symantec adopted FASB interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Uncertainty and Income Taxes during the June quarter. As such, our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fiscal first quarter include the adoption of FIN-48. Also during the June quarter we made several adjustments to our business segment. ", "We have recast maintenance revenues for each quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 2006. In addition, we have added a new business segment called Altiris and have moved a few products from our Security and Data Management unit into our services and Altiris segment. We have provided historical comparative information for these adjustments in this quarter's supplemental financial package available on our Website. ", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the information discussed on this call including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ", "Symantec assumes no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. In addition, to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investor are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results which can be found in the press release as well as on our Website supplemental information. And now, with that, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. John Thompson. ", "John Thompson", "Thanks, Helen. I'm very pleased with our teams ability to execute our operating plan and deliver solid June quarter results. The performance for the quarter was driven by strong demand for many of our core and emerging technology solutions as well as solid execution by our services, consumer and Altiris groups. We focused on improving our day-to-day business operations, which contributed to better than expected revenue yield and lower expense growth in our core businesses. The higher in period revenue was partially offset by a lower deferred revenue balance, as we recognize a greater portion of revenue in the quarter. ", "While 70% of our large deals included multiple Symantec products in the June quarter, we experienced a year-over-year decline in our large transaction volumes. This decline is primarily attributable to weaker than expected business in the Americas. We believe this was a Symantec specific issue and as such took action to address the issues earlier this month. We expect our America's performance to improve over time. We are pleased; however, with the performance of our Altiris business unit. The team moved quickly to leverage Symantec's powerful go-to-market model to fuel geographic expansion. ", "As a result, Altiris recorded its largest transaction ever outside the U.S. and the pipeline for the business looks stronger than ever. While our direct sales force is focused on developing relationships with large enterprises, we've also built an ecosystem of over 60,000 channel partners and resellers. Over the past two quarters we have implemented significant enhancements in our systems environment all focused on improving the ease of doing business with Symantec. We continue to make progress with our licenses portal and buying programs which resulted in stronger revenue gains in our channel-based business. ", "Now, I'd like to take minute to discuss a few miles from each of our business units. The Data Center Management group posted a strong quarter and backup -- NetBackup performed well and Storage Foundation products produced record revenue results. Once again, these results were driven by our customers' desire to standardize and simplify their data center infrastructure. ", "During the quarter, we launched our next-generation data protection solution, NetBackup 6.5, which will start shipping in a couple of weeks. NetBackup provides a single platform to unify recovery management across all protection technologies, and delivers innovative new disk-based data protection capabilities. Within our Security and Data Management group, our core windows-based data recovery solution, Backup Exec returned to solid levels driven by strength in the new product, and the success of our channel initiatives. We also continued to see solid growth in the emerging product areas of compliance and enterprise messaging. ", "Specifically, our compliance products, control compliance suite and Enterprise Security Manager, as well as our AntiSpam products, showed strong year-over-year growth. In June, we launched our next-generation enterprise endpoint protection solution, formerly known as Hamlet. We remain on track to ship the product towards the end of this year quarter. Symantec endpoint protection lowers the total cost of ownership through centralized management, ease of deployment and seamless integration of several market leading securities functions. Furthermore, we believe our customers will appreciate the smaller footprint and improved resource utilization of this product. ", "After a record March quarter, our services group posted another solid quarter of double-digit growth. The June quarter results were driven by strong contributions from Company I, a U.K. consultancy we acquired last December. Company I, is a great example of how a strategic acquisition of a services company can provide tremendous leverage for Symantec in certain vertical or geographic markets. Our services team is building a focused complementary services business that helps customers address their IT risk management challenges. By pulling together our portfolio products with services, we have the unique opportunity to assist our customers in an area of growing importance and complexity. ", "Now, let me spend a moment on our new Altiris business unit. I couldn't be more pleased with how the business unit and management team are integrating with the Symantec team. Last year, Dell launched a software management strategy based on an open platform, and they chose Altiris' unified architecture. This relationship remains quite strong and contributed meaningfully to the team's June quarter results. In addition, we're integrating and leveraging our technologies on several fronts. ", "For example, we developed a special connector that provides the ability for us to synchronize the database between Symantec endpoint protection and the Altiris configuration management database, helping to reduce the cost and complexity of software migration. This also provides an opportunity for us to upsell customers to our patch management solution by selling the Altiris client management suite, our total management suite. ", "Our consumer business posted another strong quarter of double-digit growth led by sales of Norton Internet Security. Growth was particularly strong in the Amaya region. Having experienced a full quarter of contribution from Norton 360 sales, we are now quite pleased with its initial uptake. Norton 360 has been the most successful consumer product launch in Symantec's history. Earlier this month, the consumer team launched another new product called Norton AntiBot. ", "According to our latest Internet security threat report, both-infected computers grew by 29% during the second half of 2006, to more than 6 million infected means. These bot's are covertly installed on users machines in order to allow an unauthorized user to control the computer remotely. ", "This allows a remote attacker to take control of a large number of compromised machines and create a bot network which can then be used to launch a coordinated attack. In addition, later this quarter, the consumer team will launch the new 2007 -- I'm sorry, 2008 versions of Norton Internet Security and Norton Antivirus. These products will look to continue our focus on delivering market leading functionality and further enhance the recognition of our Norton brand. ", "In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the past few quarters and believe many of the initiatives we implemented last year are beginning to bear fruit. With a solid first quarter behind us, we are well-positioned for the balance of fiscal 2008. We will continue to take steps to drive our competitive differentiation in the marketplace through continued new product innovation, improve our internal cost structure and improve our relationships with customers and partners around the world. And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to James. ", "James Beer", "Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. Solid performance in the June quarter is a good indication of the progress we are making towards our FY '08 targets. GAAP revenue for our June 2007 quarter was $1.4 billion. Non-GAAP revenue grew 10% versus the June 2006 period to $1.42 billion. As we did a good job of converting our sales activity into recognized revenue. Excluding the addition of the revenue we acquired from Altiris, non-GAAP revenue grew by 6% year-over-year. ", "Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP revenue by $38 million in the June 2007 quarter, as compared to June 2006. Sequentially, foreign currency movements had approximately a $15 million positive impact on revenue. The June quarter's diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.10. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.29, up 21% compared to the June 2006 results. This significant percentage increase is an illustration of the value we can create for our shareholders as a result of the substantial buyback activity totaling $7 billion in the last two years that we have completed. ", "International non-GAAP revenue for the June quarter grew 12% to $727 million, versus the year-ago period. And represented 51% of total non-GAAP revenue. The Europe, Middle East, Africa region grew 15% and Asia-Pacific, including Japan, grew 8%. The Americas grew 8% year-over-year, holding currency constant international revenue grew 7% year-over-year. ", "Now I'd like to move to revenue by segment in the June 2007 quarter. Consumer revenue generated $424 million, up 11% versus the June 2006 quarter. Electronic distribution channels represented 72% of consumer revenue and grew 19% versus the June 2006 quarter. Norton Internet Security revenue grew 31%, and remains the single largest product contributor to our consumer category, generating approximately 63% of consumer revenue. ", "Moving now to our enterprise segments, during the June 2007 quarter we defined the new Altiris business unit as made up of the acquired Altiris products plus our Ghost, pcAnywhere and LiveState Delivery products. These three products moved over from the Security and Data Management segment in order to enhance our go-to-market activities around endpoint management. We also moved our managed security services and deep-site business lines to the services segment from the Security and Data Management segment in order to create a single area of focus for our service-related activities. ", "In addition, following our ERP implementation during the December 2006 quarter, we completed an analysis of how maintenance revenues were being allocated among other enterprise segments. Maintenance analysis largely benefits the Data Center Management group so the offsetting detriment of the Security and Data Management segment. These initiatives have resulted in us recasting our segment data, both for this fiscal year and for the prior two fiscal years. We have provided historical comparative data for these reclassifications in the supplemental information which is posted on our investor relations Website. ", "The June quarter performance for the recasted segments is as follows. Our Security and Data Management revenue, $424 million, grew by 4% versus the June 2006 quarter. The Data Center Management group produced revenue of $404 million, and grew 5% from the year-ago period. And our services unit posted another strong performance, increasing revenue to $81 million, up 13% from the June 2006 quarter. ", "Services represented 6% of our total revenue during the June2007 quarter. The Altiris business unit, generated non-GAAP revenue of $89 million, of which the three Symantec products produced $36 million of the segment revenue, and the former Altiris products contributed the remaining $53 million. Altiris' non-GAAP revenue includes the impact of $16 million worth of deferred revenue lost on a GAAP basis as a result of the purchase accounting method related to the acquisition of Altiris. ", "Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 84.8% for the June 2007 quarter, compared to 83.9% for the year-ago period, driven by the divestiture last year of the Symantec-built appliances business, and by the movement of the consumer OEM fees from the cost of goods sold line to operating expenses, as we discussed on our May conference call. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $841 million for the June 2007 quarter, were flat sequentially, and up 16 % year-over-year. Expenses grew primarily due to three factors. ", "Altiris added $31 million, foreign exchange movements added $21 million, and the OEM issue I just mentioned added $42 million to our operating expense base. However, we were able to offset a portion of this expense growth by accelerating the pace of our cost-reduction activities ahead of plan this quarter. Therefore, operating expenses grew only 3% year-over-year after adjusting for exchange rates, OEM fees, and Altiris. GAAP net income was $95 million for the June 2007 quarter. Non-GAAP net income equaled $263 million, up nearly 4% as compared to June 2006. ", "Symantec adopted FIN48 the new standard related to Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes during the June 2007 quarter. As a result, we performed a comprehensive reevaluation of our tax risks which resulted in a net decrease to our tax reserves of $18 million. As a result, goodwill was reduced by $11 million, retained earnings increased by $6 million, and stockholders' equity increased by $1 million. Symantec exited June with a cash and short-term investments balance of $2 billion. ", "A decline of $953 million versus the end of the March quarter. The decline is attributable to our purchase of Altiris, which reduced our cash and short-term investment balance by $810 million, and our repurchase of $500 million of our outstanding shares. During the June quarter, we repurchased 25 million shares at an average price of $19.76. Our net accounts acceptable balance at the end of the June 2007 quarter was $569 million. Days sales outstanding or DSO, was 36 days in line with normal seasonally trends. Cash flow from operating activities for the June 2007 quarter is expected to be between 345 and $350 million. This is lower than our original expectation. ", "Year-over-year, our cash flow from operations were impacted by higher fees paid to consumer OEMs, and by the weakness in the Americas that John noted. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the June 2007 quarter was approximately $2.665 billion. Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $2.709 billion, up 16% compared to the June 2006 quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of the June quarter is typically lower than at the end of the March quarter, due to seasonally trends. In addition, deferred revenue was impacted by the stronger than expected recognized revenue yield that we generated during the June quarter. ", "Lastly, foreign exchange rates had a positive benefit on deferred revenue of approximately $61 million versus June 2006. During the September quarter we expect about $905 million of our non-GAAP deferred revenue balance to convert into recognized revenue. This is 7% higher than the equivalent June 2007 quarter amount, and 17% higher than the year-ago period. We continue to benefit from an increasing volume of predictable revenue rolling off the balance sheet driven by our deferred revenue model. ", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance. Given the current business environment and an exchange rate of $1.33 per, our forecast for the September quarter is as follows. GAAP revenue is estimated to be between 1.35 and $1.38 billion. Non-GAAP revenue is estimated to be between 1.37 and $1.4 billion. GAAP earnings per share are forecasted between $0.07 and $0.09. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated between $0.24 and $0.26. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $2.53 and $2.58 billion. ", "We expect non-GAAP deferred revenue to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.6 billion. The September quarter cash flow from operating activities is expected to be the lowest quarterly figure for the year, following normal seasonally patterns. September quarter operating cash flow is expected to be below the $276 million we recorded in the September 2006 quarter. The lower cash flow estimate is primarily due to the payment of higher consumer OEM fees year-over-year and to the weak Americas activity noted in the June quarter. ", "While we are pleased with our June quarter results and with the prospects for the September quarter, we plan to update our guidance one quarter at a time. We do not plan to revisit our full-year guidance until the beginning of the March quarter on our January earnings call. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions. ", "Helyn Corcos", "Thanks, James. Will you please begin polling for questions? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Helyn Corcos", "While Tom is polling for questions, I'd like to announce that Symantec plans to attend the Citigroup conference on September 6. We will be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on October 24. This information will also be posted on our events calendar on the Website. For a complete list of these events, please feel free to visit the investor relations Website. Tom, we're ready for our first question. ", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Banc. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hi guys, nice quarter. ", "John Thompson", "Thanks, Todd. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "So John, I just want to focus on the new desktop client you guys are about to ship, some of your competitors have been describing it as a forklift upgrade and in positioning it as a potential opportunity to take some shares from you guys. I have two questions. One, how do you see the profit in terms of upgrading the client, how challenging will it be for a customer to roll this out? And two, what do you think it potentially does to your growth profile of your Security and Data Management business? Should we see an acceleration as this product comes into the market? ", "John Thompson", "First off, you should not believe what competitors say about our technology. They have a agenda of their own which may not necessarily be consistent with what we intend to deliver. That said, we don't expect the new endpoint protection solution to be any more difficult to go from, let's say, version 9 to version 10 and in this case, version 10 to version 11. Clearly if you have a very large tens of thousand client network there is a significant amount of planning that goes on in that process. And we have a series of pools that we will deliver with both the endpoint product itself, and through our Altiris business unit that will help our customers through the migration process. So I think Dave and his team need to go find someplace else to play. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then the second part of my question in terms of should we see an acceleration as the product starts to hit the market? ", "John Thompson", "I don't think there's an acceleration that should be expected out of the chute. As you may recall, Todd, our customers take advantage of what we call upgrade insurance. So as the product is made available, they are entitled to the base product. Where the opportunity lies for us is in two places. First, in the network admission control component, which is a new modular that represents a net upsell opportunity and quite frankly for competitive take-outs where we think the combination of our Altiris capability and a much, much better client than is available currently in the marketplace certainly should give us great opportunities for revenue growth. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks guys, good quarter. ", "John Thompson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with UBS. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "John a couple questions, first you mentioned some changes in the Americas, I was wondering if you could comment about what changes you're making, if you could go into a little more detail. The second question is really for James, if you could update us on the new buyback initiative that you announced at the analyst day. Thank you. ", "John Thompson", "Heather, we made a change in the leadership at the top of the Americas organization as we started the September quarter. That change was precipitated by, quite frankly, our recognition that morale in the Americas team was declining, and attrition was rising. And we felt that we needed to make changes to address that right away and we did. We brought in a very, very experienced leader, one who's well-known to the Americas team, has led and produced terrific results for us in Asia-Pacific and we know that Bill Robins will get the Americas back on track. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Are there any account-level changes, though, when you say changes in the Americas, is it senior leadership or -- ", "John Thompson", "This is about senior leadership. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Not about the people covering the accounts? ", "John Thompson", "There are always account changes that go on all the time. That's kind of a normal part of running an enterprise sales force. We saw some instability in that regard in the western region in particular, but beyond that, I think this is just normal Q4 to Q1 kind of transition stuff that goes on. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Okay. And then just James on the buyback, please? ", "James Beer", "On the buyback, obviously in the June quarter we finished off the previous billion dollar buyback program completing $500 million of buyback activity. And so now we're pleased that our board announced the new $2 billion program that we discussed at the analyst day. Our thinking with regards to executing on the $2 billion program is much as was the case with the previous billion dollars program. We're going to be proceeding on an opportunistic basis. ", "Obviously, that makes it a very hard to necessarily predict with any precision the accretion dilution impact of the program. Obviously, it very much driven by, when you buy, at what price, and factors such as that. So I guess I would say that I've been a little bit surprised as to some of the estimates that I've seen out there as to how accretive this would be. Some of those estimates look a little high. ", "The other thing I would say about buybacks generally, is of course that we've got 7 billion done now over the last couple years and that was a big driver to that 21% EPS growth that we were able to record during the quarter. So it was good to see some of the fruits of that activity. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "So is there anything factored into the September quarter guidance, then, in terms of buybacks? ", "James Beer", "We're not offering specific direction. Our approach is that as we proceed through a quarter, we'll -- the end of that quarter, just provide everyone with status and so forth. So again, it will really be very much driven by how we roll out this opportunistic approach. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Great. Thank you. ", "James Beer", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Cowen. ", "Walter Pritchard, Cowen & Company", "Hi guys. I'm wondering if you can just talk a bit about the perpetual ratable mix or the in-period revenue, as you call it. What drove that during the quarter? I assume it was more license, less maintenance renewals and then also how that tied into the large deal count, was that part of the deal where you had large maintenance renewals in the year-ago period and you didn't see as much of that activity this year? ", "John Thompson", "I'll make comments and I'll let James talk. I think the real difference we saw this water was our channel-based business, particularly Backup Exec, did very, very well. That business had been significantly impacted by our ERP systems change that occurred right at the same time that we launched a new product. And so fundamentally, once the dust settled on our licensing portal and our new buying programs, what we saw was real strength in Backup Exec, which is a product that has the profound impact of being able to deliver great in-quarter revenue results as compared to some of the large deals that we do that tend to go to the balance sheet, if you will. What we saw in big deals was a decline in big deals, not so much in the context of maintenance deals, because most of those get booked in our fiscal third and fourth quarter, but we saw weakness in the Americas in particular, in large deal sizes, and we felt that some of that had to do with the stability or lack thereof of the team. And as I mentioned in Heather's question, we've taken action to fix that. ", "James Beer", "And the only thing I'd add, I was very pleased during the quarter with the degree of coordination between the folks in the sales force and everyone in the back office, if you will. I think we had a good execution quarter and that assisted us. Obviously, that's a trend we're very much working hard to continue. ", "Walter Pritchard, Cowen & Company", "Great. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Adam Holt with JP Morgan. ", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "Good afternoon. My first question is around the DCM business. The year-on-year growth was the best we've seen in a couple quarters. I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about what the drivers were there particularly given that the NetBackup 6.0 release is not in the market yet. Is it possible to give what the apples to apples growth rate would have been on the old accounting or segment definition? ", "John Thompson", "I don't have a clue, Adam, what it would be on an apples, to apples basis. I'll let Helyn and the team see if they can hundred with that at a later point. What did happen for DCMG this quarter is NetBackup 6.0 is a much more stable product now, and NetBackup 6.5 is clearly on path to be delivered here very shortly. But underpinning all of that was very strong performance in the Storage Foundation product family, that's what set the business up for 5% revenue growth. That said, we should lap the model change that we made in the DCMG business this quarter, so it's our expectation that we will see continued acceleration in DCMG's business as we move through the fiscal year. ", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "And I guess that leads me to my second question, which is around the deferred revenue guidance for the next quarter down sequentially, I just wanted to make sure I understood what sort of the thinking was around that. Does that mean that you're being a little bit more conservative with respect to larger deals that closed in the quarter or is it a function of the fact that you do expect more revenue to come off the balance sheet in-quarter? ", "James Beer", "Well, Adam, one of the charts you may recall that I showed at analyst day split the deferred revenue history over the last several quarters up into year halves, first half versus second half. That showed that we tended to have much less growth flat down a little bit between the first quarter and the second quarter, and then we would see stronger deferred revenue in the third and the fourth quarter. Now, of course we're starting off with a lower balance as a result of the activity that ended up in recognized revenue in the June quarter, and so I think those are the factors that have fed us through to the guidance that we've offered this afternoon. ", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "Terrific. Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Good Afternoon, guys, good quarter. Very nice bring back in your operating margins. Could you maybe give us an update on where we are in terms of your cost reduction activities? And in particular, is there still low-hanging fruit out there to get the organization back to those levels you were at a couple of years back? ", "John Thompson", "Well, I'd just say, as you are that we feel as though we're ahead of schedule with regard to our $200 million program that we announced back in January. So obviously that's been a lot of hard work by the team here. And we're going to stay very focused on operating margins, obviously. ", "James Beer", "I would also add, Sarah that the business today is a very different business than the one a few years ago when we had 30-plus point operating margins. That business was 50-plus percent to consumer with very, very high operating margin content, and that's not the way's the Company's is profiled today. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's fair enough. Then fixed just follow-up on your comment on NetBackup 6.5, similar to Todd's question around the endpoint 11.0 release, what is the upside potential there, John? Is it getting new customers, is it new add-on feature functionality that you can upsell? ", "John Thompson", "Well, the first upside opportunity is around what we all NAC or Network Admission Control. We have the market-leading product with the sigh gate solution, it will be much more tightly integrated and easy to install out of the box. So our expectation is that our sales teams and our channel partners will work very hard to upsell, if you will, base customers to the NAC solution. And beyond that, it's the opportunity to combine our Altiris team with our endpoint protection team to really go have a lot of fun with competitive take-outs. And so while some may view this as a forklift, we view this as an opportunity to stick a fork in a fat cat right here in the valley. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Let me leave it there because I was actually asking more around the NetBackup 6.5. ", "John Thompson", "Oh, NetBackup. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all excited about this, I can't help it. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "That's okay. ", "John Thompson", "NetBackup 6.5 is clearly a terrific upgrade from the 6.0 product. It includes our disk space backup capability and starts to move NetBackup to become a storage management platform, if you will. So rather than it just being a backup product, we will use it as the foundation to deliver a range of incremental services, if you will, into existing accounts. And I think the team has done a really nice job in the rearchitecture, if you will, of that product. ", "James Beer", "I think we got particularly warm reception at our vision user conference a month or so back to the news of 6.5 and its capabilities. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Terrific. Thanks a lot, guys. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ed Maguire with Merrill Lynch. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just comment on the trends in the consumer, whether you're seeing any impact from Vista and how the uptake has been so far on Norton 360 overall? ", "John Thompson", "Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, Ed, Norton 360 has been the single most successful product we ever launched in the consumer business out of the chute. Volumes have been just tremendous. And while Norton Internet Security continues to be the largest product revenue contributor, if you will, it, too, grew at 31% last quarter. So the business is performing quite well. On the Vista front, we think we saw in the June quarter activity that may have adversely affected our consumer business just a little bit around some of the Vista upgrade activity that -- and rebates that were going on in the marketplace. But that appears to have abated and the consumer business is doing quite well. But we're going to continue to watch our products are all Vista-compatible and are shipping, if you will, on the OEM machines that we have relationships with, but Vista is not a big revenue-based opportunity for us beyond any other windows platform, quite frankly. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And a follow-up for James. It looks like for your September quarter guidance here you're assuming a, I guess, a slightly higher operating run rate. Could you help us understand where you'd had some offsets in the first quarter, whether particularly on the OEM side, whether some of those may be continuing into the second quarter? ", "James Beer", "Yes, I would certainly expect the OEM costs to continue on into the second quarter. As you may recall, many of those contracts are now structured on a per-PC-per laptop shipped by the OEM. And I think you've seen quite a bit of strong data from the computer manufacturers as to demand for those types of products. So certainly I would expect that to continue on into the year. And obviously we're very focused and interested in what happens at the end of the 60-day trial that the customer has. And we're very busy in that regard. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tom Klasell with Thomas Weisel partners. ", "Tom Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I want to jump over to the consumer business, you mentioned a particular strength in Europe. Can you sort of walk us through that? Was there a particular product or just economic conditions improving over there? Or currency? Can you walk us through what's driving the business in Europe? ", "John Thompson", "Well, it was in reference to our consumer business, and I think the answer in Europe is better balance across all of the channels than we saw in any of the other regions. The retail channel for our EMEA team held up stronger if you will than the retail channel and other regions around the world. Online continues to be strong of us but it was the balance if you will that we saw in Europe that made the difference. ", "Tom Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, good. Then sort of a high-level question. With the consumer business appearing to be pretty steady, that does throw off a lot of cash like you mentioned earlier, have you guys given any further thought to capital structure? Obviously you guys have capacity to go to a more traditional large company capital structure. What's the thinking? ", "James Beer", "Yes, I wouldn't say that anything has changed in our thinking at all. Versus the comments that we've made in recent quarters. So we're being very thoughtful about that issue. Obviously, the markets have certainly become a bit choppier in recent days and weeks here so this is a topic that we spend a lot of time thinking about. ", "Tom Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Very good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question from Daniel Ives with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. ", "Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Can you talk about year-end guidance again in regards to not giving, I mean, are you like withdrawing the former guidance? How should we look at the year, especially just given the strength this quarter and the buyback? Can you just maybe speak to that anecdotally, as I know you're not giving guidance? ", "James Beer", "Yes, we're very much just taking the perspective that at the start of the year we'll outline to everyone our perspective on how the year could play out. And then we'll really focus our business, our efforts quarter-by-quarter and we feel as though it makes sense to give detailed guidance on a quarterly basis. So that's all it is. It's just a tuning of the philosophy as to what level volume of guidance we should be offering in the marketplace. ", "Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Okay. And to that point, so do you still maintain your year-end guidance that you gave on top and bottom line? Originally? ", "James Beer", "Well, you say a gain, just restate what I said. We issued that guidance this time, 90 days or so ago, and we are just going to leave it there. We wouldn't plan to update annual guidance one way or another. ", "Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Okay. ", "James Beer", "So that's the approach. ", "Daniel Ives - Friedman Billings Ramsey", "Thanks. Good quarter. Thanks. ", "James Beer", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse First Boston. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi guys, I just want to spend a little bit of time on the consumer side again, just wondering what trends you saw from a seasonality perspective during Q2 here. Obviously you've gone to more of a deferred model so it shows up more on the balance sheet, wondering if you could go trends there, any impact you think from Vista shipping earlier this year on customer buying patterns or is this sort of a typical June quarter? ", "John Thompson", "Well, I'd say this is a fairly typical June quarter for the consumer business. It is traditionally seasonally down in June. It starts to build momentum in the month of September based upon the shipment of new products that we make. And then it peaks in the fiscal third and fourth quarter for us. And so I don't think that we could point to anything that would say June was abnormal from a pattern point of view, normal pattern. And I'll stand on my comments of a bit ago, Phil, which is Vista is really not an event for us in the consumer markets. As the OEMs preload Vista on their machines, our business is to create a Vista-compatible product to go along with that. And we've done that. It's been in the marketplace since the OEMs have been shipping Vista. So there is no unique opportunity in the consumer segment driven by the Vista migration. There is; however, an opportunity for us in the mid market as we look at the combination of our Altiris products and the endpoint protection suite that we will be delivering. And we think, given the strength of Altiris in mid market activities, they're real strong relationship with many of the OEMs, that represents a unique opportunity for us around Vista that doesn't exist necessarily in the consumer segment. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great. And then James, as far as the September quarter, you discussed a little bit about the deferred revenue guidance being down sequentially. Is that related to any specific segment, consumer, Security and Data Management, et cetera? ", "James Beer", "No. It's really not. I'd say nothing unusual in that regard. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks guys. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Kevin Buttigieg with A.G. Edwards. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Just going back to the consumer business for a moment, now that you have a full quarter of Norton 360 behind you, I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there in terms of the dynamics, in terms of is the business attracting new customers to Symantec? Is it driving upgrades from Norton Internet Security or perhaps Norton Antivirus given the continuing declines in that business? And just sort of what -- you've talked in the past about the consumer business being a low double-digit type of growth business or a low teens type of growth business. Does the Norton 360 opportunity perhaps because of an ASP perspective or for new subscribers that you might get through it, influence that number to the positive? How should we think about revenue growth in the consumer business post-Norton 360? ", "John Thompson", "Well, we haven't given specific segment growth guidance for this year and we're not going to change that stance just because we're having great success with Norton 360. That said, what Norton 360 appears to be doing is taking some opportunity away from Norton Internet security, and upselling some customers from Norton antivirus. Both of which represent price up for us. Because the Norton 360 product is priced at a higher price point. So our sense is that this is the right way to have, if you will, good, better, best in the marketplace, and customers will choose the price point and the functional mix that they want. And as they move to higher function, we should yield higher average selling prices. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "And then any comment on in terms of new subscribers that you might be getting through -- ", "John Thompson", "No, we don't tend to talk about subscriber growth, that is not something that's a part of the way we manage our activities in the consumer business. Clearly, we monitor it and track it, but we don't disclose it. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "John Walsh from Citigroup. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. If you could talk about just the high level macro environment, what you see on the enterprise specifically North America versus Europe for the current quarter, and then what you saw last quarter? ", "John Thompson", "Well, I think our guidance reflects a sense of continued strength and momentum. If anything, slightly better performance in the Americas than we saw in the fiscal first quarter. Clearly our APJ business is doing very, very well. EMEA seems to be holding with Germany still an economic challenge but or business in Germany having stabilized quite a bit from what we saw over a year ago. Our issues now are focused on bringing our new Americas leader on board, making sure that he's got the right footing under him and the right set of metrics in place for how he wants to manage his team but he's off to a good start. Hopefully it will only improve from here. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Okay. On the consumer side, any pushback you're hearing from the channel or from consumers about the auto renewal feature? ", "John Thompson", "No, not at all. ", "John Walsh - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Good afternoon. I wanted to focus a little bit on pricing within the enterprise security market. On 10.2, I believe you guys raised price, I'm curious what the customer response has been, have you seen any pushback on that front? ", "John Thompson", "Quite frankly, I can't say that I have. I mean clearly our challenge right now is to get 11.0 out the door, and to get it seated into the marketplace. And that's where the team is very, very much focused. Our expecting is that it should be a fairly rapid uptake for current users of Symantec 10.0 or prior releases and we'll see whether or not we can upsell, therefore, get some price yield on the Mac solutions or some of the competitive take-out programs we have planned. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "With regard to that recent price increase, how should we think about growth as a function of that? Should that begin to impact that security line as we move throughout the remainder of fiscal 2008, just as a function of most revenue being deferred? ", "John Thompson", "We have not given segment-specific growth guidance for this year. Our expectation; however, is that all of our businesses have been planned for growth and we would expect to see a continuation in momentum building in the SDAMG team as well. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Katherine Egbert with Jeffries. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Hi, I just have a quick question about guidance, you guys have done a really nice job the last quarters, reporting upside, now your saying you're not going to be giving annual guidance. There's been a formulation change in the last few quarters regarding the way you do guidance which made you more focused on short-term? ", "James Beer", "Well, again, I mean I wouldn't characterize it as we're not giving annual guidance, we are going to give annual guidance, we just give it at the start of the year. So hopefully that, in combination with our quarterly updates to the coming quarter will give a lot of information to the marketplace, perhaps quite a bit more than some other companies offer these days. ", "John Thompson", "There appears to be a fair amount of short-term focus amongst many of our investors as well. And so focusing on what we can deliver next quarter is very much responding to what we perceive to be the short-term interest of some of our investors as well. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Okay. Thanks for that. And one quick one, what do you make of Google buying post Genie, do you see that as a competitive threat? ", "John Thompson", "We don't offer per se a hosted mail service. We have a partnership through a firm called MX Logics that does offer our AntiSpam solution through their hosted mail service. We're not completely sure of what Google's intent might be there. We view that it's much more focused on the aggregate issue of Google Apps, not just hosted mail. And mail is just one of an array of things that they will offer through their Google Apps service. So we'll obviously monitor this quite closely. Our Symantec protection network does have plans to deliver this fiscal year a series of hosted services some that may ultimately compete with what Google's plans might be. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Thank you, John. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Shaul Eyal with CIBC World Markets. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Good afternoon, good quarter. A quick question, since you talked before on the ASP trends, as you look into the consumer business, security data management and kind of the DCM business, were the majority of ASP interest being generated from, any particular segment? ", "James Beer", "Well, I wouldn't get into specifics as to ASP by business unit, I'd echo John's earlier comments on the consumer side where we've seen a variety of new products over the last year or so that are going nicely at higher ASPs. In the enterprise side of the house, obviously, pricing becomes more complicated deal-by-deal and so forth to talk about it in any particular generalities. But it's fair to say we're quite satisfied with the overall direction here. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "All right. Fair enough. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brian feed with Morgan Keegan. ", "Brain Freed - Morgan Keegan", "Hi guys, great quarter. Real quick with two major products beginning shipping this quarter, 6.5 and Hamlet, how have you guys within the sales organization accounted for potential of purchasing freeze ahead of deployment and dealing with the test and eval cycles for those? Is it a function of large beta programs in place or can you comment a little more on that? ", "John Thompson", "Well, we've certainly had a beta program in place for both of these offerings, we've used the feedback from that beta program not just to enhance the product itself, but to reflect that in our marketing messaging to reflect that in our services strategy, to reflect that in the advice and counsel that we give our partners as they go to move these products in the marketplace. Our forecast reflects our view of how those products will do this quarter. And as we see their performance in the marketplace, we'll update our guidance a quarter at a time, and hopefully it will reflect better than anticipated or expected results from both 6.5 and Sef11. ", "Helyn Corcos", "We have time for one more question. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Rueppel with Wachovia Securities. ", "Phillip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", "Thanks very much. Quickly, if you could drill down a little bit on the Backup Exec strength, you talked about the convergence of the new product and the ERP issue. Was the strength a flush of the pinup demand or could you see that carrying through continued growth going forward much as your commentary about NetBackup would be with its new product release? Thanks. ", "John Thompson", "Actually it was not a flush, business in the mid market for that kind of market tends to be perishable if you're not there on the shelf and available. They pick someone else's. So it's not a function of there was this bubble of opportunity that was waiting for us to clear up our licensing portal. To the contrary. We have reflected in our forecast a view that there's likely to be some continued strength in that product as we look at this quarter. Because the 11B product is a very, very strong product. It's doing well in all channels in all markets, and I think we can continue to bill momentum there for sure -- build momentum there for sure. ", "Phillip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", "Great, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "That does conclude or question-and-answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Thompson for closing remarks. ", "John Thompson", "Thank you very much for dialing in. We're awfully pleased with our team's performance in the fiscal first quarter of '08. We're off to a good start. It's one solid quarter and we're focused on the next. Thank you very much for calling.

Our team\u2019s performance during the fiscalsecond quarter demonstrated solid execution against our four key financialmetrics: revenue, EPS, deferred revenue and operating cash flow. As we continueour focus on improving the operational efficiencies of our company, we continueto see higher in-period revenue contributions from key product innovations.These efforts have the obvious offset in deferred revenue as we recognize agreater portion of revenue in the period. ", "In addition, last year's shift in our business model drove agreater portion of our sales activity to the balance sheet as deferred revenue.Therefore, this year we were able to recognize an increasing amount of revenueoff the balance sheet.", "Performance for the September quarter was driven by twofactors: we experienced strong demand in our emerging enterprise technologies,specifically end point management, our compliance solutions and EnterpriseVault. Some of our core products such as Backup Exec and Consumer Protectionproduced strong results. ", "While our first half performance has been solid, exceeding ouroperating plan in both quarters for revenue, EPS and cash flow from operations,we have not met our planned new business targets. As you may recall, our North America operations experienced weak new business generation in theJune quarter. While we saw solid sequential improvements in the Americas,we remain cautious about the business outlook. This, coupled with the uncertaineconomic environment, causes us to take a more conservative view of theDecember quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. ", "We continue to optimize our sales leadership team around theglobe to improve execution. In addition, we are taking several actions to drivenew business growth during the second half of the year:", "First, we've initiated new sales incentives in North America to create more excitement within the salesforce. ", "Second, we continue to make operational improvements to makedoing business with Symantec much easier for our customers and more productivefor our team.

", "In addition to these initiatives, we will continue ourstrong focus on controlling our costs with specific targets for each operatingunit for the second half of the fiscal year. ", "Earlier this year, we started an active review of ourproduct portfolio to ensure many of the investments made over the years aremeeting our return expectations. During the September quarter we identified somenon-strategic assets in the Data Center Management Group that have not metthose expectations. As a result, we are taking an $87 million writedown of someassets in the data center management group acquired by Veritas during the 2003/2004timeframe. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensurethat we focus our investment efforts on a few key strategic areas that drivelong-term revenue growth. ", "Now I'd like to highlight a few items from the quarter. Oneof the largest growth drivers over the next 12 months will be the two majorproduct upgrade cycles that we are just beginning in the areas of enterpriseprotection and enterprise backup. We are encouraged by the prospects forSymantec Endpoint Protection 11.0. This is the first truly integrated single-agentendpoint security product that incorporates a strong compliance function. ", "We garnered several early customer wins during the Septemberquarter. One large multi-million dollar displacement occurred with a Europeanpower company that has over 100,000 laptops and desktops, in addition tothousands of servers. Symantec's Network Access Control feature will be deployedon tens of thousands of laptops where we will displace McAfee in the account. ", "This customer valued our multilayer solution with acentralized management console managing all components, including a strong personalfirewall.

And, Norton InternetSecurity 2008 has a set of new features including stronger protection against web-basedattacks, as well as password and identity management tools. PC Magazine recentlyawarded NIS the Editor\u2019s Choiceaward again this year which represents the sixth win over the last seven years.", "Looking at the business from a broader perspective, webelieve long-term growth for our company will be driven by our customers\u2019desire to address the growing cost and complexity challenges associated withmanaging and securing their systems environments. In doing so, we can also helpthem meet the added challenge of ensuring compliance within the overall ITinfrastructure. ", "Specifically, we think we are well positioned to address twohigh growth areas that customers are prioritizing in the coming 12 -24 months.These include systems and application virtualization and data loss prevention. ", "As some have noted, virtualization may be the biggestdisruptor of data center technologies over the next few years. Servervirtualization is being adopted rapidly by large enterprises to drive higherutilization rates and reduce hardware costs. ", "It\u2019s clear to us that virtualization also brings a bigopportunity to Symantec. As customers start to deploy virtualizationtechnologies in their production and mission-critical environments, complexitywill rise as they work to manage both the physical and virtual environmentsdelivered from many different vendors. This in turn will create a greater needfor sophisticated device and application management tools, as well as strongdata- protection tools.

We have also partneredwith Intel to deliver new security and management solutions designed to work onIntel\u2019s vPro platform. ", "Another area of growing interest for our customers is DataLoss Prevention or DLP. There has been some recent speculation about ourintentions in this space. Suffice it to say, it\u2019s an important area for ourcustomers and we have a very strong sense of how the technology solutions willevolve in this area. We believe that true DLP solutions require the layering oftechnologies in a similar manner as malicious code detection has evolved. Nosingle technology addresses all of the requirements of a true DLP solution. ", "The reason this market is growing so rapidly is becausenearly all corporate information exists in electronic form. Additionally,companies are opening up their infrastructure to enable new collaboration,providing employees, partners and customers with more access to moreinformation. ", "At the same time, threats are proliferating from bothexternal and internal sources making information not just a critical asset butalso a potential liability. We believe a more policy driven and informationcentric approach to security is essential in today\u2019s information intensiveenvironment. ", "Data loss prevention solutions help organizations controlthe flow of sensitive information, whether that information is in-motion on thenetwork, in-use at the device endpoint or at-rest within an organization\u2019s ITinfrastructure. ", "Over the past several years we have been addingcomplementary DLP technologies to our compliance, messaging security andarchiving products through a number of important acquisitions. ", " We also continue todevelop our own technology with our recent introduction of new or upgradedproducts that assist with data loss prevention. For instance, the integrated applicationand device control capabilities within Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 can helpprevent data loss by enforcing policies and controls around the use of certain applicationsand disabling the use of USB ports. ", "Our newest version of Symantec Database Security, which wasannounced earlier this week, helps companies reduce the risk of losingsensitive information from backend databases by providing greater control overdatabase traffic and insight into suspicious activity. ", " So, in conclusion,September was a solid quarter. And, while our over performance on revenue andEPS in the first half of the fiscal year could easily lead one to be verybullish for the remainder of the year, our lighter than expected new businessgeneration and an uncertain economic environment leads us to be cautiouslyoptimistic. ", "We are encouraged by the much improved execution of our teamin the September quarter. But, we know we have much more work to do. We areexcited about our recent product launches and are focusing our marketingefforts on demand creation. Overall, we believe that we are strengthening ourposition with both our enterprise and our consumer customers. ", " And with that, I\u2019dlike to hand the call to James. ", "James Beer ", " I am pleased toreport that our September quarter results delivered on each of our four primaryfinancial metrics. As we outlined at our analyst day in June, we measure the strengthof our business by looking at the combined results of revenue, deferredrevenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. ", " As we\u2019ve previouslydiscussed, last year\u2019s shift in our business model drove a greater portion ofour sales activity to the balance sheet as deferred revenue. This year, therefore,we are able to recognize an increasing amount of revenue off the balance sheet.", "In addition, our continued focus on operational executionhas contributed to us being able to recognize a greater portion of our salesactivity as revenue in the period. ", "It is also important to note that while our sales activityfor the business remains seasonal, we are now seeing that the business modelshift coupled with the focus on operational execution is having the effect ofsomewhat smoothing out our revenue and earnings performance. This has resultedin our revenue and earnings for the first half of the fiscal year accountingfor approximately 50% of our full year forecast, as opposed to the traditionalsplit of 45% versus 55% for the front versus back half of the year.

However, we did see in the September quarter some of the mid-marketcustomers pause or slow their purchasing decisions. We saw transactions that wehad originally thought might occur in the September quarter shift to December-- or at least shift out of the quarter -- and that certainly would give uscause for pause.

We talked about 90 days ago about the fact that we are not going to beupdating annual guidance each quarter by quarter.  I won't go into any great specifics on thattrack. Obviously we are pleased that we are able to exceed our expectations forcash flow during the September quarter and yet we have, I think, appropriatelyguided that we are expecting cash flow to be down below last year's Decemberquarter, particularly driven by the increase in the OEM consumer fees that weare now incurring. ", "We think that those fees will be a good investment over thelonger run but that there is a timing issue between when the cash is physicallypaid to the OEM and when we see cash coming in from our subscribers.", "Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS", "James, it's Heather, sorry we are jumping in between conferencecalls here, but just to ask on that question in particular, how much did thatimpact you this quarter, the timing of the OEM contract that you're referringto?

That was reflective of continued growth in that figurequarter on quarter.", "John Thompson", "Heather, I think we are on track to deliver strong operatingmargin performance this year ex some of the incremental things we added likeAltiris or like the OEM fees. That being said, however, we have issued costtargets for the second half of the year that we would expect our team to makein light of lighter new business generation in the first half that will yieldslightly lower revenue than we might have assumed, if you will, for the secondhalf of the year. ", "So we are going to continue to put cost items on the agendauntil we see new business generation equal our plan levels, because that's theway we will deliver the operating margin expansion or the EPS results that wehave forecasted.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - CreditSuisse", "I just wondered if I can get some clarification on yourcomment that the revenues for the fiscal year will be split more 50-50? Thatwould almost imply that revenues for the next two quarters are basically flatif not down slightly from what you did in September.", "Also tying that with your guidance for deferred revenue tobe up, it just seems to be a mismatch there in my mind. From a deferred revenuestandpoint, I wonder if you can give a sense of possibly what you would for theMarch quarter?", "James Beer", "Well we are not again to be talking about the March quarteron this call again. We will offer guidance one quarter at a time. Myobservation about the first half versus second half being 50-50 approximatelyon revenue EPS is exactly that. It's approximately. So I don't want you to readtoo much specifically into those words. ", "In terms of deferred revenue, the fact that we see thatgrowing in the back half of the year is very typical for our business. Wetended to see relatively flat to down deferred revenue depending upon the yearin those first couple of quarters, and then when we have the bigger renewalquarters in December and March, we tend to see deferred revenue increasing moresharply.  I would expect that to be thecase this year.", "Phil Winslow - CreditSuisse", "When you talk about the softness in new business, can you bespecific to Data Center Management or just where that was located?", "John Thompson", "  think in our SDMG, our Security and DataManagement business, it would be obvious to you, Phil, that there would be somesoftness ahead of the release of Symantec Endpoint Protection. That's been theexperience that we've had for the last few quarters and we finally have theproduct out and so our hope is that the trends that we've seen in the earlyparts of this quarter will continue throughout the quarter, or better yet,throughout the fiscal year. ", "In SDMG,the Net Backup was strong from a revenue point of view. However, new licensesales for a number of Data Center Management Group products was a little bitweaker than our forecast and hopefully as we re-incent and refocus the team inthe Americas, which is the largest part, if will, of our sales channel,that will bode well not just for SDMG but for our Data Center Management Groupas well.", "Operator", " Your next questioncomes from Walter Pritchard - Cowen.", "Walter Pritchard \u2013Cowen", "In terms of the EPS range for the December quarter, it's alot broader than you've provided over the last several quarters. I waswondering, James,  what the major factorsare outside of the revenue range that you have out there in terms of that EPSrange?", "James Beer", "Well, it's largely driven by the revenue range becauseobviously expenses are easier to predict. We've got very specific plans inplace as John was alluding to earlier on the expense side of the ledger versustrying to predict exactly how recognized revenue will play out. That'sobviously more driven by specific sales and activity, how we wrote up, if willyou, that sales activity. That's been a point that has definitely helped us Iwould say in the first half of the year. We've been able to convert more of oursales activity into recognized revenue in period, in both the September andJune quarters. So that's been a big part as to why we've exceeded our guidancein those two past quarters. ", "I'm certainly encouraged by that because I think that is illustrativeof how within our organization we are working very well right from the personon the front line doing the selling through sales management all the waythrough to the back office. So I think that's a very encouraging theme.", "Walter Pritchard \u2013Cowen", "Just to follow up on that topic, around the composition ofdeferred revenue you've talked traditionally about a 60/40 mix between yourenterprise and consumer. Could you update that for us given that it appears asthough the consumer deferred dynamic hasn't changed much but it's really beenthe enterprise side that has.", "James Beer", "I think directionally I would stand by our earlierdiscussions. I wouldn't say that anything has materially changed in thatregard. ", "Certainly to follow up on my earlier points, as you'rebuilding more in period recognized revenue then, yes, you are going to bebuilding a little less deferred revenue on the enterprise side of the equation.So to some extent there,  the balancefavors the consumer side as a result. But I would not want to overstate thatimpact, frankly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert - Jefferies& Company.", "George Roberts for KatherineEgbert - Jefferies & Company", "I was hoping I could get your early impressions on theBackup install base [inaudible] update? I know you spoke to it a little bit,but more broadly?", "John Thompson", " ", "Well, it's still quite early. The product was only released atthe end of September so it would be way, way, way too premature to talk aboutits update given what we've seen so far. ", "However, the one transaction that I did reference in myplanned comments was one where NAC was a part of the deal. They will deploy theNAC function on all of the laptop machines that are part of that environmentwhich represents about one-third of the 100,000 machines or so. So I think NAC,coupled with the enhanced management capabilities associated with Symantec EndpointProtection will be a great driver of additional momentum in our securitybusiness.", "George Roberts for KatherineEgbert - Jefferies & Company", "Did any of those slipped Altiris deals close after the quarter?", "John Thompson", " Quite frankly, Idon\u2019t know. I haven't even looked.", "James Beer", " I think it's fair tosay that some portion of them have, and obviously we are going to continue tobuild on the momentum that we have developed at Altiris in the last couple ofquarters. So we are very pleased by how that part of the organization isdeveloping and we are seeing, as we expected to, that there will be realopportunities for the Altiris product suite, particularly internationallyacross the EMEA region and across the Pacific so we will be very much focusedon that as the quarter plays out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Breza - RBC CapitalMarkets.", "Robert Breza - RBCCapital Markets", " First let me apologizefor the background noise, I am in the airport. John, I was wondering if you couldtalk about some of the writedowns or the writeoff of products? In what specificareas there? Do you look at taking a strategic look at all the products thatyou have in your portfolio? Thanks.", "John Thompson", "Well, we go through that analysis once a year, as a matterof practice. In this particular instance, we started the activity early thisyear and concluded that we did have some assets that were not major products likeNet Backup or Storage Foundation or what have you that are part of the DataCenter Management Group that just aren't as strategic today as they may havebeen some time ago. We are in discussions with people about alternatives forthose assets and therefore I'd rather not talk about the specific names beforewe talk to our customers about it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Turits - RaymondJames.", "Michael Turits -Raymond James", "On the SDM Group it was up mid to high single-digits, but inNet Backup it was actually up double-digits. It implies that enterprisesecurity was flat, possibly down. With Symantec Endpoint Protection coming on,does it look to you like you will have a chance to get the security piece ofenterprise either flat or growing? What do you think would be the specificdrivers for that?", "John Thompson", "Well, the strength of SDMG\u2019s performance this past quarterwas clearly Backup Exec. In addition to that, we had very strong contributionsfrom our compliance technologies and our enterprise vault or archivingtechnologies. So it's not just the backup business that's doing well. Many ofthe emerging technologies are doing quite well and we are encouraged by that. ", "However, the largest revenue stream in that BU or business unitis in fact the Endpoint Protection technologies and with SEP in the marketplacenow, that should start to improve the performance of that set of products orthat business area within SDMG. ", "We don't give specific product forecast or revenue outlooksbut suffice it to say now that we no longer have the headwind of no product inthe marketplace that should bode well for this whole business unit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Ashley - Robert W.Baird.", "Steve Ashley - RobertW. Baird", "First a quick housekeeping question, James. How much was theforeign tax refund in the period that benefited cash flow from operations?", "James Beer", "We actually had a few different tax refunds that all came inroughly around the same time, either from Asia, Europe or some of the U.S. States.When you added it all together it was on the order of $50 million.", "Steve Ashley - RobertW. Baird", "I know it hasn't been in the market very long, but InformationFoundation, can you comment on how the initial or early response has been tothat product?", "John Thompson", "It is early, but it is a part of a collection of technologiesfocused on helping customers manage the digital content that they have createdor they own, if you will, more effectively. So it's our mail security products,it's our archiving products. It's a full range of things like that. But the sub-segmentof products did very, very well in the quarter. I won't give you specificrevenue performance, but let's just say that we are pleased with what Francis andhis team are doing. They are doing a really great job.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Ives \u2013 FBR.", "Daniel Ives \u2013 FBR", "John, I just have a question in regards to guidance. Howmuch comes into play, there have been false starts before where you have a goodstring of quarters, bullish on The Street and then you have missed numbers. Areyou trying to bake in some breathing room here, thinking people were getting alittle too bullish and the fact that you are still a transition story?", "Could you talk about that with regard to what has happenedin the past, and has that played into your guidance for next quarter? Thanks.", "John Thompson", "I don't want to keep describing or defining Symantec as atransition story, but I also don't want people to get overly excited about thefirst half and drive up the outlook for the second half beyond what we thinkare reasonable expectations for our company in an economic environment, quitefrankly, that's quite uncertain. ", "So given some of the things that we have seen, given whatwe've seen from other companies that have a pretty good pulse on the globaleconomic environment, we thought it would be prudent to be a bit moreconservative, perhaps, and not let estimates run away from us. ", "Now that's certainly going to cause people to question thestrength of our business. We are quite pleased with how our business isperforming but we don't want estimates to get too far out ahead of us.", "Daniel Ives \u2013 FBR", "As a follow up, when you look at your business, is there anythingstructurally wrong with your company right now? I mean, you have been doingwell. Anything that should cause investors concern, given the outlook, or is itjust more a speed bump given the cautious environment?", "Can you address that on the call rather than investorshaving to think about it tomorrow? Thanks.", "John Thompson", "I don\u2019t think we have anything that is structurallywrong.  Do we have things that we want tocontinue to do to improve overall business operations? Absolutely. We have madegreat progress in a number of the things that have made doing business withSymantec much easier than it was a quarter ago or even a year ago.", "I think we also have made progress and turned the corner onour customer sat scores, that is an important indicator of what futureperformance might be for our company; and I think we have more work to do onour cost structure. That is not where we are going to take a hatchet to thecompany, we do need to take a scaffold, though, to certain areas of the companywhere we think we have allowed ourselves to get a little ahead of either therevenue performance or the operating return expectations that we have for thatbusiness segment.", "Those are modest tweaks that we will make along the way, notmajor structural changes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Klasell \u2013 Thomas WeiselPartners.", "Tim Klasell \u2013 ThomasWeisel Partners", "I want to dig into a little bit of your North American salesforce. You mentioned you made progress. Howmuch longer will it take for you to completely reorganize your salesforce andhave that totally behind you, do you think?", "John Thompson", "This was not about a salesforce reorganization, let me beclear. This was about making leadership changes at the top of the organizationto make sure that we had the right focus on execution day in and day out. Itwas about streamlining the leadership of the organization such that we didn'thave to go so many places to get so many things done. So we've made decisionmaking-- hopefully by the structural changes -- a lot easier and a lot faster andwe've got a leader in place that is well respected by the team across the Americas.", "So this is not we are reorganizing the salesforce, puttingnew quotas out, this is not that. This is let's make it easier for our team toexecute, let's get an enhanced set of incentives in front of them so they willsell their way out of what was a tough first quarter and we can then start tofeel good about performance as we wind down this fiscal year and head into thenext one.", "Tim Klasell \u2013 ThomasWeisel Partners", "Would you say that the leadership changes are pretty muchbehind you at this point?", "John Thompson", "I think that's a fair characterization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - PacificCrest Securities", "John, I was wondering if you could give us a little morecolor around your commentary around the SDMG group and Hamlet. Are youexpecting a big attach rate of the NAC products? You talked about this being anupgrade cycle and my understanding of Hamlet being free to customers onmaintenance, I was wondering how that is going to drive growth?", "John Thompson", "Actually where you get growth, Rob,  is in the mid-market for un-penetratedmachines or new machines that they add. But fundamentally for any of ourcustomers who are on maintenance, it is a free upgrade to them. They have topay, however, for the NAC component. We've seen tremendous interest through thebeta customers and in the early proof of concept if you will, for some of the largeenterprise customers that we've been with. We think over time NAC will be arevenue add for the SDMG business but that's not a huge, huge lift in thecurrent fiscal year for sure.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Phil Rueppel - Wachovia.", "Analyst for PhilRueppel \u2013 Wachovia", "Would you expect seasonality to come back to historicallevels as you look out to March?", "John Thompson", "We think as we have tuned the business model of the companyto where more and more of our revenue is rolling from the balance sheet, itshould make us more predictable and it should smooth results. ", "Now will it be a perfect 50-50? Probably not. But hopefullyit wouldn't be skewed as dramatically as it has historically been. I think thevalue of changes that we have either incurred or endured here is that we shouldproduce in the end a much more predictably consistent company and that's whatwe want, and we know that's what you want.", "Operator", "That is all the time we do have for the question-and-answersession.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Helyn Corcos.  Please go ahead.  ", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.  With me today are John Thompson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec, Enrique Salem, Chief Operating Officer, and James Beer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  In a moment I will turn the call over to John.  He will provide high level comments on our fiscal third quarter results which ended December 28, 2007.  Then Enrique will discuss more specific details of the quarterly results, then James will review the financial details and discuss our guidance as outlined in the press release.  This will be followed by a question and answer session.", "Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec\u2019s Investor Relations homepage.  A copy of today\u2019s press release and supplemental financial information are also available on our website along with prepared comments which will be available on the website shortly after the call is completely.", "Before we begin I\u2019d like to remind everyone that some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and stock based compensation for the coming quarter contains forward-looking statements.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company\u2019s most recent periodic reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results.  Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results which can be found in the press release and on our website.", "Now I would like to introduce you to our CEO, Mr. John Thompson.", "John W. Thompson", "Thanks, Helyn.  I am very pleased with the strength of our business and with the solid execution of our team during the December quarter.  Strong sales performance in EMEA and APJ coupled with continuing improvements in the Americas operation drove the overperformance for our company.  In addition, there were a number of key product areas that delivered strong double digit growth, including email archiving, messaging, compliance, and our Windows-based backup solutions.  While we can\u2019t forecast the economic environment, we are confident in the strength of our portfolio.  Security and storage management solutions continue to be top spending priorities for our customers.  Furthermore, based on customer surveys, key purchase areas for the coming year also include solutions that address regulatory compliance, virtualization, and enterprise message management, including archiving and data loss prevention.  We are very well positioned to capitalize on these growth trends.  ", "The near term catalyst that should drive attractive growth prospects for Symantec include the continuation of the market momentum we\u2019ve established with core products like BackUp Exec, Enterprise Vault, and Symantec End Point Protection.  Furthermore, our broad international exposure and our strength in key buyer segments like SME should prove to be important for us as well.  I\u2019m confident of our business and our building momentum as we head into our fiscal fourth quarter.", "Symantec has long focused on relevant IT trends in order to drive sustainable growth.  These trends include optimizing existing infrastructure and lowering cost for enterprise customers.  In addition, the evolving threat landscape compounds the growing problem of complexity and risk.  The recent information security breaches in the UK and here in the US point to failures in the development and implementation of appropriate security policies.  These incidents validate our view that a security strategy must be policy driven, information centric, and operationalized across a well-managed infrastructure.", "Our customers face an enormous challenge in integrating all the components they must acquire to ensure they\u2019re appropriately managing their information assets.  Our broad portfolio of products and services, coupled with a clear strategy for product integration, should make this task much easier for them, particularly those in the mid market.  For example, the tighter integration of Altiris with backup and system recovery functions as well as with end point protection should make the process of securing and managing their information much easier and provide real market differentiation for us.  ", "As I mentioned last quarter, we started an active review of our product portfolio to ensure many of the investments made over the years are meeting both our customers\u2019 needs and our financial expectations.  As a result, last week we announced an agreement to divest our application performance management business.  We determined that our customers would be better served by creating a standalone company dedicated to providing the investment required to develop innovative products.  We will continue to support our customers for a period of time as they transition to the new company and its support operation.  Through this product portfolio process, we expect to eliminate or harvest lower growth businesses or products with lower operating returns than we think are appropriate for our company.  As a natural byproduct of this process, many of the higher growth areas we\u2019ve been investing in will become much more visible to investors.  We expect this process to be ongoing and is squarely focused on driving growth and stronger operating returns.", "During the December quarter we closed the VonTu acquisition.  VonTu has maintained its competitiveness and market momentum across a broad range of industries including retail, health care, energy, and utilities, and had record bookings for the quarter.  VonTu expands our presence in the rapidly growing data loss prevention market with clear market leadership functionality.  In December the VonTu team released Data Loss Prevention 8, the industry\u2019s first integrated solution that combines end point and network based technology to prevent the loss of confidential data wherever it is used or stored.  Earlier this month, Infoworld recognized them as the best DLP solution for the third straight year.  ", "Going forward, we see excellent opportunities to broaden the distribution of the VonTu products, particularly in the international markets, and to integrate it with several of our key products, including Symantec end point protection, our mail security appliances, Enterprise Vault, and our storage products, further differentiating Symantec from the competition.  The early synergies in both product development and sales from Altiris and VonTu have been encouraging as they help to underpin new growth initiatives for our company.  It\u2019s my belief that these types of acquisitions should add new top line growth for Symantec and help improve our operating returns.  I would expect us to continue to look for acquisitions that drive revenue growth and enhance our net income.  In addition, just like Altiris and VonTu, they will add highly focused teams with great technology and strong customer relationships.  ", "Just a few weeks ago we announced a number of important organizational changes with an eye towards optimizing our diverse portfolio of products and ensuring we get better leverage from the investments we are making in people and technology across our company.  Specifically, we created the new role of Chief Strategy Officer, which integrates the corporate strategy and M&A functions under one leader in order to bring a heightened level of focus on our overall product portfolio and our growth prospects.  This new team will focus on ensuring the overall company is investing and managing the business for sustainable growth and profitability.  It places greater emphasis on optimizing the company and not a particular business unit or product area.  In addition, the Chief Strategy Officer will lead the charge for our investments in emerging growth areas like the creation of the Symantec Protection Network which will serve as the basis for our software and service platform.  The strategy team will play a vital role in our ability to identify and invest in new business models and go to market strategies.  ", "Secondly, we announced the appointment of a Chief Operating Officer to help drive operational consistency across the company and deliver more predictable results.  While it\u2019s not a new role for Symantec, I felt the diversity of our portfolio and the breadth of our global business operations warranted that we revisit an operating model that had proven to be successful for us in the past. Moreover, we should be able to achieve greater leverage from our broad portfolio of technology and services while ensuring our field sales and services teams are ready to execute on current and new product initiatives.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our new Chief Operating Officer, Enrique Salem, who will provide more detail on December quarter highlights.", "Enrique Salem", "Thanks, John.  First of all I want to say how excited I am to be given this opportunity.  My focus will be to drive consistency across the company and improve our ability to deliver top line growth.  I\u2019m highly confident we can maximize our potential and provide the best solutions and values to our customers.  As you know we\u2019ve made significant changes to the enterprise sales organization and I\u2019m pleased to report that these changes helped lead us to greater operational improvements in the quarter.  During the fiscal 2008 the sales compensation model was modified to emphasize new license sales with our specialist teams. We are pleased with the results to date as I believe that our new license sales have seen a benefit from this change.", "Our current geography leaders have done a tremendous job with their respective sales organizations, leading to improved sales execution. Our immediate team posted double digit growth with all subregions performing solidly.  We are particularly impressed wit h the immediate team\u2019s ability to increase the number of big deal transactions by 100% over the last year.  In APJ, the leadership changes have gone smoothly as the region continued to post strong numbers and importantly, sales execution in the Americas continues to show solid progress.  ", "On the product side, the new competitive functionality in our core products coupled with improved quality gives me tremendous confidence about our growth prospects.  Looking ahead, I believe we have built a strong pipeline going into our fiscal fourth quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to discuss a few of the highlights from the December quarter.  While still early in the customer adoption cycle, Symantec End Point Protection 11 has gotten off to a solid start.  This product has already received some of the best evaluations and reviews from the industry.  Information Security Magazine tested 8 end point security solutions from all the major security vendors and ranked Symantec the best overall for our manageability and component integration.  Our nearest competitor received the lowest grade in the manageability category, the single most important category for our enterprise customers.  In a separate review, PC Magazine calls SEP 11 the most comprehensive centrally managed end point security solution for businesses and gave it its coveted Editors Choice Award. ", "The Symantec network access control component of SEP 11 also known as SNACC is testing well.  In an assessment by Network World, Symantec ranked as number one as the best all around all-in-one NACC product in a test of 13 products from companies like Cisco, Juniper, Checkpoint, and McAfee among many others.  More importantly, customers are seeing the value in SEP 11 and SNACC and are rapidly adopting the new products.  During the December quarter we shipped 23 million seats of SEP.  In addition to implementing upgrades to current customers, we also garnered several major new customer wins that included many competitive displacements.  ", "Net Backup 6.5 also got off to a solid start and was part of many of our largest multi-product deals during the quarter.  Data center administrators are increasingly moving from tape to disk based backup.  Net Backup 6.5 features new disk based backup capabilities which are focused on delivering leading integration of backup appliances and delivering native, sand, disk backup, and deep duplication features.  These options allow us to take full advantage of the power of disk based data protection.  Customers also like Net Backup\u2019s ability to backup VMware environments. Net Backup 6.5 won the Best In Show BM World Gold Award in September.  ", "One of our strongest revenue growth products is Backup Exec, the market\u2019s leading Windows-based data and system recovery solution.  The 11 D version of Backup Exec which was released a little over a year ago has been a tremendous success for both Symantec and our channel partners.  We have found that small and medium sized businesses are embracing the product\u2019s robust management capabilities.  We\u2019re looking forward to building on that momentum with the release of Backup Exec 12 in the March quarter.  ", "Worldwide demand is also unprecedented for our Enterprise Vault, the leading email archiving and retrieval product.  Enterprise Vault has been in the leadership category of Gardner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for the past several years and is currently the only product in the leadership category. We believe Enterprise Vault has become the de facto solution for addressing the ever-increasing regulations around e-discovery.  ", "The Altiris business experienced strong new license growth and robust sequential growth as customers are embracing the convergence of security and systems management at the end point.  These results include the SME benefits received from the channel alignment and mapping work that has been done for some time now.  For large enterprise accounts, we are particularly pleased with the traction Altiris is getting with sales force cross training, particularly in international markets as Altiris continues to leverage Symantec\u2019s broad global reach.", "Over the past three quarters we\u2019ve made significant strides in integrating the Altiris technologies.  In some of our key products the Altiris architecture has allowed us for relatively easy integration into products such as Symantec End Point Protection 11 and Backup Exec System Recovery.  This rapid progress has redefined the benchmark for all of our engineering teams with regard to new technology integration.  ", "Currently we\u2019re focused on further\u00a0extending the Altiris web services model to tie all of the technologies together via the Altiris framework.  Additional integration opportunities exist which would enhance the Altiris offerings ability to push patches and link to a vulnerability database.  Finally, we are well positioned as companies migrate to Vista and we are excited about the sales opportunities Altiris solutions can bring to us during this process.  ", "Now on the consumer side of the business, we are maintaining our category leadership by bringing the most innovative products to the market targeted at various consumer segments.  Norton Internet Security works well for the wired segment who are more used to assembling their own PC solutions and are often the folks who own NIS together with Norton System Works or another one of our point products. ", "The introduction of Norton 360 allowed us to focus on the under served segment we call digital families.  Many of these customers already own an internet solution but wanted it to be easier to use and demanded that it provide an all-in-one protection service.  Norton 360 delivered and is ramped to over 25% of our new consumer sales, representing our most successful consumer product launch to date. The explosive adoption rates of Norton 360 validates our consumer strategy and underscores the market demand for a more targeted product portfolio and affirms consumer\u2019s willingness to pay a premium price for the best solution. We expect to launch the 2.0 version of Norton 360 by the end of March. The new product includes browser protection, Norton Identity Safe, which secures your passwords, and Symantec\u2019s Advanced Anti-Phishing technology which extends our whole security capability to offer protection against online fraud.  The new version will also provide more options for backup destinations including Blu Ray, iPods, and shared drives.  It\u2019s clear to me that the most advanced PC security tool on the market is about to take another big step ahead of our competitors.  ", "With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to James to provide the financial details for the quarter.  ", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone.  I am pleased to report that our December quarter results performed better than expected on each of our four primary financial metrics: revenue, deferred revenue, earnings per share, and cash flow from operations.  Now I\u2019ll review the financial details of the December quarter.", "GAAP revenue was $1.52 billion.  Non-GAAP revenue grew 15% versus the December 2006 period to $1.53 billion.  Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP revenue by 5 percentage points year over year and by 2 percentage points sequentially.  The December quarter\u2019s diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.15.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 27% to $0.33 as compared to December 2006.  International non-GAAP revenue for the December quarter grew 21% to $812 million versus the year ago period and represented a record 53% of total non-GAAP revenue.", "The Europe, Middle East, Africa region grew 26% and Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 19%.  Foreign currency movements benefited EMEA revenue by 13 percentage points and APJ revenue by approximately 8 percentage points year-over-year.  The Americas grew 8% year-over-year.  ", "Now I\u2019d like to move to the December quarter\u2019s non-GAAP revenue by segment.  Consumer revenue generated $440 million, up 8% versus the December 2006 quarter.  Norton Internet Security revenue grew 8% and remains the single largest product contributor to our consumer category, generating approximately 59% of consumer revenue.  As Enrique mentioned, Norton 360 now accounts for over 25% of consumer sales activity and is serving to protect and grow a premium market position.  The rich feature set of Norton 360 brings with it a higher average selling price which has allowed us to generate growth despite the continuing decline in the retail channel which now accounts for only 25% of our consumer revenue. ", "Moving now to the enterprise, in the December quarter we generated a record number of large deals. We booked a total of 554 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, an increase of 35% as compared to 409 deals in the December 2006 quarter.  We also recorded 127 deals worth more than $1 million as compared to 115 in the December 2006 quarter.  Almost 80% of large transactions included multiple products or services.  ", "Our Security and Data Management revenue of $448 million grew 9% over the December 2006 quarter.  Backup Exec continued to build momentum, posting revenue growth of over 30% compared to the year ago period and generating solid sequential growth for the fourth consecutive quarter.  Enterprise Vault and our compliance products grew as mid-to high teens rates year-over-year.  The Data Center Management group produced revenue of $444 million and grew 11% from the year ago period.  ", "Storage and server foundation generated record results, growing revenue at mid-teens rates year-over-year and sequentially.  The results were driven by our customers\u2019 desire to simplify their data center infrastructures.  Our customized ROI tool clearly demonstrates how our solutions can improve the operational performance of data centers as well as drive dramatic direct cost savings.  The cost reduction benefits of our simplification and standardization themes continue to resonate with data center customers.  In addition, our foundation solutions provide high availability as well as storage and server optimization across all major virtual machine platforms.", "The Altiris business unit posted non-GAAP revenue of $100 million.  Standalone Altiris solutions generated record non-GAAP revenue of $65 million.  Altiris\u2019 non-GAAP revenue includes the impact of $9 million worth of deferred revenue lost on the GAAP basis as a result of the purchase accounting method related to the acquisition.  Also, our legacy Symantec products, Ghost and PC Anywhere, performed better than expected during the quarter.  Our services group posted strong top line performance, increasing revenue to $96 million.  We are pleased with the services teams ability to generate value by increasing both customer satisfaction and our ability to sell, deliver, and implement more software.  Strong year-over-year growth of 40% was assisted somewhat by one-time administrative challenges that occurred during the December 2006 quarter.  ", "Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 86.2% for the December 2007 quarter as compared to 83.2% for the year ago period, driven by lower costs resulting from our reduction in four sections in addition to the movement of the majority of our consumer OEM fees from the cost of goods sold line to operating expenses.  This is the third consecutive quarter of sequential gross margin improvement, reaffirming that our cost controls are making an impact.  ", "Improved revenue and cost efficiency actions have increased operating margins for the quarter to 27.4%, up 170 basis points year-over-year and up 220 basis points sequentially.  Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $900 million.  Operating expenses declined by about 1% year-over-year after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, exchange rates, and the addition of consumer OEM fees to the operating expense line.  We expect operating expenses excluding acquisitions, exchange rates, and consumer OEM fees in the March quarter to decline by approximately 2% year-over-year.  ", "While we are encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made on costs, we expect consumer OEM fees to increase going forward, driven by PC shipments.  We are on course to drive cost benefits of approximately $350 million versus our original goal of $200 million in FY08.  Our cost improvement initiatives are targeting areas across the business, but we have been diligent to ensure that these reductions don\u2019t impede our ability to bring high quality products to market or hurt our ability to meet customer service levels.  The value of these initiatives is building as the year is progressing, placing us in a stronger expense position as we exit the fiscal year.  We will continue to focus on our cost structure going forward while simultaneously working to identify new opportunities for revenue growth.  ", "GAAP net income was $132 million for the December 2007 quarter.  Non-GAAP net income equaled $292 million, up 16% versus the December 2006 quarter and up 11% sequentially.  Symantec exited December with a cash and short term investments balance of approximately $2 billion.  We have continued to return excess cash flow to our shareholders.  As such, during the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of our outstanding shares or 22.7 million shares, at an average price of $17.60.  Our net accounts receivable balance at the end of the December 2007 quarter was $902 million.  Days sales outstanding or DSOs was 54 days compared to 51 days in December 2006.  DSOs typically peak above 50 in December quarters due to renewal activity concentrated towards calendar year end.", "Cash flow from operating activities for the December 2007 quarter totaled $462 million.  This figure was higher than forecast due to better than expected sales activity.  GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the December 2007 quarter was $2.88 billion.  Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.9 billion, up 12% as compared to the December 2006 quarter and up 10% sequentially.  Foreign currency movements benefited deferred revenue by 5 percentage points year-over-year and by 2 percentage points sequentially.", "Now I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the March quarter.  Two quarters of improved sales execution coupled with four consecutive quarters of improved revenue yield leads us to be more positive on our view of the fourth quarter.  Taking into account the macro economic environment and an exchange rate of $1.45 per euro, our forecast for the March quarter is as follows:  GAAP revenue is estimated to be between $1.5 billion and $1.54 billion.  Non-GAAP revenue is estimated to be between $1.51 billion and $1.55 billion.  We expect to recognize VonTu revenue ratably over the next few quarters until we have established the SOE.  As such, we expect revenue from VonTu sales to be a relatively minor contributor to total revenue during this time.  ", "GAAP earnings per share are forecasted between $0.16 and $0.18.  Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated between $0.33 and $0.35.  This includes $0.02 of dilution related to the acquisition of VonTu as we discussed last quarter.  During the March quarter we expect almost $910 million of our non-GAAP deferred revenue balance to convert into recognized revenue. This is 18% higher than the year ago figure.  Going forward, we expect deferred revenue growth to stabilize and be more aligned with revenue growth rates.  ", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the March quarter is estimated to be between $2.94 billion and $3.04 billion.  We expect non-GAAP deferred revenue to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 billion.  We are raising our guidance for fiscal year 2008 based upon improving operational performance as follows:  GAAP revenue is estimated to be between $5.835 billion and $5.875 billion.  Non-GAAP revenue is estimated to be between $5.9 billion and $5.94 billion.  At midpoint this is $220 million greater than the guidance initially provided.  GAAP earnings per share are forecasted between $0.46 and $0.48.  Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated between $1.24 and $1.26.  At the midpoint, this is $0.13 above our initial guidance.  We expect cash flow from operations for the fiscal year to be greater than the $1.67 billion reported in fiscal year 2007, in line with our original guidance.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to John for some closing remarks.", "John W. Thompson ", "Thank you very much, James.  In conclusion, we\u2019re quite pleased with how we executed during the December quarter.  We remain enthusiastic about the prospects for our recently launched core products such as Symantec End Point Protection 11 and Net Backup 6.5 and we are encouraged by the worldwide demand for our solutions as evidenced by the strong pipeline we are seeing going into our fiscal year end.  We\u2019ve implemented several initiatives to drive top line results.  At the same time, we\u2019ve also focused on the cost side of the equation and will continue to look for ways to make our business even more profitable.  While we will continue to keep a watchful eye on the macroeconomic conditions around the world, we are optimistic that our near-term prospects remain quite strong.  Overall I\u2019m quite confident in our ability to deliver solid growth and improving profitability into the next quarter and fiscal year 2009.  ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Helyn to see if we can take some of your questions.  ", "Helyn Corcos", "Thanks, John.  Wayne, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly.  (Operator Instructions)  We\u2019ll ask that you limit yourself to one initial question with a follow up.  ", "Helyn Corcos ", "While the operator is polling for questions, I\u2019d like to announce that Symantec plans to attend the Thomas Weisel Partners conference on February 6th, the Goldman Sachs conference on February 28th, and the Morgan Stanley conference on March 4th.  In addition, we will be reporting our fiscal fourth quarter results on April 30th.  For a complete list of our investor related events, please visit our events calendar on the Investor Relations Website.  ", "Wayne, we\u2019re ready for our first question.", "Operator", "Very good.  Our first is from Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan.  ", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question.  My first question is on the strength and deferred revenue which was the best number we\u2019ve obviously seen in a number of quarters.  You mentioned the impact of currency on deferred revenue but I also was hoping to find whether or not you saw any material shift in how contracts are getting booked in the quarter towards a bigger component of deferred revenue, if there was anything else behind the strength in that line item.", "James Beer", "Adam, no, really quite to the contrary.  We continue to see an improvement in the revenue yield and in essence that\u2019s correlated with license rather than maintenance so we were very pleased with the fact that we were able to build the deferred revenue balances we did even on an FX adjusted basis under such strong revenue growth circumstances.  ", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "And if I could just shift for one question on the cost side, you mentioned that you did have a couple of cost savings initiatives.  Margins were up on a year to year basis.  Could you detail a little bit some of the areas where you were pulling in expenses and maybe particularly talk about some of the special incentives to the sales organization and the impact those had.  ", "James Beer", "Well our focus on our infrastructure certainly went across the company.  We have gone through a relatively modest reduction in force during the quarter as I think you know.  We also focused on the volume of contractors, consultants who are working here, really looking across all the different line items associated with how we spend money, travel, office expenses, all of those sorts of things, while at the same time really looking to still be able to have the capability to deliver very high quality products and to be able to keep our customer service levels where we want them to be and I think our results reflect that.", "Adam Holt - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question then is from Peter Cooper with Morgan Stanley.", "Peter Cooper - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much.  I\u2019m not sure if this is john or Enrique, but guys last summer we heard a lot about deal losses, some pretty large names, and McAfee was certainly making good noise that they were picking up a lot of competitive wins.  John, I think specifically you said this quarter you had some competitive placements.  Are you seeing that environment now shift back in your favor from a stability point of view and is that because of 11.0 coming out or being more aggressive on price or a little more color there would be very helpful, please. ", "John W. Thompson", "Well Peter I think it\u2019s quite clear in our results that SEP 11 has certainly arrested any declines that we might have seen in the end point security component of our business.  As Enrique noted in his planned remarks, we shipped 23 million units in the quarter.  That said, there was a fair amount of pent up demand from the channel and from our customers for what they thought to be a pretty doggone good product.  You couple that with some of the marquee name win backs that we did, some of which I personally was involved in, and it gives us great reason to be encouraged that our engineering team and our product management team did just an absolutely superb job in building this product.  While we would have loved to have had it a year ago, I\u2019m damn glad we got it now.", "Peter Cooper - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And then in line with that thinking now, I think you\u2019re offering a more comprehensive suite at the end point, and in your comments, John, I think you said you\u2019d be reflectively inquisitive.  If I heard that right, given you guys have run the gamut from smaller deals like a Seagate to a medium size deal to VonTu and up to an Altiris size, are there any deal size considerations at this point or are you just going to be selective where it makes sense as a general rule?", "John W. Thompson", "As a general rule, Peter, we\u2019re focused on securing and managing the world\u2019s information.  So you should expect to see us do transactions in those categories of activity.  Now we also recognize that in order to secure and manage the world\u2019s information, you\u2019ve got to do more to help them automate their infrastructure, so there\u2019s likely to be some server management related activities that we\u2019ll engage in as well, but we don\u2019t have a size dimension that is a delimiter for us although we have no big deals planned, that\u2019s for sure.", "Peter Cooper - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much, John. Congrats.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Heather Bellini with UBS.  ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Hi John, good afternoon.  I had a question.  Last quarter you were pretty insightful.  You commented about the swelling of the US economy and gave what ended up being maybe guidance that was a little bit too cautious.  I saw your comments on January 9th that you put out on Reuters and I\u2019m just wondering what do you think is different that gives you the confidence given your comments about now you see it spreading to maybe economies outside the US to raise numbers whereas you didn\u2019t have it last quarter.  I guess that\u2019s one question and then I have a follow up about the end point compliance product.", "John W. Thompson", "I think what we saw Heather throughout the quarter was continued build and the momentum for many of our core products.  WE saw across the board very, very solid growth in end point protection.  In our Data Center Management products they had double digit growth for the first time in a very, very long time and when we look at the pipeline of deals planned for the March quarter and the coverage ratios that we would expect to see coming into the quarter, we have the highest coverage ratios we\u2019ve had in several years.  You couple that with higher quality products, improving employee morale and customer satisfaction, candidly, those are the things that underpin our confidence in the March quarter.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Okay, and then a follow up on the end point compliance product.  You shipped 23 million units.  Can you talk about the percentage of those 23 million units where people are actually turning it on for the first time so there\u2019s a revenue opportunity for you versus a maintenance opportunity?", "John W. Thompson", "Candidly, Heather, I don\u2019t have that granular a view at this point.  I would suspect however that the vast majority of them are going into the existing base of customers short of the competitive win backs that we saw during the quarter. ", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.  ", "Analyst for Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, this is Derek in for Sarah.  Congratulations on the quarter.  I wanted to maybe get some detail on the realignment of back into what seems like storage and security divisions and interested in what drove that decision.", "John W. Thompson", "Well actually it\u2019s not storage and security divisions. We may have not characterized it as well to you in our press release but the Data Center Management group as it was called is being repackaged to reflect our storage and server focus.  What we didn\u2019t want to do was to suggest that by having organizations focused on particular buyers we could lock technology into one unit or another.  So what I want to happen as a result of this realignment is that our team will do a great deal more to share both the technology that we have in our portfolio and the skills that we have in our engineering and architectural teams and by moving away from a \u201cWell I manage the data center and I manage consumer and I manage this that or the other\u201d hopefully we\u2019ll get better cross-company sharing of the capabilities that clearly can differentiate Symantec in the marketplace.", "Analyst for Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Is there going to be any change from that in terms of how the channel is covered or served?", "John W. Thompson", "No, not at all.", "", "Analyst for Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay and then just one follow up on the APM divestiture.  Is that likely to be the largest that we\u2019re likely to see in terms of assets that you\u2019re looking to shed?", "John W. Thompson", "As we continue to work our analysis of our portfolio and we have something to tell you about from a divestiture point of view, we\u2019ll do that.", "", "Analyst for Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you very much.", "", "Operator", "Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. ", "", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi guys.  John, you mentioned the continued strength of that Backup Exec product line you say a year after the launch now.  I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d just comment on just your outlook there but also on that Net Backup business and how do you just view the growth rate of the overall backup market and sort of particularly between those two segments?", "", "John W. Thompson", "Well we have seen, Phil, just phenomenal growth in Backup Exec for now four or five consecutive quarters.  As a matter of fact, it had its strongest quarter last quarter in the history of the product and the 12.0 version that\u2019s expected to launch in March that Enrique referenced has some really, really incredible features and it more tightly integrates the backup and archiving function.  It candidly does some of the things that we had envisioned when we brought the two companies together where you can have a vulnerability alert trigger a more frequent backup process so it\u2019s our belief that we\u2019re starting to see some of the real benefits that we had envisioned a few years ago in bringing security and security-related activity closer to where information is being either managed or stored.  Now that said, our hope is that we can sustain this momentum for Backup Exec and we can accelerate what\u2019s going on in the net backup market.  Clearly, Backup Exec is gaining share.  The view as to the global backup market is a mid single digit market and we are growing in high teens, candidly in some markets, low 20s.  We have strong results in the most recent quarter for Net Backup that is more in line with market growth rates and so I think what this says is you deliver quality products, you put great support around it, and you can grow at or above the market rate, and that\u2019s clearly the case for our backup business now.", "", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks guys.", "Operator ", "Our next question is from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hey guys, nice quarter.  Just turning to the consumer market for a moment, I know you guys gave some commentary in terms of Norton 360 and the record uptake you\u2019ve seen, but could you just step back and give us a sense for where you think the growth profile of this industry is today if you look out two or three years, where you see kind of the optimum penetration, international versus domestic, and what\u2019s the upsell opportunity to suite?  How far down that path are we and kind of what\u2019s the uptake expectations going forward?", "John W. Thompson", "Well Todd as you look at the consumer business, one of the things that\u2019s important to note is the market is absolutely saying they want to see continued move to all-in-one security solutions and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the success with Norton 360.  25% of the bookings of the quarter were associated with that offering so we think that there\u2019s a lot of runway to continue to move that broader offering not only to the digital families but across the entire segment, and that\u2019s not only here in the US, that\u2019s around the world.  So there\u2019s a continued strong opportunity to move form the point products or even Norton Internet Security to the higher value Norton 360 product.  At this point we see the same drivers around the world that we\u2019ve always seen which are around PC shipments and broadband adoption so we always monitor those carefully and ultimately some of our growth rates are associated with those two fundamental drivers but we are very encouraged by the success of Norton 360 and we think that really signals what the marketplace is saying which is people don\u2019t want to have lots and lots of point products.  They want to have one integrated solution that solves the issues around protecting their PC and protecting when they go online.", "Enrique Salem", "One follow up think I would add to that Todd is that as you look at the shift to a different form factor device where it\u2019s not a laptop or a PC but it may be an iPod or a Treo, that\u2019s going to require a different combination of technologies and quite frankly we believe perhaps a different business model and so one of the things we were trying to do with our recent realignment was to think through how could we within the company incubate businesses that would focus on different technology packaging and different business models so they\u2019re not, if you will, sacrificed by the high revenue, high margin components of our business as we have to make tradeoffs from an investment perspective.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Just two quick follow ups on that.  How much of the business would you attribute to international today versus domestic and do you guys feel you\u2019re growing faster than the market in line or below?", "James Beer ", "Well the international revenue base is now representing 53% of total business and I mentioned in my remarks that we were pleased with our growth rate so 26% in Europe, 19% in Asia --", "", "", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m talking business to consumer.", "", "James Beer ", "Ah, okay.  In terms of the consumer business, it\u2019s about the same balance in terms of revenue offshore versus within the United States and so we\u2019re quite pleased with that balance of business.  We feel as though our emphasis on Norton 360, the product suite, is playing well in different parts of the world, just as well as it is playing in the US.  ", "John W. Thompson", "A great example, Todd, of where we\u2019re doing really well, for example in the international markets you take the UK market and what we\u2019re seeing from a market share perspective.  I mean, those numbers aren\u2019t very impressive and so around the world we\u2019re having success, not only with the core products but also with the new products like Norton 360.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. Thanks, guys.  ", "", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James.  ", "", "Analyst for Michael Turits - Raymond James", "Hi, this is Miranda Davidson calling for Michael Turits.  Can you give us any more details on the turnaround of the sales organization in North America?", "John W. Thompson", "I think what I would tell you is it starts with some of the changes we made in the leadership team and we put in a new leader in the Americas who has refocused our efforts there and really started to turn the overall morale of the organization around and then we also have strong leaders in Asia Pacific and in Europe.  Quite frankly the other thing that we did was we moved our specialist organization to focus on new license and I think that was an important shift that has helped the overall execution of our team, but I think that the leadership that we put in place and some of the changes that we\u2019ve made around comp and coverage models has definitely helped overall.", "Analyst for Michael Turits - Raymond James", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tim Klasell with Thomas Weisel Partners.  ", "Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "A quick question with the Backup Exec 12 launch.  Clearly you\u2019ve had a great run with 11.  Do you expect  any freeze ups or can you sort of walk us through what you\u2019d expect from the growth of that product as you get closer to the launch?", "John W. Thompson", "Well actually if we look at the Backup Exec market, while 11 D has gone exceedingly well, there are still many, many, many thousands of customers that are on older versions than even 11 D so the focus of the 12 launch is to make sure that we can pull many of those customers into the new technology realm that 12.0 product will represent.  So we don\u2019t expect or anticipate any slow down in that business as a result of this launch given how broad the opportunity base is to upsell man of our customers. ", "Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then one real quick one, I know one of the objectives with 360 was to have people backing up online it would be a stickier sale, can you give us any idea of what percentage of the Norton 360 customers are actually using the backup feature?", "John W. Thompson", "Right now of the products that we\u2019ve shipped, about a third of all of the users of 360 are using the online service.  We have already surpassed a new high water mark both in terms of the penetration of the product where I think Enrique said it represents 25% of new sales into the market, and we have an enormous number of new backup customers who are on the service.", "Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Ives with FBR.", "Daniel Ives - FBR Group", "Yeah, thanks. Question with the current environment with [cards] uncertain.  Do you believe that Symantec can capitalize on that just given the reputation, the breadth of your products, and maybe some customers that would normally go to smaller vendors now would go to Symantec? Do you think that\u2019s an opportunity for as we look out on the next few quarters?  ", "John W. Thompson", "We think we are participating in the markets that are certainly going to get the lion\u2019s share of the net new spending that will occur, hence security and storage management.  We think we have a very, very strong global brand and great presence in all of the markets around the world.  We\u2019re focused on this very simple idea that today\u2019s security environment is policy centered, it is all about having a set of operationalized infrastructures such that you really can manage the information more closely.  That means the infrastructure has to be focused on complexity reduction and a whole range of things that are key to our portfolio, so we think we\u2019re in pretty good shape.  If the markets decline a bit we think the spending will come our way.  If the markets are robust, we\u2019ll get more than our fair share.  ", "Daniel Ives - FBR Group", "Okay, great.  Thanks, great quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Katherine Egbert at Jeffries and Company.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co.", "Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple questions.  Enrique, first, your sales quotes for the specialists, are they all new licenses or is it a simple majority of new licenses of the quote itself?  ", "Enrique Salem ", "For specialists it is new licenses.  ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co.", "Solely new licenses.", "Enrique Salem ", "Yes. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, great and then you mentioned the word divestiture and I apologize if someone else asked this earlier, to what extent are you divested?  I mean, will you do kind of what VeriSign is doing, communicating in advance if there\u2019s bundles per sale, will you put anything into discontinued ops?  Can you give us some sense?", "Enrique Salem ", "That\u2019s not our plan.  We announced last week our intent to divest of the application performance management business. That business, quite frankly, we think will be better served, more importantly, our customers will be better served, by the investments that new owners are going to place around that, and we think the team will have a chance to show that they can continue to deliver innovative technologies with a higher investment stream behind them, but we have no intent to follow anyone else\u2019s model. We\u2019ll follow our own model which is as we make decisions about our portfolio we\u2019ll announce those to you.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, fair enough, thanks.", "", "Operator", "We do have time for a few additional questions.  (Operator Instructions)  We do have a question from Brian Freed with Morgan Keegan.", "Brian Freed - Morgan Keegan", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my call.  Could you talk a little bit about your emerging product segments, things like [inaudible] duplication and the DLP products with VonTu and what you see is kind of the market tone and timing for those types of solutions?", "John W. Thompson", "When you think about what\u2019s happening in the data center, there\u2019s a clear move from tape to disk based backup and so we\u2019re obviously benefiting from that because without Net Backup 6.5 product and what we call our pure disk offering, it is completely integrated into that backup platform, so what we\u2019re able to do is go back into the customer base and upsell them to the disk based backup capabilities and that is momentum in the marketplace.  Every major customer that I speak to is absolutely thinking about how do they move away from tape.  That presents a strong opportunity and when I think about what our goals were in the accomplishment, pure disk is definitely on track or a little bit ahead of what I had expected.", "Enrique Salem", "I think on the DLP side what I would tell you is, on the data leak prevention side, where we are is that that is a very top of mind issue for the entire organization, not just the IT department, but the executives inside of the company where they worry about the liabilities around moving customer data or employee data and the notoriety that goes with that, so definitely a lot of momentum.  We\u2019ve seen success in a couple of verticals.  We actually think that that opportunity spans across all companies that have to protect information and that basically is everyone, so we see a tremendous opportunity for Symantec and as John says, us securing and managing the world\u2019s information.", "Brian Freed - Morgan Keegan", "Great, thanks.", "Helyn Corcos", "I believe that\u2019s all we have for time.  ", "Operator", "That is correct, and we\u2019ll turn the call to John Thompson for a closing comment.", "John W. Thompson", "Well thank you everyone for dialing in this afternoon.  I\u2019m awfully, awfully proud of our team and the results that they delivered in the December quarter.  More importantly, I\u2019m encouraged by their enthusiasm for our outlook for the March quarter.  It\u2019s been a really, really interesting fiscal year for us.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are John Thompson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec; Enrique Salem, Chief Operating Officer; and James Beer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a moment I will turn the call over to John. He will provide high level comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and year end results which ended March 28, 2008, as well as provide an overview of objectives for fiscal year 2009. Enrique will follow with highlights and James will wrap it up with a review of the financial details and a discussion of our guidance as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question and answer session.", "Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec\u2019s Investor Relations homepage at www.symantec.com/invest. A copy of today\u2019s press release and supplemental financial information are available on our website and a copy of today\u2019s prepared remarks will be available on the Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed. ", "During the March, 2008 quarter we modified the definition of our segments in order to best focus our efforts and maximize the cross-utilization of our resources and expertise. We consolidated two of our business segments, the Security and Data Management Group and the Altiris Group into one segment called the Security and Compliance Group. We also moved our Backup Exec product from the Security and Data Management Group to join our Net Backup Products in the Server and Storage Management segment. Our Consumer and Services segments remain unchanged. We provided historical compares for these new segments in our press release and supplemental information which has been posted on our website. ", "Before we begin I\u2019d like to remind everyone that some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contains forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company\u2019s most recent periodic reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results which can be found in the press release and on our website. ", "And now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. John Thompson.", "John Thompson", "Thanks Helyn and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to announce another record revenue and earnings quarter for Symantec; our fifth in a row. More importantly we were quite pleased with the momentum we\u2019ve built over the past several quarters and I\u2019m particularly proud of our team and their efforts and accomplishments. This performance is a great close to fiscal \u201908 and a good start to fiscal \u201909.", "In addition to strong revenue and earnings results, our deferred revenue and strong cash flow generation during the March quarter underscore the strength of our business. This strength was driven by our broad portfolio of offerings and continued focus on solid execution. In addition to continued solid performance in our consumer segment, there were a number of key product areas that delivered strong double-digit growth including email archiving, storage management, backup, and systems management. ", "Throughout fiscal year \u201908 we made significant progress in cross-selling and up-selling an expanded portfolio of Symantec\u2019s products and services to both new and existing customers. In addition adjustments to sales and marketing programs as well as improved execution fueled more than 1,500 large deals during the year. We fortified our strength at the endpoint with the addition of Altiris and Vontu. We believe the combination of Symantec and Altiris will enable our customers to better manage and enforce security policies at the endpoint, identify and protect against threats as well as remediate and manage IT assets.", "Vontu has enabled us to immediately achieve a leadership position in the rapidly growing market for data loss prevention solutions. These transactions represent a natural extension of our security strategy and reflect the way our customers have told us they want to manage their infrastructure. We launched innovative new products in areas of the market where we already have strong leadership positions. For example in Backup we added Disk Space Backup to our market-leading backup products and introduced new Enterprise Storage Management to our foundation platform for more efficient use of storage resources. ", "Another example of our product innovation was the creation of a powerful single agent for addressing multiple security threats at the enterprise endpoint and the introduction of Online Backup for consumers and enterprises alike. We exit the fiscal year with the strongest product portfolio we\u2019ve had in years.", "I\u2019m pleased to say that we were able to accomplish these developments while managing our expenses and delivering on our long-term objective of improving operating margins by 100 basis points per year. We believe we\u2019ve entered the new fiscal year with momentum and we are well positioned for continued success. The pipeline is strong and visibility continues to improve. During this fiscal year we intend to leverage our core strengths in Endpoint Protection and Backup to slingshot new growth opportunities, up-sell new functionalities and drive incremental business.", "There are several areas of focus for this fiscal year that should further strengthen our operating returns. First we have a rich portfolio of products and services with a number of key product introductions scheduled during the year which Enrique will highlight in a moment. Second we have successfully added a number of new technologies and businesses into Symantec that can be leveraged across our portfolio. Third we are refocusing our investments toward higher growth areas while we continue to improve the overall operating returns and finally our cash position is quite strong as we enter the new year.", "So let me give you an example of how we intend to capitalize on a few emerging industry-growth trends. These include data loss prevention, endpoint virtualization, software as a service and consumer services. First on data loss prevention or DLP, Vontu expanded our presence in the rapidly growing data loss prevention market with clear leadership functionality at all tiers; network, storage and endpoint, managed from a central console. In order to compliment our data loss prevention capabilities Symantec is partnering with Guardian Edge to deliver proven endpoint encryption products to complement our endpoint protection platform.", "Both DLP and endpoint encryption are key components in helping customers protect valuable information that resides on laptops and desktops. During the March quarter we launched Symantec Endpoint Encryption 6.0, a software tool that provides advanced encryption for desktops and laptops and removable storage devices. It offers scalable enterprise-wide security that prevents unauthorized access by using strong access control and powerful encryption. Its audit reporting capability helps address regulatory requirements for validating compliance, enforcing security policies and mitigating risk of data loss. ", "In addition Endpoint Encryption can be managed by our Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 console. Going forward we see excellent opportunities to broaden the distribution of our DLP and encryption products particularly in international markets and to integrate with several of our key products including mail security and archiving. The content awareness capabilities of Vontu\u2019s technology will allow our customers to make smarter decisions about archiving and encrypting highly sensitive information. Through this integration our customers will be able to archive only key data and save on the rapidly growing storage costs further differentiating Symantec from competition. ", "Second on endpoint virtualization, new technologies like virtualization are evolving to enable more efficient management and flexible use of endpoints. Symantec\u2019s application virtualization technology is changing the way software is delivered and managed at the endpoint. Bringing virtualization to the endpoint offers IT a natural migration path toward a more fluid computing environment, one that affectively balances the often conflicting trade-offs between security and flexibility.", "Our recent acquisition of [Apstream] which is already incorporated in our software virtualization services products complement our endpoint management and virtualization portfolio. The combination of streaming technologies with our endpoint virtualization solution provides customers the flexibility to offer on-demand services of data and applications, free of application conflicts and upgrade concerns thus saving on administrative and licensing costs. Over time as endpoints evolve to incorporate a range of computing delivery models, local or streamed applications with physical and virtual desktops, Symantec will provide solutions that support and manage this complexity. ", "The Apstream acquisition is also very attractive to Symantec in that it gives us the opportunity to integrate streaming technologies throughout our product offerings from endpoint security through the network tier. ", "Third on software as a service, in mid February we launched two services from the Symantec protection network, our new software as a service business designed to provide our small and medium size customers with a suite of online availability and security solutions. At that time we announced the first of many offerings we plan to deliver through the Symantec protection network. Symantec Online Backup providing online backup for servers and desktops and laptops and Symantec Online Storage for Backup Exec, a disaster recovery service for mid size customers.", "Like future Symantec protection network services each of these solutions was designed to provide best-in-class protection of our customers\u2019 mission critical business data. We are very pleased with the early reception of these offerings and have also been quite happy with the positive response from the press and analyst community. As we move forward we expect to deliver additional SaaS offerings in areas where we have market-leading products such as Endpoint Security, Archiving and Messaging and we will continue to work closely with our partners to bring these capabilities to market. ", "Lastly on our consumer business which is three times the scale of our nearest competitor, we will continue to expand our category leadership by bringing innovative products to the market. We have executed the winning strategy by driving incremental revenue per customer and monetizing our install base of customers as they migrate from point products to suites, to value-added services. We are complementing our consumer software business by delivering a range of premium services such as expert installation, systems\u2019 checks, and PC performance tune-ups. The customer feedback has been quite strong and services should under [inaudible] our growth objectives for this segment this year.", "In closing let me underscore the confidence I have in our business and our future. Symantec is a great company of superb brands and a very talented team. More than ever our customers and partners are looking to Symantec to help them secure and manage their information across the full spectrum of operating platforms. In the face of rapidly changing technologies we feel good about how our business is positioned as we enter the new fiscal year. We look forward to delivering on those expectations and have no doubt that we will succeed. ", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Enrique Salem who will provide more details on the March quarter.", "Enrique Salem", "Thanks John and good afternoon everyone. I am very pleased with the strong performance or our team during the March quarter. Sales execution continued to show improvement around the world with all regions posting double-digit revenue growth. In addition there were a number of key product areas that generated strong growth. These include email archiving, backup, storage management, systems management, and consumer. ", "Each of these products have one thing in common; they are industry leading and allow our customers to secure and manage their information. We continue to execute better than expected in the archiving market and are winning against our competitors. Our market-leading product Enterprise Vault had another very strong quarter with our revenue growing faster than the market growth rate. The ever increasing demands on long-term storage of email combined with increasing regulations around compliance and e-discovery continue to drive the demand for this product. ", "We have been the only vendor positioned in the leadership category of Gardner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for four years in a row. Enterprise Fault is recognized as the leading archiving product by Gardner, IDC and Forrester. Our market-leading data protection franchise which consists of Backup Exec and Net Backup posted solid results and grew by double-digits year-over-year on a revenue basis. We intend to leverage these technologies such as continuous data protection, de-duplication, and virtual platform support across both product sets and also align our ongoing go-to-market activities to further capture market share and extend our leadership position.", "In the March quarter we released Backup Exec 12.0, the first fully certified backup product for the newly released Windows 2008 Server. The release is a great example of how we\u2019re leveraging and integrating technologies across our product portfolio. For example, this new version of the Windows backup product is integrated with our threat con sensor enabling the product to automatically trigger frequent backups when threat levels are elevated. This new functionality is particularly important for [SMB] customers with limited staff. ", "In addition Backup Exec now provides data protection for Enterprise Fault and includes a simple, easy to manage offsite storage option via the Symantec protection network; our software as a service platform. ", "Net Backup 6.5 continues to resonate well with our customers. Sales were driven by increased adoption of disk-based backup protection and our peer disk de-duplication product. Our relationship with many of the largest companies in the world is built on the success of our storage foundation product. Storage foundation posted strong revenue and grew in the mid-teens year-over-year. Results were driven by our customers\u2019 desire to standardize the storage management software across their heterogeneous environments and simplify their data center infrastructure. ", "Our increased focus on operational efficiency will continue to drive improvements in operating results in this business. Our systems management business generated strong sales activity. We are quite pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made integration Altiris technologies into some of our key products. The Altiris web services based architecture has allowed for relatively easy integration of our core security and Windows-based backup offerings. We believe a well managed endpoint is a secure endpoint.", "During the March quarter we released the Altiris Workflow Solution which includes [prosodimation] technology acquired earlier in the year. The capability in this new product enhances our ability to tie our endpoint security products with our management solutions.

The consumer business generated record revenue of $449 million, up 10% versus the March, 2007 quarter. Electronic distribution represented nearly 75% of consumer revenue and grew 12% as compared to March, 2007 driven primarily by strong activity from our subscription renewals, ISPs and OEMs. In the enterprise arena the breadth and quality of our security, availability and services solutions continues to drive the number of our large transactions.

Storage foundation performed particularly well during the quarter. We also recently implemented a targeted reduction in force in the storage and server group, as we work to bring our expenses in line with peer and internal benchmarks. ", "Our security and compliance group which now includes Altiris generated revenue of $439 million. We are pleased with the performance of Altiris during the March quarter that they generated record sales activity and revenue in line with our expectations. ", "Our enterprise security products also generated record revenue during the quarter and we continue to see strong growth from our archiving solutions. Our services group generated revenue of $97 million, up 12% year-over-year representing 6% of our total revenue. We continue to refocus our services business on addressing the needs of our software customers. For example Symantec residency services enable customers to augment the capabilities of their own IT staff with our highly qualified on-sight consultants who possess the skills to manage complex IT solutions. We are seeing particularly strong demand for this type of service. At the same we are focused on improving the cost efficiency of our services operations and we are pleased with the contribution improvements that the group has made during the past couple of quarters.", "Non-GAAP gross margin increased 200 basis points to 86% for the March, 2008 quarter as compared to the year-ago period.

So SEP is doing quite well in its first two quarters in the market. The NAC component is getting very, very strong lift in the marketplace and its helping us to drive higher unit value if you will per endpoint sold. So we\u2019re quite pleased with the early receptivity of NAC and would expect that to continue certainly as the product continues to mature in the market.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "And just on that 21 million clients this quarter and then what you had in December, penetration wise is that a quarter in, a third in?", "John Thompson", "Well we don\u2019t typically give numbers on the install base but let\u2019s put it this way, we think we have close to 100 million users out there on the enterprise side so with 40 plus million to date that might give you a sense of where we are.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Just on the op margin side, James terrific job year-over-year, what\u2019s kind of the goal as you look forward over longer term in terms of how much more upside could we get to operating margins?", "James Beer", "Well one of our financial objectives is to improve operating margins by around 100 basis points each year and obviously we\u2019re pleased that we have been able to deliver that in fiscal \u201908 and that\u2019s the plan going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS", "Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS", "Just a follow-up to Sarah\u2019s question you were just referring John to an uptick in the average unit value that you see as people are adopting the NAC offerings, could you give us an idea of what that uptick in average unit value is?", "John Thompson", "Well competitively I\u2019d really rather not start to talk about what kind of price yields we were seeing in the marketplace, I just don\u2019t think in light of the economic environment that\u2019s in our best interest. But I do think its fair to say that the combination of SEPT and maintenance price increase that we\u2019ve built in and NAC are helping us drive higher price yield per endpoint. That\u2019s ultimately the objective.", "Enrique Salem", "It also varies by the size of deal that we do.", "Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS", "I was listening to James\u2019 comment, you\u2019ve now had two very strong quarters in a row, not just revenue and EPS but also deferred, there\u2019s really nothing to complain about when you look at these numbers, and I guess this is the level of consistency that I know the market\u2019s been waiting for, I was wondering if you could share with us what you think has changed that has enabled this to happen? What do you think, where do you think you are in the process of taking this to the next level and having this consistency going forward?", "John Thompson", "Let me beg to differ with you just a little bit, this is the fifth consecutive quarter beating all four of our primary metric. So while March was strong, and December was strong, we have had five consistent\u2026", "Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS", "I was referring to September when you lowered guidance to December, so in terms of everything connecting together.", "John Thompson", "But let\u2019s get to the second question which is where do we think we are. We think we are in terrific shape. We have a very strong pipeline coming in to this quarter. The sales leadership team around the world is really, really operating quite well. We just finished our worldwide sales kick off for this fiscal year. It was probably the most exciting kick off I\u2019ve ever attended in the 37 years I\u2019ve been in this business and so I\u2019m pleased with where our company is. The back office is working well. The front office is doing well and the guys are building some pretty innovative products day in and day out so all in all I think we\u2019re on a roll.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Thill \u2013 Citigroup", "Brett Thill \u2013 Citigroup", "John just in your comments on the strong pipeline can you just contrast the demand environment when you look at the US versus EMEA and APAC?", "John Thompson", "We don\u2019t see any real distinction between the regions of the world given candidly the product portfolio that we have, our products tend to be the hygiene components of every IT infrastructure. You must secure and manage the digital content that you\u2019re creating regardless to whether you\u2019re a small business or a large business or a consumer. And so around the world there\u2019s fairly even pull on the reins from a demand perspective. We would expect Asia to continue to do well given that those are economies that are growing faster than anywhere else in the world. Japan and Germany continue to be challenging environments but nonetheless overall EMEA and APJ are doing well. And candidly the leadership change that we made in the America\u2019s what Bill has done with his team has really got the America\u2019s on track and we\u2019re quite pleased with their performance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in the SMB channel, a number of companies have commented that they were beginning to see some signs of weakness there.", "Enrique Salem", "We aren\u2019t seeing any real changes in the SMB space. There continues to be strong demand for our security products and our backup offerings. Backup Exec continues to do very, very well for us particularly focused on that segment. So we haven\u2019t seen anything that causes us concern.", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "And James we\u2019ve got an extra week here in Q1 does that mean we have one less week in your Q2 and that we should model that accordingly so that we don\u2019t get this wrong when we model it out?", "James Beer", "That\u2019s right, in Q2, Q3 and Q4 we go back to the traditional 13 week quarter.

But make no mistake about it, we will continue to compete with a number of folks in that channel but it does continue to be an important customer acquisition channel for us and so we will always make sure that we\u2019re doing deals that allow us to continue to bring in a nice steady stream of new customers into the consumer business.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "You have talked about divesting some of the slower growth businesses, any kind of update as you look at the portfolio of products today and thoughts in terms of potential divestitures going forward?", "John Thompson", "Contrary to popular rumor we have no plans in place to divest of anything; none.

So ultimately the priority for Symantec is to drive new business and ultimately new license sales; that\u2019s the number one thing that we\u2019re focused on in fiscal year \u201909.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Aaron Schwartz - JP Morgan", "Aaron Schwartz - JP Morgan", "Just a follow-up on the last question, it looks like the license as a percentage of revenue has picked up by about a point in the second half of the year and I\u2019m just wondering if that is a factor of the shift to new license or if there\u2019s just been stabilization in the amount you\u2019re deferring, I\u2019m just trying to contrast the change in the sales organization with maybe what\u2019s being deferred and recognized on the license side.", "Enrique Salem", "What I would comment on is we definitely have had a focus on driving new license and that would lead to what you\u2019re saying. As far as it being one percent, that\u2019s not a number that I\u2019m looking at right now but ultimately our focus is on driving new license.", "James Beer", "And remember that a lot of our new sales are accounted for in the subscriptions line, so consumer new sales, a lot of our enterprise security new sales so when you look at the line labeled license on our press release it doesn\u2019t give you the full picture for the new sales that are going on in the organization.", "Aaron Schwartz - JP Morgan", "I know there\u2019s been a lot of changes on your channel side; I think the latest news has been, I\u2019m just wondering if you could update us with changes in your strategy there?", "Enrique Salem", "Ultimately when we look at our go-to-market trends, you\u2019re always going to keep refining who are our priority partners and we will concentrate our business on a number of key partners and what you heard there is that we\u2019re narrowing who are the folks that we go to market with. Expect to continue to see us refine where we invest both from a resource and focus perspective and that\u2019s what you heard on that announcement. In particular though expect us to continue to leverage our broad based two tier distribution model where it makes sense and there are places where absolutely we will continue to leverage it and there are places where we will refocus some of our efforts. So ultimately though we have a very broad distribution channel that we\u2019ll continue to leverage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "You mentioned an OEM relationship with Guardian Edge to get into the endpoint encryption market through a partnership, I\u2019m wondering if you could comment on integration there, obviously McAfee has been pitching with [inaudible] to see the time with [Epolicy Orchestrator] just curious what you plan to do from that standpoint and then also, you\u2019ve been mentioning license, revenue, license, revenue, this quarter was also particularly stronger, probably one of the best quarters you\u2019ve had year-over-year in a few years, what is driving that on the storage side if anything in particular, what product lines?", "Enrique Salem", "On the first question expect the new encryption technology will be integrated with our Symantec Endpoint Protection technology. So you\u2019ll manage all aspects of security from the Symantec Endpoint Protection console. But more importantly to us is not only what we\u2019re doing on the security side but it\u2019s also the integration with our new systems management technology from Altiris. Because that\u2019s where we really drive the higher value as we continue to say its all about not only security but managing that endpoint because that\u2019s the only way you truly have security and so expect that we\u2019ll continue to bring all these technologies much closer together as we\u2019ve already started to with the release of Symantec Endpoint Protection 11. ", "The second part of the question on new license, what we think about is we had very good performance across the businesses, both in our storage business and our security business and so we\u2019re seeing very good performance across a broad range of our portfolio and that is really all about what we focus on is what we\u2019re going to deliver and we\u2019ve been focused on new license and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing it in our results. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert - Jefferies and Company", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies and Company", "We\u2019ve seen a lot of weakness in some of the smaller point centers in the enterprise security area, do you feel like you\u2019re taking share or are you at any rate taking advantage of weakness in those areas and then conversely are you seeing your major competitors doing anything unusual to try to take share?", "John Thompson", "I think what\u2019s playing out is what we believed for the last five or six years that large enterprises want to do business with fewer providers and they want to do business with providers that have a broader portfolio of offerings that helps them reduce the cost and complexity of deploying those technologies and so I think in more challenging economic times, you\u2019re going to see pressure perhaps first to the less scaled enterprises that don\u2019t have the richness of portfolio or the richness of relationships. That could in fact lead to price pressures but we haven\u2019t seen that so far.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies and Company", "James, did you say what the impact of currency was on revenue and expenses?", "James Beer", "Yes, in terms of the overall impact on revenue, we were up 13% year-over-year and six points of that was driven by foreign exchange and we don\u2019t breakout the expenses but its going to be a similar type figure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Robert Breza - UBS Capital Markets", "James I was wondering as we look to our models and think about adjusting for the one extra week here in Q1, would you expect a similar split, the 48% 49% in the first half, 51% 52% in the second half, or is there anything else seasonally that we need to think about as we model through the yea?", "James Beer", "Well aside from this incremental 14th week I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing anything different seasonally than we were looking at this time last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates", "Question first on the storage, what are the dynamics you\u2019re seeing in the core backup business with Net Backup and some of the associated products like replication and data [inaudible]. You\u2019ve bought some good products, you\u2019ve made some big improvements with Net Backup 6.5, do you see any change in the competitive environment to share trends?", "Enrique Salem", "Ultimately when you look at what we\u2019ve done with our data protection group which is the combination of both Net Backup and Backup Exec, we are gaining share. I mean that combination is serving us very well and the thing that\u2019s most encouraging is as customers are migrating from tape-based backup to disk-based backup we are seeing a significant opportunity around our new de-dupe capabilities and our peer disk offering. So we are encouraged because now with our 6.5 platform, our Net Backup 6.5 platform, we can continue to add these new modules which I think will obviously benefit the overall performance of our data protection group.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates", "On the security and compliance group it sounds like Altiris did well, if you were to strip out the compliance and look at the enterprise security, what are the growth rate trends there, are they picking up, any way of characterizing what those growth rates are?", "Enrique Salem", "I haven\u2019t broken it out that way.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates", "Anything you can do to give me some color on how that\u2019s doing, even directionally?", "Enrique Salem", "Our security business is doing great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Looking at the security group along the lines of Michael\u2019s question, as you talked about some of your double-digit growers in the quarter, you didn\u2019t talk about the Endpoint and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re stripping out the NAC and Altiris capabilities separately or if the Endpoint in aggregate is growing at less than 10%.", "James Beer", "Yes, the Endpoint is growing at less than 10% but we\u2019re very comfortable that that is the overall performance. As we said a couple of quarters back before we rolled out the new SEP product the first job was going to be focused on upgrading the very large installed base and we\u2019re well down that track as John was alluding to in one of the earlier questions. So that\u2019s been the primary focus. We are pleased that we\u2019ve been able to see some lift year-over-year even while we\u2019ve been doing all of this on the revenue side.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "On the 14-week quarter, I think last time you faced this, it actually provided a couple pennies dilution in the quarter, so is this more a function of the ratability of the model this time around six years later or is this some expectations for the first week of July in terms of just general sales and demand?", "James Beer", "Well it\u2019s hard for me to go back six years, but no, it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019ll be $0.02 positive this time around. Yes we do have a relatively large amount of amortization that rolls off the balance sheet now more so than would have been the case in the past. But the flip side to that of course is that six years ago we would have had more new license sales and the overall sales activity being reflected in the P&L immediately. So I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s necessarily a big difference there in the way the numbers play out, but again I haven\u2019t gone back six years to study how it used to be. ", "Enrique Salem", "One thing I would add though is that we have products in the portfolio that have a higher license yield for example, our Backup Exec business and that would probably have some [inaudible]", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "First just a quick housekeeping, James can you hit us on, you said there would be an impact on the other income from the Huawei joint venture, can you give us a magnitude there? And how that should ramp throughout the year?", "James Beer", "Well no, I\u2019m not going to throw out the specific numbers associated with the Huawei joint venture. I think it\u2019s fair to say when you look at the other income line and think about its primary constituents obviously interest income has been coming down and recent times as interest rates have been reduced around certainly in this country, if not around the world. And then the other thing that\u2019s been happening there is we have a smaller cash balance year-over-year and we\u2019ve been looking to bring in the duration of our investments so that we have more cash available to us to do things like the buyback and to invest in our business in ways such as the Huawei joint venture presented itself. So on the interest expense line, that\u2019s pretty much a constant given the defined nature of the interest associated with the convert of a couple of years ago. And then the additional item this coming year will be the Huawei joint venture and obviously we\u2019ll look to minimize the start-up costs but there I think going to be some of those. ", "Tim Klasell - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Jumping over to Enrique to your comments about focusing in on new license sales, obviously the maintenance streams are very valuable, are you getting a separate sales force or what are you doing to help protect that as your field sales force focuses in on the new license sales?", "Enrique Salem", "We have a number of different things that we do as you know, by segment we have different things that we do but if you look at our storage business we have a team that is focused on renewals and they work very closely with our field force so it\u2019s really a matter of, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re saying there\u2019s no focus or there\u2019s no compensation on the renewal component, its just that we\u2019re putting a higher emphasis on new license and that\u2019s where you really drive the acceleration for our field organization. So we\u2019ve got a combination of things that we\u2019re doing to ensure renewal rates and I don\u2019t expect to see renewal rates in this business drop. If anything given some of the improvements we\u2019re making online in both our small and medium business and in consumer, I expect to see renewals rates continue to improve. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Philip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", "Philip Rueppel - Wachovia Securities", "Quick question on the channel, any changes in management and focus on new personnel, are there any other new initiatives or major initiatives that you\u2019re focusing on in \u201909 that should also have an impact?", "Enrique Salem", "I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019ve made changes on our personnel; we\u2019ve actually been very stable on our channel personnel. The leadership team across the regions has been very stable through fiscal year \u201908 and I expect that to continue. As far as what we\u2019re doing with the channel, we\u2019re always reviewing the various programs and how they work but I don\u2019t expect to see any material changes in fiscal year \u201909 but expect us to continue to look at how do we incent the partners and the channels that drive new business. That is the focus for our company and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to continue to drive incentive around.", "Operator", "That does conclude our question and answer session. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to you Mr. Thompson for any additional or closing remarks.", "John Thompson", "Thank you very much everyone for joining us this afternoon. I\u2019m awfully proud of our teams\u2019 performance not just in the March quarter, but throughout fiscal year \u201908. We had a very strong finishing quarter. We have a very strong pipeline as we head into fiscal year \u201909 and I am very, very encouraged that this is our year.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and Chief Executive Officer, and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "In a moment I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will start with a few comments about our quarterly activities and results, James will then provide financial and operational details, as well as review our guidance as outlined in the press release. Then Enrique will wrap it up with comments about our fiscal year 2010 focus areas. This will be followed by a question and answer session.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations Web site at symantec.com\\invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental information are available on our Web site and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the Investor Relations Web site shortly after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that our June 2008 period results included 14 weeks of activity versus the normal 13 weeks that the June 2009 quarter will have. I\u2019d like to take a moment to review the specific financial details of the extra week. ", "Non-GAAP revenue for the June 2008 quarter included approximately $75.0 million of a one-time benefit and non-GAAP earnings per share included approximately $0.03 of a one-time benefit generated from the extra week. ", "Non-GAAP deferred revenue included a one-time negative impact of approximately $5.0 million from the extra week. ", "We will exclude the impact of the extra week when comparing our 2009 guidance and results to the June 2008 results. ", "Next, we will review our non-GAAP financial results focusing on constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. For the March 2009 quarter the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.30 per Euro and the end of period rate was $1.34 per Euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.32 per Euro. For the March 2008 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.50 per Euro and the end of period rate was $1.58 per Euro. ", "For revenue and operating expense purposes, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. ", "For deferred revenue, results are converted into U.S. dollars at the actual exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. We have included a summary and reconciliation table of the year-over-year growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information.", "Given the rapidly moving exchange rate environment, I\u2019d like to remind everyone to continue to apply the rules of thumb that we have provided as a guide to the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics. ", "For every U.S. cent movement versus the Euro, revenue would be impacted by approximately $4.5 million and deferred revenue would be impacted by approximately $7.0 million. ", "In addition, for every $0.05 U.S. movement versus the Euro, non-GAAP earnings per share would be impacted by approximately $0.01. ", "It is important to note however, that these rules of thumb will move around based on the actual currency fluctuations and the mix of our revenues and expenses. ", "Moving on, some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation, for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company\u2019s most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our web site. ", "And now, I would like to introduce our new CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem. ", "Enrique Salem", "Good afternoon everyone. This quarter marks a solid close to fiscal year 2009. The breadth and depth of our portfolio contributed to the solid results despite the current macroeconomic environment and currency headwinds during the second half of the year. Results for the quarter were driven by strength in enterprise backup, storage management, data loss prevention and consumer. ", "Our strong non-GAAP earnings per share are a result of eliminating unnecessary costs and shifting our spending to areas with the greatest returns. We continue to generate substantial cash flow from operations and strong deferred revenue. Now, I\u2019d like to highlight a few key items of our fiscal fourth quarter.", "In our consumer segment, despite the declining PC units, we continued to strengthen our leadership position as highly publicized threats such as Conficker and Trojan.H have increased consumers\u2019 awareness of the need for security software to protect their personal data. ", "We continue to expand our category leadership by bringing innovative products and services to market. In the March quarter, we shipped Norton 360 version 3.0 that has an ultra-light footprint and fast performance that is the hallmark of our 2009 product line. ", "Norton 360 has already won PC Magazine and Computer Shopper\u2019s Editors Choice Awards. Furthermore, Symantec\u2019s Norton line of products have received top scores from several of the industry\u2019s preeminent, independent testing bodies. ", "In the most recent review from AV-Comparatives, Symantec was the only vendor to be awarded top ratings in all three tested categories: detection; false positives; and performance . ", "Additionally, Symantec has received Virus Bulletin\u2019s  VB 100 Award forty-three consecutive times dating back to 1999. No other competitor has had our record. This record underscores Symantec\u2019s ability to provide the best protection against malware to our customers, something that no other competitor can match. Customer feedback has shown that satisfaction across all areas of the product experience are at an all time high, particularly in the area of performance.", "Despite the market\u2019s emphasis on our relationship with HP, HP represents only one of numerous OEM relationships we have around the world. We have meaningful relationships with HP, Dell, Acer, including Gateway and Packard Bell, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Asus, and Sony, among many others. ", "We continue to aggressively pursue valuable OEM deals, recently winning multiple competitive agreements. We will be shipping on Dell\u2019s global small business line and also their gaming line. We are renewing our relationship with Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPad brand and have also extended our agreement with Acer. ", "In the netbook segment our 2009 products continue to be an attractive choice. In addition to the Asus agreement announced last quarter, we signed contracts to ship NIS on Dell and HP Minis this quarter. ", "Although the price of PCs have steadily fallen over the past decade, security software prices have not. This is due to the fact that it not the cost of the underlying PC but the value of the information and content on the PC that matters.", "Norton Online Backup, which shipped during the quarter, is giving us additional and unique traction with OEMs. We have already signed an agreement to ship a 60-day trial of Norton Online Backup with Sony in Europe. ", "Norton Online Backup also creates a new opportunity to partner with ISPs. We have signed an agreement to provide backup for a major ISP in North America. We currently host over 30 petabytes of customers' data and have more than 7.0 million active customers. That\u2019s 7 x more customers than our nearest competitor. Our Norton Online Backup product allows us to expand beyond traditional security and introduce more consumers to our trusted Norton brand. ", "Next, in our enterprise business, we are seeing the results from our solutions ability to simplify heterogeneous environments and reduce spend by commoditizing infrastructure. In our data center business, the March quarter saw the first results from our Stop Buying Storage! marketing campaign. ", "There are four key opportunities that our customers are benefiting from. Those are: one, storage resource management; two, thin provisioning; three, data de-duplication; and four, intelligent archiving. Our software enables customers to decrease their hardware spend by increasing utilization rates across multiple hardware platforms. ", "The strong sales momentum created by the Stop Buying Storage!' marketing campaign accelerated throughout the quarter, with the teams tracking over 250 specific new enterprise opportunities. ", "Additionally, we are extending our lead in thin provisioning by securing the commitments of the top storage array vendors to support our Storage Foundation Thin Provisioning API\u2019s, including new solutions with Hitachi Data Systems and 3Par Data. ", "Our data center backup and de-duplication products posted strong year-over-year growth. NetBackup, the number one backup solution for the enterprise, continued its strong performance as the market moves to next generation data protection. ", "Our de-duplication product, Puredisk, in particular, performed well during the quarter. Puredisk can reduce total storage required for disk-based backups by over 50 x. ", "Earlier this week, we have started shipping Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition. We expect to improve performance in the mid-market through this product. Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition provides comprehensive protection with simple management capabilities and pre-configured settings that allow small businesses to get up and running quickly. ", "We are working with our partners to make sure that they are fully educated on the benefits of the new product. We believe that this release will enable Symantec Endpoint Protection to extend its success in the large enterprise to the SMB space. ", "Also, in our enterprise security products group, data loss prevention continued its fifth quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Our customers tell us that our products are two years ahead of our competitors\u2019 offerings. Studies have shown that in the market of uncertain job security, data loss prevention has become even more relevant for our customers.", "Additionally, we are now shipping the Altiris Client Management Suite 7.0 and Server Management Suite 7.0. Both management suites utilize workflow technology to provide the necessary automation and integration from a central location to help our customers reduce the time it takes to manage their assets, improve security and reduce operational costs. Both suites are built on the Symantec Management Platform which provides integration across Symantec\u2019s product portfolio and third-party solutions. ", "The workflow engine facilitates integration into the customers\u2019 environment and enables our partners to sell more value-added services.", "Finally, this quarter, Dell began shipping every server with their next generation management console as a native solution that is built on Symantec\u2019s Management Platform. This presents an opportunity to upsell our new Altiris suite as well as many Symantec products that will simply snap in to the platform, including our Backup Exec Information Manager and our Backup Exec System Recovery. ", "Dell Management Console ships with every server Dell sells, further validating Symantec\u2019s strength of technology and architecture. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details before I discuss my focus areas as I look forward to fiscal year 2010.", "James Beer", "The fourth quarter wrapped up a year in which we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of over $6.2 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.57 cents. During fiscal year 2009, we grew earnings per share 24%, increased operating income by 19%, and expanded our non-GAAP operating margin by 360 basis points to 30.2%. ", "These results are reflective of the substantial progress we are making in our efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our cost structure. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, providing us with significant financial flexibility. We exited the March quarter with nearly $2.0 billion of cash on hand reflecting the fact that during the past six months, even during a challenging economic environment, we generated more than $1.0 billion of cash flow from operations. Now, let me get into the details of the fourth quarter.", "Symantec achieved GAAP revenue of $1.47 billion. Non-GAAP revenue grew 2% in constant currency terms versus the March 2008 period, to $1.49 billion. It\u2019s important to note that the U.S. dollar strengthened 13% against other currencies compared to the year ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. ", "As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted non-GAAP revenue by 6 percentage points year-over-year. Had currency effects remained at our guided rate for the March quarter, revenue would have reached $1.495 billion, placing it within our guided range. ", "We generated a total of 369 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each and 85 transactions worth more than $1.0 million during the March quarter as customers adjusted their IT spending as a result of the challenging nature of the current macroeconomic environment. ", "While this was the primary reason for fewer large transactions versus last year and lighter than expected revenue in the quarter, we did see a greater proportion of our sales being recorded on the balance sheet rather than the income statement, reflecting the emphasis during the quarter towards customers renewing maintenance as opposed to buying new licenses. ", "Looking at our geographic results, international non-GAAP revenue of $747.0 million grew 3% in constant currency versus the year ago period, and accounted for 50% of total non-GAAP revenue. ", "Asia Pacific Japan was up 4% in constant currency while North America and EMEA grew 1% and 2% respectively, on a currency-adjusted basis. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to move on to our non-GAAP revenue by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $443.0 million, up 4% in constant currency, versus the March 2008 quarter. ", "Electronic distribution represented 80% of consumer revenue and grew 7% as compared to March 2008, driven primarily by strong activity from our subscription renewals, OEM partnerships and online channels. ", "Norton 360 accounted for 30% of consumer revenue and grew more than 65% versus the year-ago period. ", "The Storage and Server Management group generated revenue of $539.0 million, up 1% in constant currency, compared to the March 2008 results, driven by strong enterprise backup and storage management performance. ", "We\u2019re particularly pleased with the customer reaction to our sales campaign about Stop Buying Storage! It is generating significant business for us given that IT buyers are looking for a clear and quick return on new investments in this economic environment.", "Our Security and Compliance group generated revenue of $370.0 million. The segment declined 9% in constant currency terms. While our mid-market security business continued to be weak, we are encouraged by the release of our new endpoint products that targets this market sector. ", "Our data loss prevention solutions continue to be in high demand as companies address the increasingly important issue of confidential information being misused by employees. ", "Our Services group, which included a full quarter of MessageLabs results, generated revenue of $135.0 million, up 41% in constant currency year-over-year, and represented 9% of our total revenue.", "Turning now to margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 85.7% for the March 2009 quarter, in line with the year-ago quarter.", "Our continuing focus on cost management increased non-GAAP operating margins for the March quarter to 30.5%, up 270 basis points year-over-year. ", "We recorded a GAAP net loss of $249.0 million for the March 2009 quarter as a result of the finalization of the goodwill write down calculation that was previously estimated in our December quarter results. This drove a March quarter charge of approximately $400.0 million. ", "Non-GAAP net income was $318.0 million, up 3%, versus the March 2008 quarter. The March quarter\u2019s fully diluted GAAP loss per share equated to $0.30. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.38, up 6% from the March 2008 quarter, and $0.03 above the high end of our guided range. ", "During the March quarter, we spent $100.0 million to repurchase 7.0 million shares at an average price of $13.84. In total, during fiscal year 2009, we returned $700.0 million to shareholders by repurchasing 42.0 million shares at an average price of $16.53. ", "Our net accounts receivable balance at the end of the March 2009 quarter was $837.0 million. Days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 51 days. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter was $607.0 million, primarily due to strong collections and expense controls. ", "We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.67 billion for the fiscal year.", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of March 2009 was approximately $3.06 billion. Non-GAAP deferred revenue reached $3.08 billion, up 6% in constant currency, as compared to March 2008. Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP deferred revenue versus our guidance. Had foreign exchange remained at the guided rate for the quarter, deferred revenue would have been lower at $3.07 billion, but at the upper end of our guided range. ", "Sequentially, deferred revenue grew by $119.0 million, or by 6% in constant currency. Our financial results will continue to benefit from our strong deferred revenue balance during fiscal year 2010. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the June 2009 quarter. As a reminder, the year ago June quarter included an extra week of activity which we will be stripping out of our comparative commentary as Helyn outlined during her introductory comments. ", "In addition, we are assuming an exchange rate of $1.30 per Euro for the June 2009 quarter versus the $1.56 per Euro we experienced during the June 2008 quarter, equivalent to a 17% currency headwind. ", "Our guidance also assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 830.0 million shares and an effective tax rate of 30.5%. ", "For the June 2009 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.50 billion. ", "Non-GAAP revenue is estimated to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.51 billion, compared to revenue of $1.58 billion after adjusting for the extra week during the June 2008 quarter. ", "At the midpoint of the guided range, we expect revenue growth of approximately 1% in constant currency terms. GAAP earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of between $0.09 and $0.11. ", "The FASB Staff Position 14-1 change in accounting for convertible debt will increase our interest expense during fiscal year 2010 by a total of approximately $100.0 million, or by about $25.0 million per quarter. This accounting change does not affect cash flow. Given that this is a non-cash expense, we will be excluding it from our non-GAAP results. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.34 and $0.36 as compared to $0.37 after adjusting for the benefit of the extra week in June 2008. ", "At the midpoint of the guided range we expect earnings per share growth of approximately 9% in constant currency. At the end of the June quarter we expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.84 and $2.94 billion. ", "We expect non-GAAP deferred revenue to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion as compared to $3.03 billion after adjusting for the negative impact of the extra week in June 2008. ", "At the midpoint of the guided range, we expect deferred revenue to decline 5% sequentially in constant currency, in line with historical seasonal patterns. We expect about 64%, or approximately $955.0 million, of our June quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.", "In closing, the focus in FY2010 will be on balancing investment in key growth areas of the business with effective cost management in order to position the company for long-term success. And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Enrique.", "Enrique Salem", "Now five weeks into my new leadership role, I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss my plans for the new fiscal year. ", "Looking back during John Thompson\u2019s ten years as CEO, Symantec grew annual revenue to $6.0 billion. We remain focused on our vision to secure and manage the world\u2019s information. However, I have a slightly different approach to managing the $6.0 billion business that I have inherited. ", "I plan to use the scale that John built and focus our investments to increase internal innovation, to improve quality, and further integrate our solutions. We will extend our market leadership position in security, backup, and storage management. ", "On the product side, I am pleased with our leadership and performance in our storage management and consumer businesses. For fiscal year 2010, I have established three key product focus areas for our team: first, responding to customer needs in enterprise security; second, capitalizing on the migration to next generation data protection; and third, offering our products through the software-as-a-service model. ", "In enterprise security, in addition to the Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition which allows us to better serve the mid-market, we are now shipping Symantec Protection Suites 3.0 in small business and enterprise editions. ", "The suite creates an endpoint and messaging environment that is secure against today's complex malware, data loss and spam threats, and is quickly recoverable in the event of a failure, thereby controlling costs and managing risk. ", "Moreover, the suites are easy to deploy and simple to use, saving customers time and costs associated with securing their IT environment. The most recent Conficker virus provides a perfect illustration of the core Symantec vision \u2013 the unification of security and management. ", "We can enable our customers to identify their systems that need to be patched, deliver the patches, update their SEP signatures, and validate that they are indeed secure using our compliance tools. ", "Additionally, we can manage the frequency of backups to protect critical data in times of high threat levels. We are the only vendor who can bring this complete offering to the market.", "Second, we will solidify our leadership in the data protection business as we transition and help our customers move to next generation technologies which include disk-based backup, virtualization support, continuous data protection, and de-duplication. ", "We expect to sell more of these next generation technologies as NetBackup 5.0 customers on maintenance continue to transition to NetBackup 6.5 which enables more disk-based options. ", "Additionally, in February, we announced that backup and archiving will be combined under the same management. NetBackup, Backup Exec, and Enterprise Vault are the clear market leaders in the enterprise and mid-market backup and the archiving market segments, respectively. ", "We will leverage our technology strength in backup and archiving to simplify administration and reduce costs for our customers. Our Backup Exec product will have built in de-duplication and archiving option powered by the Enterprise Vault technology, which is expected to ship later this year. ", "Software-as-a-Service is our third product focus area. We acquired MessageLabs, the leader in SaaS messaging security in November 2008. Our integration is going smoothly, and we plan to utilize our existing technology and the MessageLabs platform to create new SaaS and hybrid offerings to include archiving, DLP, backup, and many other services. ", "Our goal is to offer customers the flexibility to manage their business using online services, onsite software, or hybrid onsite and online solutions. This is especially attractive in the current macroeconomic environment as SaaS is a delivery method that enables many companies to improve IT spend. ", "In closing, I believe that we have the leading position in key markets, and customers see the value of our product portfolio and the benefits of our products and services. ", "In addition to our focus areas, we will not lose sight of improving execution in the forms of maintaining our leading market share, improving customer and partner loyalty, and becoming more operationally efficient. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Helyn so that she can take your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "While Tom is polling for questions, I\u2019d like to update you on a few upcoming events. First, Symantec will be hosting our financial analyst day on June 11th in San Francisco. We encourage you to register for the event by May 22nd in order to capture the discounted hotel rate. ", "Second, we will be presenting at the JP Morgan conference on May 19th. And finally, we will be reporting our fiscal first quarter results on July 29th, 2009. ", "For a complete list of all of the investor-related events, please visit our events calendar on the Investor Relations Web site. We are ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "If I could turn to the security and compliance division, clearly that looks a little weaker than the rest. Enrique, aside from mid-market weakness, what else might be going on in there and is there any concern on headcount reductions actually starting to weigh on things like end points, pricing, etc?", "Enrique Salem", "I think when I look at that segment I would say there's a couple of things going there. One, you mentioned mid-market, and we just shipped the new products on Monday, which I think will help us there. ", "I think the second area is we do have the currency headwind that Helyn outlined in the beginning but in the high end of the market, we are continuing to see the same close rate that we had seen in previous quarters and I do believe that the demand for DLP, which is continuing to show double-digit growth over the last five quarters, I expect that to continue because that's a product that our customers will continue to say is very important to what they're doing, even in this tougher economic environment.", "But I would highlight the currency headwinds and the mid-market as the two areas that I think have weighed on that segment.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "And James, just a follow-up on the margin side. Your guidance looks like you're assuming margins will contract sequentially and even year-over-year. What would be the key driver of that? Are there any incremental costs that happen in June that we should be thinking about or is that just trying to allow for currency and some conservatism?", "James Beer", "Obviously, year-over-year the cost base now includes the companies that we have acquired within the back half of the year, so Message Labs and PC Tools being the primary items there.", "So sequentially for June versus March we go back to our full accrual, if you will, on commissions so there's an implied increase in the forecast for that line versus what we experienced in the March quarter, in which we came in lighter than we had expected.", "So those are the primary drivers year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "So you're still thinking about a cost base that is being kept a tight rein on, given the headcount reduction and . . .", "James Beer", "Oh, I think these results are quite reflection of the progress that we're making on the cost side of the ledger and I'm very pleased by that and we're absolutely continuing our focus there, to be able to build margin points 360 points year-over-year. We're very pleased with that. That's really more than we had initially expected we would be able to achieve when we started out this journey in FY2009 and it's something that's just a part of the way we do business now at Symantec. I would not see us changing our emphasis here at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Heather Bellini \u2013 UBS.", "Heather Bellini - UBS", "I was wondering if I could follow-up on Sarah's question about operating margins for a moment. She was talking about Q1. I'm kind of interested in full year, to the extent that you can share with us anything there, because in the past you did a great job expanding margin this year in fiscal 2009. You've been talking about 100 basis points a year. Given the currency headwind that you face, in particular in the first half of fiscal 2010 is that possible on a reported basis, is there anything you can tell us there?", "And then the other would be, just looking at gross margin, can you give us an idea of how should we thinking about gross margins trending over the course of fiscal 2010 as well.", "James Beer", "In terms of the operating margins goals, we are always talking about 100 basis points a year as being a long-term target, and clearly we over-performed that in fiscal 2009, which I think was very good, particularly given the constraints around the top line.", "Now we have also said that obviously, just mathematically, it is easier to expand operating margins in an environment where you have a robust top line, and in this macroeconomic environment that is going to be more of a challenge in any one particular year.", "The other thing I would say though, is something that Enrique was focusing on in his remarks in that we are really looking to try to find that right blend between investing in the areas of our business where we think we can generate real growth and at the same time keeping a very sharp focus on cost effectiveness and efficiency.", "So it will be a blend of those themes as we proceed through fiscal 2010 but we will be working hard on margins just as we did in this past year.", "As to gross margins, we have made some nice improvements there in the last couple of years as well and I wouldn't expect there to be any particular movements one way or another. The biggest drivers of gross margin for us are support costs and services cost. ", "And in the services arena we have made nice progress in terms of margins in the last two years. Obviously that rate of improvement becomes more difficult as the years go by.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Bank of America.", "Kash Rangan - Bank of America", "One question for you, Enrique. On the storage side you indicated that the Stop Buying Storage! message was starting to resonate and produce results. So should we sort of infer that the trajectory that you started out with this quarter, that gets better? In other words, the growth rate could potentially improve as a result of that? Maybe you can talk to that.", "And also, James, a question for you. As Message Labs gets reported in the services line item, how does that change the margin profile of the services business going forward?", "Enrique Salem", "When you think about the Stop Buying Storage! marketing campaign, what's happening is customers are coming to us and saying they absolutely are trying to manage their capital expenditures and one of the best areas for them to target is the area of storage. And so I think what you can expect is our customers try to take advantage of some of the concepts like intelligent archiving and provisioning, storage resource management, and data de-duplication, that that will benefit the various lines because as you look at the functionality I just mentioned, some of that is delivered by our NetBackup tier disc capability, some of it is delivered by our enterprise product and so we see that the Stop Buying Storage! campaign will allow those products to continue to perform at their current levels, given this tougher environment.", " And so I think that campaign is what's going to help us be able continue to drive the performance that we have seen over the last several quarters.", "James Beer", "And as to the impact of Message Labs on the services margins, I would expect them to improve the margins in that segment. You may recall, we have had a lot of focus in the last couple of years on improving margins in the services segment anyway. But Message Labs, as we increase scale there, which is obviously very much our intent, I think there will be the opportunity to expand its own operating margin. So I would look for a continuing improving trajectory of services margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "I had a couple of questions about the consumer business. I was hoping maybe you could talk about some of the key drivers of that business. Did 360 improve as a percentage of total bookings in the quarter, were average selling prices up in the quarter, and as you think about the next couple of quarters for the consumer business, you noted that the PC market had been weak, which it obviously was. Should we be thinking that a recovery in the PC market is key to getting growth in that business going forward or do you think that business will grow as you continue to expand some the OEM relationships and drive some of the new products.", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at Norton 360, we are definitely continuing to see the mix shift towards 360, and you know, we started out very quickly with 360 moving up but that has moderated a little bit because customers who are using Norton Internet Security are obviously very happy with that product and so while we continue to see the move towards 360, that mix rate has slowed down just a little bit. We do benefit from the higher price point of 360 over NIS. ", "Now to your question of the PC unit shipment, I think what we're doing is we're continuing to add other capabilities. I highlighted today that we have now started shipping Norton Online Backup and so even with the kind of slower number of PC units being shipped, I think we can maintain where we are today and even can see a positive, given that we are seeing the mix shift and the addition of the new offering. My sense, though, is the other thing that's benefitting us right now and just talking to our consumer team, is given the reception of the new products, meaning Norton Internet Security with the very fast performance and the great customer experience and now Norton 360 version 3, while we don't break out the renewal rates, we are seeing some improvement in renewals as a result of the great products that we have put into the marketplace. ", "And that is also helping us attract some of the new OEMs that I highlighted in the call because people are looking for that improved customer experience.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "I just wanted to touch on the storage business. When you look at just the way the economic impact is across your businesses, I wondered if you could comment on storage. [inaudible] segment, just curious what you're seeing there when you look across, particularly across your two main products, you know, at the high end of NetBackup and then Backup Exec.", "Enrique Salem", "We are seeing continued strength in both NetBackup and Storage Management. What's great is given that data volumes continue to grow at a very rapid rate, that's actually benefitting the NetBackup product line and we saw that perform very well through the entire fiscal year. ", "When we look at the Storage Management side, given the Stop Buying Storage! campaign, what we've actually seen is that product also continues to be a part of what customers are trying to do to improve storage utilization and basically help them get much better return on the storage they've already purchased.", "And so we do believe that both NetBackup and Storage Foundation, or Storage Management, will continue to do well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Difucci - JP Morgan.", "John Difucci - JP Morgan", "The first question is for James and then one for Enrique. James, you said the focus by customers was to renew maintenance contracts here, but when I look at it, it looks to me as if maintenance declined both sequentially and year-over-year. And what I'm doing is I'm looking at your supplemental and you give content subscription and maintenance and I take out services, consumer, and then I add back the non-GAAP, which is maintenance.", "I'm just curious, I guess what would maintenance have done sequentially, excluding foreign exchange, or am I doing something wrong here?", "James Beer", "Well, what I would say, well, we can get into more of the specifics perhaps offline, but what I would say here is that clearly you saw the security and compliance part of the business was where we saw a currency adjusted decline, 9% or so. Now clearly, that's not helpful to the maintenance volume necessarily, quarter-to-quarter. ", "But stepping back from that, that's just one component of the enterprise business. I was very pleased with pricing around maintenance, and I was very pleased with renewal rates around maintenance. So those really are the important themes, whereas we did see absolutely less license, new sales, customers really pulling back from longer-term investments, if you will, in favor of the short-term needs.", "John Difucci - JP Morgan", "What is the renewal rate about, for you?", "James Beer", "We don't quote the renewal rates, either for the consumer business or the enterprise business, but we are very pleased with where they are.", "Enrique Salem", "We're not seeing any change in renewal rates, quite frankly. And one of the questions that Sarah asked right at the beginning was around specifically is the unemployment having an impact on our total units. And so we're not seeing a change in renewal rates or that the unemployment rate is having an impact on the business.", "John Difucci - JP Morgan", "And Enrique, a follow-up for you, when we look at these goodwill impairment breakdowns over the last couple of quarters, I'm just curious, is this going to have any influence on your acquisition strategy going forward? And I guess could you just state what your strategy is going to be?", "Enrique Salem", "I think if you look at it, I'm in no real rush to start doing acquisitions. Part of the focus that I've given the team, is you know, we have a tremendous engineering capability. I want to drive internal innovation. ", "Now that doesn't mean that we will not do acquisitions. That's one of the advantages of having the cash flow direction and balance sheet that we do. But I'm going to stay focused inside the markets that we are in. I mean, we clearly have a big position in security, I want to look at opportunities to strengthen our position there. ", "I want to look for opportunities in some of the next generation data protection, I want to look for opportunities in what we're doing around data categorization, and so as I look at the acquisition strategy, I'm in no rush to go do a lot of acquisitions. There may be some small things that strengthen our position in a few of those markets. And then longer term I'll look for what makes sense as far as continuing to drive growth into the company.", "But right now, we can afford to be patient.", "John Difucci - JP Morgan", "Just one follow-up to that. Veritas, when it was independent, had a big push into what it called utility computing and now people are talking about it as if it\u2014they are calling it cloud computing today. And they bought Adjacent and Jeriva and there seems to be a big push internally and we just don't hear about it as much anymore. Is that still a meaningful effort within Symantec or is that something that has sort of gone a little sideways?", "Enrique Salem", "I would say that the focus areas are software-as-a-service and not necessarily\u2014what historically utility computing, which is maybe morphed in title, what we would do is we would see some of core Veritas products, board foundation, our new clustering VCS1 technology, as helping kind of build the infrastructure for utility computing and then we see delivering on top of that infrastructure our software-as-a-service capability. And so from our perspective the priorities and investment area is our security, next-generation data protection, and software-as-a-service.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Ives \u2013 FBR Capital Markets.", "Daniel Ives \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Could you talk about the linearity in the quarter and maybe talk about what trends you're seeing in the month of April?", "Enrique Salem", "I think when you look at linearity, and we track close rates, we did some analysis on that and what we're seeing is consistency in the close rates, nothing new from a linearity perspective. On the enterprise business, on large enterprise business, it still tends to be a good percentage of the business comes in the last two weeks of the quarter. In our mid-market business it's steadier throughout the quarter. Our consumer business obviously, both a bookings and revenue recognition basis, is fairly consistent across the entire quarter.", "So we didn't see any real changes in the March quarter and we haven't seen anything so far in the June quarter. It just continues to be pretty consistent along the percentages. And we just finished the month of April and from the analysis James and I, it seems to be on track, similar to what we've seen in previous Aprils.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Following on Daniels' question, with linearity on track, can you talk about where the surprises in the quarter that drove FX-adjusted revenue to the low end of guidance. Was it more of the maintenance rather than license or was there something else in there?", "Enrique Salem", "You're on track there because what we saw was a couple of things. Historically, in our business, we have seen longer-term deals, we've seen terms that are three-year deals and we saw that become folks buying what they need for the current year or the next 12 months, not necessarily pre-buying for years two and three. So I think that's one thing that we saw.", "And I do think that when you look at the overall business, I think given that we've now shipped the new mid-market product, I think that will definitely help because that's been an area we've been successful. With the large enterprise we have gotten a number of competitive wins but we have not had the same success in the mid-market. ", "So the combination of shorter terms and I think we have continued to see, without having the new Symantec EndPoint Protection and the new suites, we haven't gotten the results that I would have liked in the mid-market. But I expect that to change now that we are with the new products.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "And the follow-on to that, so now that you are shipping the new mid-market product and the Protection Suite 3.0, when should that either stabilize the security business or once again grow the security business?", "Enrique Salem", "My expectation is we are ramping up our partners right now and so the partners are starting to understand the capabilities of the product, the simplicity of it. And my sense is, that given it shipped on Monday of this week, I would expect that you will start seeing the results from that capability probably in the September quarter. I will have a full quarter of having been in the channel. Because if we are putting it out at the beginning of this week, you probably want get it into the channel for the next several weeks.", "James Beer", "And just a follow-up on the first part of Enrique's answer, obviously we were pleased to be able to exceed, on an FX-adjusted basis even, the consensus estimate for deferred revenue, while we came in light on revenue versus consensus. So that's very much reinforcing this notion of more on the activity going to the balance sheet this quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brent Thill - Citi Investment Research.", "Brent Thill - Citi Investment Research", "Enrique, your operating margin performance has really outpaced the top line performance at the high level. Do you feel like you're re-shifting your focus back on top line growth and you'd rather trade off lower operating margins, or less operating margin expansion, to get that revenue growth coming back over the next couple of years?", "Enrique Salem", "When I think about it, James commented earlier, you know, our long-term goal is to drive 100 basis points of margin improvement. And we still see an opportunity to stay on track to do that. I think that this year, as I look at the combination of some of the investments that we need to make around the opportunities in consumer, security, in the enterprise, FAS, software-as-a-service, and also our next-generation data protection as customers move from a tape to disc-based backup, I think it's going to be important that we put some investments in those areas.", "I do continue to believe, though, that there are always opportunities for us to continue to manage our cost structure and so I think it will be a combination of yes, we will move dollars to the areas I just mentioned, but we will also continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs in other areas. ", "So I don't want to back off in any way from our long-term goal of 100 basis points of margin improvement.", "Brent Thill - Citi Investment Research", "We've seen other software companies achieve pretty good success with this suite-based approach. Can you just walk through what you're hoping to achieve and have you had history doing this historically or do you consider a brand new initiative?", "Enrique Salem", "The way I look at is historically we've been shipping a suite but I would call it a suite on malware protection. So we would ship EndPoint Security, mail-based, you know the mail server security, the gateway security, and what we're doing now is we're adding the other applications that we have. So we've had market leading e-mail security for anti-spam protection. We acquired a small company called MI5 that adds to our Web security capability. ", "And so what we're doing is in an effort to serve the mid-market and the SMB segments better, we believe that bringing these products together in an integrated suite, we are extending the suites we had previously, is the right way to go.", "So the suites are new from a capability perspective but we've been delivering a suite that was focused on one particular type of product line. So from our perspective, it's going to be something that allows us just to go right back into our channel partners and go leverage our field organization just to have a new set of capabilities that I will have a positive impact on our security business. And I expect to start seeing that, as I mentioned, in the September quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to dig in on the consumer business a little bit further. Can you give us any sense, I know you talked about the new OEM partnerships coming on stream, but can you give us any sense in terms of where you think you stand on OEM boxes going out the door today versus a year ago?", "And can you also walk us through what happens to an OEM relationship when it does not renew? What happens to that legacy customer base from an economic perspective?", "Enrique Salem", "Let me take the second part first. Every relationship is structured differently, and so it depends on what we are doing. So for example, some of our agreements are what I would call a placement fee and then we get everything into the future. Some deals are structured as rev shares and they have tails post-termination. So it really depends on the overall structure of that OEM agreement.", "Now to your first question, we are absolutely\u2014you heard what we just talked about, we won a number of OEM deals in the last quarter. I mean, working with the ThinkPad brand, working with some extensions with Dell around SMB and their gaming platforms and so we definitely see that the numbers of units in the OEM market that we are associated with is definitely up.", "The other thing that I commented on, which I think is important, we were already on the Asus netbook and then we're now on both the Dell and HP Minis. And so we feel that on an overall basis the numbers of units shipping with our product is moving up right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Company.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Company", "First, James, just on the segments it looked like R&D was a bit above and sales and marketing was a bit below in terms of where we were thinking expenses would come in. Just wondering with Enrique talking about a little more focus on organic development, should we expect that this level of R&D spending is somewhat of a baseline going forward?", "James Beer", "Well, as he mentioned earlier, we'll absolutely be targeting specific spend into some specific areas of R&D, in line with those priorities that he was laying out. But at the same time we are working hard to make more efficient the other elements of the R&D cost base. So it will be a mixture of those two themes going forward here.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Company", "And Enrique, you talked about a few focus areas, mostly on the product side. I'm wondering if that has any bearing on the go-to-market strategy and if there is any meaningful change as you go into fiscal 2010 here given that you sharpened some of the focus on the product side?", "Enrique Salem", "I think when I look at the go-to-market side one of the things that I'm most pleased with right now is I have been spending a lot of time with our channel partners and what I see is there is a lot of enthusiasm for the new work flow technology that we shipped with our Altiris Client Management and Server Management suites. ", "What it's enabling our partners to do is create their own intellectual property that they can then take back into their customer base. And the reason that is important for them is because they are really being able to price the \"V\" in value to our customers using the work flow technology. That I think is going to be meaningful, because as you know, given our renewed push in security and the efforts in the mid-market, partners are critical.", "And so I think the effect of the suites and the work flow technology will bring a lot of partners or bring a lot of enthusiasm for our partner community. At least that's the feedback that I'm getting right now.", "From an overall go-to-market, you know we are continuing to push our leadership around security and next-generation data protection so you can expect to see marketing pushing those campaigns, Stop Buying Storage! campaign, and we've also made some adjustments on the comp plan but overall it's pretty consistent year-to-year, with a little bit more emphasis on security as we go into fiscal year 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Klassel - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Tim Klassel - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Could you give us an idea of the impact you're having with the PC Tools acquisition and you know, that was a new segment of the market that you were going after. What's been the success there today?", "Enrique Salem", "What we're seeing with PC Tools is, you've got it exactly right, we're going after a couple of different target markets. One is a different segment so a more price-sensitive buyer, and two is emerging markets where quite frankly, they're looking for, probably again, more price-sensitive. ", "We are pleased with the integration. That's been completed successfully. The leadership team, we've got a leader who is running that, somebody who has been a long-time Symantec employee, and I am pleased with the progress we've made. I expect to see that business continue to expand because there's a number of segments that I believe are price sensitive that we haven't yet tapped into and so I believe at this point that we've just started to see the initial possibilities of PC Tools and I think the dual-brand strategy is absolutely going to serve us well, especially when we think about markets like Asia, the market in China. And so from my perspective, that strategy is on track and I expect to see it perform even better as we go into fiscal 2010.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Enrique, in your comments you talked about netbook and the fact that it's more about the value of the information. I was wondering if you could tell us or help us understand quantitatively what you're seeing. Are you seeing the OEM adoption rates stay the same on netbooks? Or what gives you that confidence that netbooks won't hurt the consumer side?", "Enrique Salem", "Asus was the first one that we shipped. We are getting right now to the end of the trial period so we are starting to get a little bit of data and what we're doing is we're comparing the data that we get on the netbook or Mini lines, to the underlying adoption of the software for their non-netbook lines. And we don't have enough data yet to give you a conclusive answer but what I have seen is that absolutely prices in hardware have been dropping for the last ten years. And prices of our software, quite frankly, have increased over the last ten years, or at least over the last couple of years. We have been able to move people to Norton 360.", "So I think that clearly highlights the point that it's not the price of the hardware that matters, it's what you're doing. And when I talk to a lot of the manufacturers and they talk about the user scenarios, you know, kids potentially them to go online, people are very concerned about what the online usage is going to look like. And I think Norton Internet Security and Norton 360 will absolutely continue to do well in that lineup of netbooks and Minis.", "Operator", "That does conclude the Q&A session. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique Salem", "Well, thanks for attending today's earnings call. I'm excited about the opportunity to lead Symantec and moving forward our focus is on investments that will extend our leadership, improve product quality, and integrate our solutions to help customers secure and manage their information. ", "As we continue to focus I want to make sure that we improve execution and drive operational efficiencies as many of you have commented, and I definitely look forward to spending time with you over the next couple of weeks and look forward to seeing you at our analyst day in June.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

We are encouraged by the signs we see of stabilization in the markets we serve. This gives us confidence that we will continue to see gradual improvement in our business over the next few quarters. Challenges remain, however, for some customers in the SMB segment and in certain regions around the world. ", "A focus on a clear set of priorities helped us deliver solid results in Q2. Of these, the first of these priorities is to strengthen our leadership in security, the second is to capitalize on the migration to next generation data protection, and the third is to help our customers commoditize infrastructure. The fourth is to deliver SaaS-based solutions to our customers. Our commitment to consistent execution underpins these priorities. ", "We started to see initial signs of progress in SMB security as we renewed our relationships with channel partners given the launch of our new security products. We also saw strength in the consumer segment as our business continues to benefit from our market-leading products. ", "One of the metrics that we use to track customer and partner loyalty is the Net Promoter Score. We've seen improving Net Promoter Scores across our business segments and geographies, and we believe that this is a positive leading indicator for our business going forward. This quarter our enterprise security business customers noted that we\u2019ve simplified the installation and improved product performance. Additionally, our partners highlighted improvements in ease of doing business with Symantec. We continue to use the Net Promoter Score feedback to deliver differentiated and improved experiences for our customers and partners. ", "Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the highlights from the quarter:", "The strength of our Consumer business was driven by strong Norton 360 sales and by our relationships with eight of the top nine OEMs. In mid-September, we launched our Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus 2010 products, further distancing ourselves from the competition. These products leverage our new reputation-based security technology, code named Quorum, to deliver unmatched detection of new malware. ", "The 2010 Norton security products have already received top reviews from respected independent testing bodies including AV-Comparatives.org, AV-Test.org, and Dennis Technology Labs. The Dennis report showed that Norton Internet Security 2010 was the only product tested that achieved a perfect 100% detection rate against increasingly prevalent zero-day threats due to our exclusive reputation-based security technology. In contrast, the report noted that the average detection rate across all products tested was 78%. Our 2009 products won over 150 awards, and we believe our new products will match or exceed that achievement. ", "We have many opportunities to grow our business through a variety of channels and around the world and are not dependant on any one partner or channel. During the quarter, we won consumer online backup deals with Toshiba and Acer. We now have backup relationships with four of the top five OEMs. We also extended our Norton Security Scan distribution agreement with Adobe Shockwave and added to our ISP partnerships with a win at EMOBILE, one of Japan\u2019s largest mobile broadband service providers. We expanded our relationships with major French retailers and with Dixons, a major European-based retailer. We continue to focus on profitable partnerships across all channels and to enter into transactions that make economic sense for us given our leadership position. ", "PC Tools allows us to broaden our access to new markets and strengthen our on-line capabilities. Our 2010 version of Spyware Doctor with Antivirus recently won PC Magazine\u2019s Editors\u2019 Choice Award in the anti-spyware category. We have been able to leverage our Norton relationships to win additional business for PC Tools in new channels. For example, PC Tools displaced a competitor at a leading Australian retailer which also carries Norton products. The combination of both brands enables Symantec to reach all consumer segments. ", "Additionally, in the online channel, Spyware Doctor Starter Edition has been selected as the only security product for the Google Pack. This relationship enables us to gain access to Google\u2019s 165 million unique visitors. ", "Finally, we are beginning the migration of our Norton customers to our new, Symantec-developed and operated online store. We are carefully monitoring the transition and are pleased with the progress so far. Establishing ecommerce as a core competency for Symantec will give us better visibility to develop targeted programs and deliver more innovative products and services, as well as realize operational efficiencies and improve our cash flow and earnings per share. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn to our Enterprise business. During the quarter we won a number of competitive enterprise deals where we were able to cross sell new products and services to our existing customers. ", "We saw a continuation of last quarter\u2019s behavior in our storage business. Instead of seeing customers make upfront purchases of licenses for future growth, a majority continued to buy for their current needs. ", "In addition, server market deceleration continued to put pressure on this part of the business, particularly in new license sales on the Sun platform. Having said that, we have seen the decline in new license sales stabilize, and maintenance renewals on our large installed base remain strong. ", "We continue to sell across all platforms due to our growing partnerships with IBM and HP, as well as our focus on long-term growth areas such as Windows and Linux. ", "Our Stop Buying Storage campaign continues to resonate well with customers. They value our unique ability to reduce storage costs by better utilizing existing storage and by commoditizing hardware. ", "As customers are challenged to keep costs down while managing increasing volumes of unstructured data, many are turning to scalable high-performance cloud storage solutions. Our FileStore solution, released this month, capitalizes on this trend. FileStore enables customers to scale their environments at a lower cost through operational efficiencies and the commoditization of hardware. ", "The product integrates natively with our NetBackup and Endpoint Protection solutions, eliminating additional server requirements for backup and security \u2013 something no other competitor offers. Our product has the fastest performance benchmarks according to a third party test. Customers such as Taobao - China's largest online auction site, selling over 4.5 million items per day - are already using FileStore technology to support their businesses.", "Now moving on to our backup and recovery products, NetBackup, the number one information management solution for the enterprise, delivered steady performance as customers moved to next generation data protection. For example, we won a large multi-year contract with a global financial institution which included backup and archiving as well as storage, endpoint management and multiple service offerings. ", "Earlier this month we began shipping NetBackup PureDisk 6.6, which includes several new features such as de-duplication for VMware and Oracle as well as granular restore functionality for Microsoft Exchange. This release allows us to further help customers reduce data volumes, complexity and infrastructure costs. ", "In our Enterprise Security business, we are continuing to see traction in the large enterprise segment with several competitive displacements. For example, at a large U.S. telecommunications company we leveraged the full value of our product portfolio to deliver a consolidated solution of security, compliance, storage and backup products. ", "In the mid-market, we continue to engage and educate our partners on the Small Business Edition of Symantec Endpoint Protection, which was launched in May. During the quarter, enrollment in our SMB Specialization program exceeded our expectations. We are pleased with our first full quarter of Small Business Edition bookings. As you know, this activity will benefit our revenue over the next twelve months. We expect this trend to continue as increasing numbers of our channel partners become trained on our products. ", "We posted double-digit growth in our Federal business as the fiscal year for the U.S. federal government came to a close. For example, we won a multi-year contract with a government organization which includes DLP and mail security solutions. ", "Internationally, in a partnership with Volvo IT, we won a competitive displacement at the City of Stockholm for approximately 145,000 seats. ", "Another key initiative, Software-as-a-Service, posted sequential growth as we continue to leverage cross-selling opportunities for our online security solutions within the Symantec customer base. We saw increased sales of our hosted web security offering as web-based attacks remain a leading source of new infections. ", "Now I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to discuss the progress we've made over the past six months on improving sales force productivity and integrating technologies into core products. ", "In a focused effort to increase overall sales productivity, we continue to improve account planning, deal review and resource utilization in order to drive higher close rates. These improvements, coupled with marketing campaign alignment, enable our sales force to focus on customer relationships and cross-sell the portfolio into the installed base. ", "We continue to focus on producing high-quality integrated products and look forward to several upcoming offerings. We expect to launch our BackupExec System Recovery 2010 product with our new virtualization and Linux options for the SMB market by the end of the year. In addition, we expect to release Symantec Data Loss Prevention 10 in December with the industry\u2019s first open DLP platform, integrating our hosted email services. ", "We expect BackupExec 2010, scheduled to be available by the end of our fiscal year, to include integrated add-on options and de-duplication and archiving capabilities. Plans for NetBackup 7.0 include an integrated de-duplication add-on option which will allow de-duplication directly on the media server and is also expected to be released by fiscal year end. Both of these releases provide options that we will be able to sell to new and current customers and should benefit our cross-selling capabilities in fiscal 2011. ", "We are focused on delivering industry leading products, integrating technology, cross-selling the portfolio and improving sales force productivity. I am confident that we have laid the foundation for solid execution during the second half of our fiscal year. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to James for a review of the our financial results. James?", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone.", "I'm pleased to report that Symantec achieved solid second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics, both on an as-reported basis and after adjusting for foreign exchange. Despite a tight IT spending environment, our business continues to generate strong cash flow, while our focus on cost management resulted in better-than-expected earnings. ", "Now, I'll review the financial details of the September quarter. Unless otherwise noted, all of the growth rates I will be discussing have been adjusted to take account of currency effects. ", "Non-GAAP revenue was $1.48 billion and declined 2% versus the September 2008 period. We are encouraged by the improving trends in our maintenance revenues and by the sequential stabilization of our license revenue. The Consumer business continued to perform well, while our Enterprise Security business also improved sequentially. And we are encouraged by the initial signs of progress in the mid-market security segment. ", "We saw better than expected results from our public sector vertical, especially in North America, and increased volumes from financial services and telecommunications companies. ", "The U.S. dollar strengthened 3% against the euro as compared to the year ago period, reducing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted non-GAAP revenue by 1 percentage point year-over-year or by $14 million. However, currency effects positively impacted revenue as compared to the guidance we provided on July 29th. Had currency effects remained at our guided rate for the September quarter, non-GAAP revenue would have been $1.46 billion, still above our guided range.", " ", "Looking at our geographic results, international non-GAAP revenue of $750 million represented 51% of the total and was equal to the year ago period. The Asia/Pacific/Japan region was up 3%, while the Europe/Middle East/Africa region declined 1% and the Americas declined 4%. ", "Now I\u2019d like to move on to our non-GAAP revenue by segment. ", "The Consumer business generated revenue of $465 million, up 6% versus the September 2008 quarter. This is the second quarter in a row that the consumer business has generated 6% year-over-year growth and illustrates the positive impact our industry-leading products and dual-brand strategy are having on our results. ", "Electronic distribution represented approximately 80% of Consumer revenue. Our premium priced Norton 360 suite now accounts for 35% of Consumer revenue, having grown 43% versus the reported results in the year ago period. Our action to bring our ecommerce store in-house will further bolster consumer revenue and cash flow growth in the future. ", "Across our Enterprise business, we generated a total of 279 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each - up 7% sequentially - and 70 transactions worth more than $1 million each, up 32% sequentially. ", "The Storage and Server Management Group generated revenue of $563 million, declining 8% as compared to the September 2008 quarter. This year-over-year change was in line with the June quarter results, driven by the continuation of the customer buying behavior that we discussed last quarter and by the decline in server sales. ", "Our Security and Compliance Group generated revenue of $348 million, down 1% year-over-year. Endpoint security posted good sequential growth as more Enterprise customers purchased our protection suite and our new small business edition started to penetrate the SMB segment. ", "We are pleased by the strong net promoter scores reported by customers and partners for our new SMB product. ", "Our Services business unit generated revenue of $103 million, equal to the September 2008 quarter result. We saw growth in our Consulting and Managed Security Services segments. We continue to focus on improving the cost efficiency of our Services operations and we\u2019re pleased with the contribution improvements that the group has made during the past few quarters. ", "Turning now to margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 85.9% for the September 2009 quarter, up 20 basis points as compared to the year ago period. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 29.2% was equal to the result generated during the September 2008 quarter, driven by disciplined expense management.

", "We exited the September quarter with a cash position of approximately $2.3 billion. ", "Cash flow from operating activities generated $226 million in the September quarter, and we spent $120 million to repurchase 7.9 million shares at an average price of $15.22. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and committed to returning value to our shareholders. As a result, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. ", "Our net accounts receivable balance at the end of the September quarter was $688 million. Days sales outstanding or DSO was 42 days. ", "Non-GAAP deferred revenue at the end of the September 2009 quarter was $2.91 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by strong maintenance billings. Foreign currency movements positively impacted non-GAAP deferred revenue versus our guidance. Had foreign exchange remained at the guided rate for the quarter, deferred revenue would have been $2.86 billion, still above our guided range. ", "Now I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2009 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.47 per euro versus the $1.32 per euro we experienced during the December 2008 quarter, equivalent to approximately an 11% currency tailwind. ", "Also, note that the end-of-period rate for the December 2008 quarter was $1.39 per euro, equivalent to approximately a 6% currency tailwind versus our $1.47 per euro assumption. ", "Our guidance also assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 820 million shares and an effective tax rate of 29.5%. ", "Recent movements in several key exchange rates have changed the rules of thumb we provide to assist analysts in estimating the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial metrics as follows - for each one cent strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar we now estimate that we receive a revenue benefit of $4 million versus the previous $4.5 million benefit. ", "Similarly, operating expenses rise by about $3 million rather than $2 million, and therefore it takes a $0.10 strengthening of the euro to generate an incremental $0.01 of earnings per share versus the previous rule of thumb, which only required a $0.05 strengthening of the euro. ", "There is no change to the deferred revenue rule of thumb of $7 million for each $.01 movement of the euro. ", "For the December 2009 quarter we expect non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.485 to $1.515 billion as compared to revenue of $1.54 billion during the December 2008 quarter. ", "At the midpoint of the guided range, we expect revenue to decline by approximately 2.5% year-over-year. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 and $0.37 as compared to $0.42 in the year ago period. Approximately $0.02 of dilution is related to our new ecommerce solution, while another $0.02 of dilution is related to a projected increase in OEM PC unit shipments, which in turn results in higher placement fees being incurred by Symantec during the December quarter. Clearly, higher-than-expected PC unit shipments bode well for our Consumer business over the long-run. ", "We continue to expect that our operating margins for FY '10 will decline between 100 and 150\u00a0basis points as compared to FY '09, as we stated on our previous earnings call.

(Operator Instructions) ", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. ", "We will be presenting at the following conferences this quarter: Lazard, NASDAQ in London, Credit Suisse and Raymond James. ", "We will be reporting our fiscal third quarter results on January 27th. ", "And for a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit our Events Calendar on the Investor Relations website.", "Gwen, we are ready for our first question.", "Operator", "", "Your first question comes from John Difucci - J.P. Morgan.", "John Difucci - J.P. Morgan", "Just a question here on the Consumer. It was up 6%. We also saw Microsoft's results, saw some consumer strength both in Windows and in Xbox. And I just want to just get a gauge, I mean, you're through the beginning of this quarter anyway and, if this really has legs coming forward, how much of an impact do you think the new OS coming out is really going to have here? Has it carried over?", "And it does sound like the - I just want to, I guess, verify - that it does sound like the Enterprise business, anyway, may have stabilized here and at the same time, just judging from the deferred revenue changes relative to other years, people still, though, are buying for what they need today.", "Enrique Salem", "So, John, when you look at the Consumer business, I think our products are, again, the best products on the market. We've won over 150 awards for the 2009 products, and the 2010 products we believe are even better given the technology I mentioned that we code named Quorum, which brings in our reputation-based security technology, which is a big differentiator for us. As you know, the new threats are really the zero day attacks, and we think we've got the best solution for that type of attack. That same technology will also become available in our Enterprise products. ", "So the Consumer segment is doing well, I think, based on the strength of the products themselves, and I think the consumer buying behavior for us has continued to do well over the last several quarters, and I expect that to continue.", "I think on the Enterprise side you used the word that we've started to see stabilization. I think that's right. I also am pleased with the progress we're making with our new Endpoint security product in the SMB segment. So definitely some positive signs. But the environment still continues to have some folks who are concerned about their IT spending. But overall we're definitely seeing stabilization.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.", "Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch", "Just two quick questions for you. One, Enrique, maybe if you can give us an update on the OEM deals that you might have secured during the quarter. I think you provided the last update at the analyst day back in June. I was wondering if you had an update now.", "And also second, with NetBackup 6.6 and BackupExec 2.0 either launched or to be launched, between the two, how much of the forecast for the December quarter hinges upon any pent-up demand for these products or are you actually being conservative with your projection for the December quarter, not really including any material amount of business from these two backup products?", "Enrique Salem", "When we think about the OEM business, we continue to make sure that we're going to do deals that we feel are profitable and make business sense for us. I think the OEM deals that we did were more focused on the online backup business. The deals with Toshiba and Acer now gives us relationships with four of the top five OEMs, and we're definitely making some very progress there. ", "I think with regards to NetBackup 6.6 and BSR, the new BackupExec System Recovery, the BSR release is coming out now and so from an impact perspective on the quarter, it's minimal impact.", "Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch", "So I would be right in assuming that you've not assumed an [inaudible] amount of contribution from these two products in your forecast for the December quarter?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, we have not. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Enrique, on the storage side, I think you mentioned that the portion of the business that comes sold on the Sun platform is starting to show some signs of stabilization as well. If that's the case, what do you think is now kind of a normalized growth rate underpinning your storage business now that we're starting to get through that headwind of Sun? ", "Enrique Salem", "I think that the Sun platform, especially on the RISC side, the Sun RISC processor side, has continued to flatten out is the way I would put it. It's stabilized. I don't know that it's going to turn. I don't expect it to. My expectation is more about what are all the things we can do with our storage business on some of the other platforms and some of our new solutions, like FileStore, and getting on to other platforms like Windows and Linux. So I'm less focused on what's happening with the Sun platform and really looking at how do we move customers and how do we support customers on some of the other platforms.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "And maybe just a follow up because when I think of that business I think of it as kind of on one side the backup and recovery and the other side then the storage management, what we're kind of just talking about. How different is the growth rate between those two halves of the business? Because I feel like the storage foundation suite business has kind of in some ways depressed what may be fairly healthy on the other side.", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, I think when you look at the move that customers are making from tape-based backup to disc-based backup, there is a meaningful migration and that is absolutely helping the result in the NetBackup business. I think that you've got a modest to much flatter growth rate on the storage foundation side.", "Now some of the things that we are doing, Sarah, and you'll hear us talk more about this in the coming months is some of the capabilities that we're going to be delivering on the storage foundation Command Central Storage platform integrating some security capabilities. And I think the other thing that's important to note is that with the FileStore technology, I expect that will also help our results on the storage management side.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Just focusing back on the storage side, clearly you have several new products coming out over the next multiple quarters here. Is there any one in particular or a couple that stand out that you're sort of looking for to drive license growth?", "And then also just in terms of sales force productivity, Enrique, on the last call you mentioned some changes to the compensation structure. I'm wondering if you could comment on what results you're seeing from that and what future changes we might see.", "Enrique Salem", "Sure. I think when you look at what's going on in the storage area, our Stop Buying Storage campaign continues to resonate with customers as we help them get much better utilization of their existing storage. And so that bodes well for things like Command Central Storage and some of the other products that we have that help our customers understand storage utilization and how to make improvements. ", "When you look at the other products in the overall Storage segment, the NetBackup product I think is one that we're continuing to see demand from customers based on the migration from tape to disc-based backup and some of the new capabilities that we are going to be delivering.", "Now NetBackup, we're expecting that to be shipped in the March quarter and the real impact of that will be in fiscal year '11. ", "I think when you talk about the sales force and some of the changes we've made and we're continuing to look at, ultimately it really comes down to for me increasing what I would say specialization on areas where we see the biggest opportunities. And so we're continuing to do some of that work right now. We're seeing the first six months of results; we're analyzing it, and you should expect us to continue through this fiscal year to look at what are the benefits of specialization or further specialization on key product areas that we see good growth opportunities. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "If we dig into the Consumer for a minute, you guys are starting to expand your dual-brand strategy. You highlighted the retailer in Australia. What is the risk that you start to cannibalize price points around the Norton brand?", "And then secondly, if we look at kind of the OEM relationships from a protection perspective\u00a0- forget about backup - clearly you guys have a larger installed base, but why would the economics of an incremental OEM relationship be different for you versus your largest competitor?", "Enrique Salem", "Let me just take the first question and then we'll come back to the second one, Todd.", "If you look at the first question, we definitely have a couple of dynamics. The Norton brand has historically gone after a couple of segment in the market that is more the premium security buyer and PC Tools I think is going after a more price-sensitive buyer. ", "The good news, though, in the Australian retailer that I mentioned is that we were able to push competitors off the shelves basically, and so now what you've got is you've got PC Tools and Norton side by side where before they may have considered alternative products from competitors. And so I see that as a real positive for the dual-brand strategy and what we're able to do by basically gaining shelf space in some key markets.", "The second part of your question, Todd, if you could repeat it for me?", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yes. If I compare you guys to your largest competitor, I would think when you analyze an OEM transaction most of the revenue and cost associated with that is applied to new units going out the door. So I struggle with the fact that you guys, the sense I get is some of these OEM deals going on you guys just don't think are profitable, yet your largest competitor considers them very profitable. And I'm trying to understand what the different factors are that would influence that conclusion.", "Enrique Salem", "Well, I can speak to how we look at the deals. We look at the operating margin characteristics of our business, what the growth rate would be from any one transaction, and we also spend time thinking about the customer lifetime value. And what you can always do in a CLV calculation is you can extend the numbers of years that you expect a customer to stay with you. ", "And so we are always looking at our assumptions, but a lot of the analysis we do is based on that customer lifetime value. I don't like to look at these and extend out the lifetime that we expect a consumer to stay on a particular platform given just some of the dynamics that we've understood in the years we've been in this business. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "You mentioned some competitive wins in the Enterprise segment. As you look at some of the more significant wins, what products are you selling? Who are you displacing?", "Enrique Salem", "If you look at some of the bigger wins - I highlighted a couple in my comments; one was a big U.S. telecommunications company - that was a combination of our products where it was the strength of the portfolio. It was products like Control Compliance Suite, Endpoint Security, Managed Security Services, I mean, this was a very large deal where it absolutely was about the strength and breadth of our portfolio, where the CIO, his team presented him with an alternative point security product and he said we're not going to keep doing this, guys; we have to standardize on fewer vendors, standardize on a security partner, and they selected Symantec and went across four or five of our security products in that deal. So it was actually the combination that really clinched that.", "I think I highlighted deals with the City of Stockholm and others where it's your usual suspects. It's the companies that are in second place and down that we are getting these displacements from right now, and that's really driven by the focus that we have put on the Security business since the beginning of this fiscal year and we're starting to get some traction with displacements, quite frankly, against all of our competitors.", "James Beer", "Just one thing to add to that to build on the cross-selling point that Enrique was making. Obviously, we track our big deals in great detail, and it was interesting to see in this past quarter that for our $1 million and above deals, which we noted were up very nice sequentially, we had 20% of those deals now involving three of our business units on the Enterprise side. So a nice illustration that we're really selling across the portfolio.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "And then focusing on the cost side of the equation, there's been a lot of focus around sales and marketing, especially for the last six months, but if I look at that as a function of revenue, it actually ticked up sequentially 60 basis points. Is this new initiatives around sales specialists or why was there inefficiency in the quarter, especially given some of the revenue strength and the flat license performance?", "James Beer", "On the cost side of the equation, quarter-over-quarter the two things that drove the numbers there were foreign exchange and then OEM fees. So those were the drivers. ", "In terms of the Enterprise sales force, we continue to see improvements in efficiency there. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "My first question, I guess, is about the upcoming BackupExec release. In the prepared comments you talked about some of the incremental functions, in particular, de-duplication and archiving as being able to accelerate the cross-selling opportunity. Does that mean that you think you'll be able to charge for those separately so, if you are a customer on maintenance and you want those new features, you'll actually have to buy them separately? And how do you think about that cross-selling opportunity?", "Enrique Salem", "We definitely believe that there is an opportunity to charge for the new functionality separately. As you know, many of the things we do on the NetBackup platform are integrating new options and various agents, so we do think that there's an opportunity. ", "And I think if you look at our message of commoditizing the hardware or the infrastructure, I think that NetBackup 7.0 is going to help us do that because what you're going to get is the ability for us to much more efficiently utilize the existing hardware that you have plus also give you a lot of choice on what storage devices you use in conjunction with NetBackup. So I think this is going to be a release that will not only add the new functionality but accelerate our ability to drive costs out for our customers.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "And if I could ask a follow up on the margin side, James, I believe you said that you're going to incur $0.02 of costs related to the move to your internal ecommerce platform and $0.02 from OEM shipments ramping up. Would you expect to see the same kind of dilution in the fourth quarter?", "James Beer", "Well, on the OEM shipments it's hard to say because very much we're driven by the production volume forecasts of our various OEM partners. So that's a tough one to predict.", "And then in terms of the ecommerce platform, I would expect there to be a couple of cents of dilution in the March quarter for that.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "So I guess as we think out a little bit more medium term, a lot of folks, including us at Morgan Stanley, are expecting to see a relatively significant ramp in the PC market next year. How shall we think about the impact of a material acceleration in the PC market with respect to you maybe bearing some upfront costs around those shipments before you actually get activations on the back end?", "James Beer", "Well, that's exactly right. We take the operating expenditure upfront when our OEM partners are shipping the units out of their factories. And, of course, the benefit to us on the top line comes ratably over time, and that's after the customer has physically received the unit and then had the 60 or 90-day trial period. So there is quite a difference between when we recognize the revenue and when we incur the cost upfront.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Heather Bellini - ISI Group.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group", "I was wondering, Enrique, if you could just share with us a little bit about if we've seen the anniversarying now of the pressure on contract durations in the Enterprise side that you referred to in your June quarter results? ", "Enrique Salem", "I think we've got probably at least one more quarter. We've got to get through December, and it could be all the way through March to really anniversary it. So it could be as much as six months, Heather. ", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group", "Going forward would you expect that behavior, then, of the shortened contract durations, do you think that's here for good, that that's what we should expect when we're modeling going forward or do you think there's a chance that you could start to see those lengthen again next year?", "Enrique Salem", "I think when you look at the balance of fiscal '10 and then looking at fiscal '11, I would expect it to be very, very similar to what we're seeing right now. You may towards the end of fiscal year\u00a0'11 or beginning of fiscal year '12 start seeing an increase, but it's more dependent on the overall IT spending environment. So from a modeling perspective I'd say same for the balance of this year and fiscal year '11.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group", "On the expense front, James, you mentioned about the uptick in OEM shipments and that you're going to have the upfront costs associated with that. How much of a benefit did you get from that when PC shipments were coming in, and does that mean that you might not have as much room on the efficiency side going forward from a cost perspective as we've just seen over the last three or four quarters?", "James Beer", "Well, I think that certainly if PC unit shipments continue to grow then it'll be quite a headwind for us in terms of our various other cost reduction activities. Now of course they will continue. We're very much focused on building efficiency. ", "So as to have we seen some benefit from the slowing of PC shipments in the last year or so? Yes, there have been quarters where that has been the case. I wouldn't say, though, that that has been terribly dramatic in any one quarter. That's why we haven't been particularly calling it out.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities", "James, not to beat a dead horse here but just once again on the OEM placement fees and your expectation for Q3, just to clarify, what is the assumption for increased units versus any change to the placement fees themselves?", "James Beer", "No change to the placement fees themselves; it's just unit volumes.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities", "And reconciling the dilution with cash flow, what are the typical terms from the shipment to when the impact is actually paid to the OEM?", "James Beer", "Well, in terms of cash flow, you've got the period of time that it takes HP to get it out of the factory - that when we pay them and others - to the store itself, and so that could take a month, six weeks perhaps. And then there's a certain amount of time in the store. That's on the order maybe of a few weeks. And then there's the 60 or 90-day, depending upon the deal, trial period. And then it's at that point that the customer purchases the product and we receive the cash.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities", "Asia/Pac seemed to be a strong performance in the quarter. Can you comment on what drove that and any additional color?", "Enrique Salem", "If you think about our business, what we're definitely continuing to see is the growth in the Chinese market. I mean, I just remember a couple short years ago China was smaller than our business in Pacific - in Australia and New Zealand - and now China is rapidly approaching the size of Japan for us on the Enterprise side. So I think a lot of the health of the Asia/Pacific region has been China. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Enrique, I was wondering if you could just talk about what kind of growth you've seen in the pipeline. Obviously, large deals seem to be returning. As you're looking at those large deals and then taking into account the deal term, can you talk to us qualitatively or what you're seeing relative to your pipeline?", "Enrique Salem", "As we think about the business right now, the thing that I'm encouraged by is that we are continuing to have an opportunity to cross-sell our products into the customer base, and we are seeing more and more where customers are saying we're going to do business with less vendors. ", "And I think that bodes well for Symantec because ultimately, with the richness of our product portfolio and the integration work that we're doing, I've got a sense right now that the DLP product is strengthening our security business because that's having the effect of opening the conversations around what are the risks, what are the threats, and how do we not only sell DLP but then Control Compliance Suite and some of the other products in the Security portfolio, and also pulling in potentially products from the Storage side like Enterprise Vault. ", "So I think that's going to bode well for the numbers of deals and the size of the deals, and my expectation is, given that this is a fairly large renewal quarter, specifically on the traditional Storage side of the business, I think that'll be a positive for us as we go through the December quarter. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "You've been through the sales specialization for six months now. You've obviously seen some success with it. How long do you think it becomes meaningful where you see meaningful share gains or I should say maybe we on the outside start to see meaningful share gains with this sales strategy?", "Enrique Salem", "When you're working with a sales force of roughly 4,000 people you do look at how do you get the changes made, get everybody focused on the right product lines, and my sense is that you won't see the effect of the sales force change probably until fiscal year '11. I think it's something that right now we've been looking at districts in various parts of the U.S. and outside the U.S., and so it's going to be a bit more of we'll continue to analyze the benefits of it and the impact will probably be felt in fiscal year '11. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Back to the large deals - what's your win rate on those large deals and do you feel like it's increasing or decreasing?", "Enrique Salem", "Sorry?", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "On the large deals, the deals, say, over $1 million in particular, what do you think your win rate is and has that win rate improved or decreased, would you say?", "Enrique Salem", "It's absolutely improved. I think the notion here is that many of the deals when we get into the much larger deals that have many products, it really ends up being more we've been selected to be more of a strategic partner/vendor, and then it's a matter of what is the sum total of what the customer is going to be using in the one, two, three-year period. It's less about a point product competition. And that's what I think is the real strength of our portfolio at this point, that we are able to bring a range of products together in some of the larger deals. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "And then I think it was last quarter, Enrique, that you guided down the margin. You talked about doing more in house, and then we saw, you know, your relationship on the ecommerce side change. Are there any other opportunities you can share with us where you're making any sort of strategic changes like that?", "Enrique Salem", "Katherine, I'm thinking through. There are absolutely opportunities to continue to drive and manage our cost structure. I don't know of another item that we are currently contemplating of that scale. But on that particular item, that's obviously going well; our tests are going well, and we continue to see some improvements as we can now have direct control of the customer online experience and how we can test various options.", "But it's early. We've been doing this for less than a month - just a few weeks. But so far so good. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "How about the reverse side of that question, which is: Is there anything internally that you would consider selling off or outsourcing to improve the margins?", "James Beer", "Well, on the outsourcing side we actually have done quite a lot of work over the last year or two on both the IT side of the house and then the back office finance operation-type areas of the business. We're pleased with the financial returns that are coming out of that, but also in terms of the effectiveness of our ability to do our jobs. So that's really been the primary development going in the other direction.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Aaron Schwartz - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.", "Aaron Schwartz - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.", "I had a follow up question on the Consumer business. Understanding that PC Tools maybe expands your addressable market, can you talk at all about the consumer margin as that gains a larger mix shift? Is that going to put pressure on the Consumer margin or would you expect 360 and some other higher ASP products to continue to rise to offset that?", "Enrique Salem", "I think it is a relatively smaller part of the overall business, but it does have a lower margin than the premium-priced Norton products. ", "Now one of the benefits - and I just touched on it, Aaron - was the ecommerce side, where we will get some margin improvement in everything that we do online. And then the other opportunity is clearly to move folks from PC Tools through the range of the Norton products and try to get them up to Norton 360, and that's where we really would get the big payoff - if we can create a great experience for the customer and then upsell them all the way through the product line to 360. ", "Aaron Schwartz - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.", "Looking at the revenue guidance into the December quarter, what are your assumptions for year end spending on the Enterprise side? And given the deferred revenue outperformance, is there any reason that the sequential revenue shouldn't be greater? Is there something that pulled off here a little bit that you didn't expect?", "James Beer", "Well, we're expecting to see some level of budget flush at the end of December. But we are cognizant, of course, that IT budgets are down this year at our customers versus last year, so we wouldn't expect it to be as great a budget flush as we saw last December. ", "Aaron Schwartz - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.", "And on the deferred revenue?", "James Beer", "Sorry, what was the question around that?", "Aaron Schwartz - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.", "Just given the deferred revenue outperformance, is there any reason a sequential move in revenue shouldn't be a little greater in the December quarter? Did something not stabilize further than what you'd expected maybe 90 days ago?", "James Beer", "No, we were pleased by how the deferred revenue came through - very much relative of the strength of the maintenance revenues that we were recording. And the December quarter is obviously a big maintenance renewals quarter, so I would expect to see continued strength on the deferred side of it.", "As our Security business continues to develop and we believe take share over time, then of course that tends to be more ratable in its nature than does the Storage side of our business. So I think you can expect to see some sort of a shift in the mix, if you will, as a result. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brian Freed - Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Brian Freed - Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Real quick, as we look at the Server and Storage Management segment, over the last couple of years there's been some shifts in your pricing methodology. So as we try and correlate the growth in that to various trends such as storage capacity, the number of virtual machines, the number of physical servers, the number of processor cores, where do you see the highest correlation in terms of what drives positive or negative trends in that business?", "Enrique Salem", "I think when you look at the model, right now what we're trying to do is look at capacity-based pricing for some of our products given the rapid increase in storage and the rapid growth in storage. And so what you're seeing is us absolutely being able to move some customers there. We had a couple of very large deals we did this quarter that moved backup customers to a capacity-based model. ", "Ultimately, though, you definitely are seeing customers look for cost savings and how they drive more efficiency and basically reduce their cost of infrastructure. I think anything that allows us to help them do that, that is absolutely a positive from a quick benefit or ROI for the customer.", "Brian Freed - Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "So as you look at your deals, how far along do you think you are in terms of moving to more of a capacity-based pricing model?", "Enrique Salem", "It's early. I think it's very early. I think that we've introduced it. We're definitely seeing big deals happen on a capacity model. But we're just at the beginning of that.", "Helyn Corcos", "Gwen, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Can you just talk about the Federal business? There's a lot of talk about cybersecurity spending. It's a big initiative with the government. It obviously came in strong. Just talk about that in the quarter but, more importantly, just going forward how you guys are viewing that and just are you able to get that opportunity?", "Enrique Salem", "I think this quarter we saw double-digit growth in the Federal business as it's their fiscal year end. We definitely see opportunity with some of the new initiatives. We've had a number of discussions with the leadership teams across the various agencies, both civilian and non-civilian, and there's a range of things that they're trying to do specifically in the security category where we see a lot of opportunity. I expect that to be something that will develop over the balance of this fiscal year and into fiscal year '11.", "Operator", "", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Enrique Salem for any closing remarks.", "Enrique Salem", "Well, in conclusion, we're pleased with our execution during the September quarter. In particular, we're pleased with the strength in the Consumer segment and with the initial progress we're seeing in the SMB Security market.", "That concludes today's call, and I'd like to say thank you to everybody for joining us.

He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relation\u2019s website at Symantec.com/invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are also posted on our website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that we will review our non-GAAP financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated in the prepared remarks.", "Sequential growth rates are based on as reported basis. For the December 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.48 per Euro and the end of period rate was $1.43 per Euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.47 per Euro.", "For the December 08 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.32 per Euro and the end of period rate was $1.39 per Euro. We\u2019ve included a summary and reconciliation of the year-over-year growth rate in our press release tables and in our supplemental information provided on the website.

Our focus on a few priorities enable us to achieve better than expected results.", "We also benefited from a stabilizing economy and a moderate IT budget flush.", "The continued strength of our consumer business along with our sales and product initiatives and our Enterprise security and compliance portfolio drove the strength of our results of this quarter.", "Looking across the geographies, Europe generated strong bookings. The Americas saw continued demand in the government sector and Asia was driven by strength in China and Australia.", "We also saw a rebound from customers in the financial services vertical worldwide.", "Sales activity continue to improve as the sales force effectively utilized the broader Symantec portfolio to take advantage of up-sell and cross-sell opportunities.", "During the quarter, 39% of our deals over a million dollars included sales from both our security and storage segments.", "Our focused sales initiatives implemented over the last few quarters are starting to have a positive impact on our execution. Numerous competitive deals with companies in various industries and countries around the world.", "Our security compliance business benefited from selling solutions rather than just point products. Data loss prevention and compliance solutions posted double digit bookings growth this quarter.", "Barkley\u2019s, a global leader in banking and asset management, signed a multi-year contract spanning our product portfolio. The deal allows Barkley\u2019s to reduce cost by decreasing their vendor count, standardizing technology across multiple business lines, simplifying complex IT processes and taking advantage of both our on-premise and hosted solutions.", "This is one of the many examples which illustrates that hosted services is an opportunity for us across Enterprises of all sizes.", "In addition, we expand our security partnership with another global financial institution to include our data loss prevention, compliance, and end point security sweeps.", "Our focus on various mid-market product and channel initiatives is also beginning to produce encouraging results.", "We are receiving positive product feedback and higher net promoter scores from our customers and partners positioning us well for the future.", "A recent CRN review praised a latest release of Symantec end point protection for being well tailored to small business customers.", "Partners, including Ingram Micro, Tech Data, CDW, and Insight recognized us for delivering programs and resources that are helping them to grow their businesses.", "Our consumer business maintained its momentum.

Our reputation based mal ware detection technology will be included in our 2010 Norton 360 products, which will ship in the March quarter.", "The strength of our consumer products gives us a competitive advantage with partners of our customer channels, including OEM, ISP, online, and retail. This quarter we had several ISP wins, including a competitive displacement of Comcast to pride Security for its 15 million high speed internet customers.", "We also benefit from strategic marketing initiatives and from the opportunity to cross-sell consumer services. This multi-year deal was driven by the quality of our products as well as our ability to leverage our Enterprise relationship with Comcast in their data centers.", "We also signed a deal with Quest, another top global ISP, to offer security products to their high speed internet customers. This expands an existing agreement in which Quest offers its high speed internet customers automatic online backup.", "Furthermore, in Europe, we renewed a multi-year agreement to provide security to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s T-home customers.", "Additionally, our Norton security scan solution will be available as a download through full partnerships this quarter.", "In Asia, we continue to have partnerships with multiple motherboard manufacturers and expanded our relationship with MSI to include Norton internet security and Norton online backup.", "We also won an agreement with Positivo, the largest OEM in Brazil.", "In the retail channel, we further expanded our relationship with Staples.", "We have seamlessly rolled out new e-commerce stores in all major markets around the world.

We are on track to complete the transition on schedule.", "Now moving to our cloud and saas-based offerings. We are pleased with the record bookings performance by the Symantec hosted services team this quarter. The strong results were driven by leveraging Symantec go-to-market network, which generated more than 75 deals during the quarter.", "Our hosted services business now works with 1,800 partners. Additionally, we won multiple deals over a million dollars. This is indicative of what we\u2019re starting to see with large Enterprises adopting hosted solutions.", "Also during the quarter, we acquired Softscan, the privately held saas security leader in the Nordic region. This industry consolidating deal extends our saas security leadership", "For the healthcare vertical, we launched a saas solution addressing hospitals\u2019 growing need for storing medical images. We\u2019ll also allow secure access to these images for affiliated and non-affiliated providers over the internet.", "Other cloud initiatives including consumer online backup, now host over 45 petabytes of data for more than 11 million customers.", "Our new cloud storage platform that supports saas services built on the Symatec FileStore architecture.

This approach is more efficient and reduces cost for our customers.", "We expect these releases will benefit our cross-selling capabilities during the next fiscal year as we educate our customers and the channel on the benefits of these products.", "During the quarter, we saw strong year-over-year revenue growth for Enterprise vault. Customers are using Enterprise vault to improve storage optimization by de-duplicating email and file server data. This reduces the backup size and in addition we are able to house long-term archives on cheaper storage tiers.", "In conclusion, the December quarter illustrates the ongoing progress that we\u2019re making. The sales team is diligently executing the productivity initiatives put into place earlier in the year and I\u2019m especially pleased with the focus we have on selling our security and backup solutions to Enterprise and consumer customers.", "We will continue to deliver product integration across the portfolio and have a healthy pipeline of new product releases, which we will be discussing with our customers in more detail at our user conference in April.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to James to provide you the financial results for the quarter.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone.", "I am pleased to report that Symantec achieved better than expected third quarter results in each of our key financial metrics, both on an as reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency.", "During the quarter, the US dollar weakened 12% against the Euro versus the year ago period, increasing our international revenue as measured in US dollars.", "Foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue by $63 million or by 4% points year-over-year.", "Currency effects had no impact on revenue as compared to the guidance we provided on October 28.", "Revenue for the third quarter was $1.55 billion dollars, a decline of 3% from the year ago period and increase of 5% sequentially.", "Net income was $326 million, resulting in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40 for the December 2009 period.", "We are encouraged by the improvements in our license revenue and by the sequential stabilization of our maintenance revenues. In particular, we saw strong performance from our government verticals.", "We are pleased with the favorable ruling we received from the US tax court regarding the tax assessment for 2000 and 2001. After evaluating the December ruling, we concluded that our previous accrual related to this matter exceeded our revised estimated incremental tax liability. As a result, we realized a one-time benefit to get net income of $78.5 million, equivalent to $0.10 of benefit to earnings per share.", "On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded a one-time benefit to net income of $16.5 million, equivalent to $0.02 of earnings per share benefit.", "The non-GAAP benefit is due to the reversal of accrued interest on the original tax assessment, which we\u2019ve been recording since the Veritas acquisition. As a result of the judges ruling, we do not expect to make any additional cash payments related.", "Now I\u2019ll review the financial details of the December quarter. By geography, our international revenue of $793 million represented 51% of the total and decreased 5% the year ago period. The Asia/Pacific/Japan region grew 5%, while the Americas declined 2%, and the Europe/Middle East/Africa region declined by 9%.", "Now, moving onto revenue by segment.

We generated 108 transactions worth more than $1 million, up 4% year-over-year and up 54% sequentially. All of our deals value up more than $300,000, 73% included more than one of our products.", "Our Security and Compliance Group generated revenue of $372 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year and an increase of 7% sequentially.", "We are pleased both with our security deal win rate and with the improvement we saw in cross-selling our various security products. In fact, eight of our top ten deals included multiple security offerings with D(?) prevention posting double digit year-over-year growth.", "The store and serve management group generated revenue of $594 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year and an increase of $0.6 sequentially.", "This year, our performance was driven by the continuation of the near term focused customer buying behavior that we have experienced during the last two quarters. In addition, the server market deceleration continue to put pressure on the storage business, particularly related to new license sales on the sun platform.", "Our Services business generated revenue of $107 million, down 5% year-over-year, but up 4% sequentially.", "Turning now to margins, gross margin was 86.5% for the December 2009 quarter, in line with the comparable year ago period.", "Our operating margin of 28.3% was down 390 basis points year-over-year due to the higher OEM placement fees and the launch of our new e-commerce platform.", "We expect to see the corresponding benefits of these investments during the next 12 to 24 months.", "Now moving onto the balance sheet, we exited the December quarter with a cash position of approximately $2.6 billion.", "Cash flow from operating activities generated $393 million in the December quarter.

Just hoping to ask a quick question about the EPS headwind due to an improving PC shipment environment. Should we think about it for the March quarter in the same framework that you provided for the December quarter?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, that\u2019s right. We talked in December about $0.02 cents worth of dilution from OEM fees. Came in a little ahead of that, but I would offer the same guidance for the March quarter.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to John Difucci - J.P. Morgan.", "John Difucci - J.P. Morgan", "James, other than the consumer headwind, is there anything else, especially given it looks like the corporate security business was stronger than at least we had modeled. Just curious, is there any other timing of expense versus revenue actually hitting operating expenses a little higher than expected, especially that sales and marketing line.", "James Beer", "Really, the OEM fee issue is the driver here. The other thing I would point to of course is the new consumer e-commerce platform. While we\u2019re very pleased with its performance and so forth, that also is dilutive to the PNL in the near term.", "John Difucci - J.P. Morgan", "Enrique, on the storage business, that continues to be I guess a little bit better than it was, but still continues to be somewhat weak. I\u2019m just curious, is there any reason that we should anticipate that the new versions of the backup products would cause some purchase delays here. How much of that business is impacted by what\u2019s been going on at Sun and could that sort of soften going forward?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at server sales, that is something directly tied to what we see in the storage and server business and I do think as you get clarity around the Sun Oracle merger, I think that will help to stabilize the Solaris platform. So that combination should provide stabilization.", "Now the two new releases, Net Backup 7 and BE 2010, our expectation is the new Puredisk capability should be something that will get quick adoption based on the need for de-duplication reducing the amount of storage that people have to manage. I do expect BE 2010, given that the new capabilities to get a lot of folks to move forward with that upgrade process. So Puredisk and BE 2010 should do very well for us and then over the long term, my expectation is we\u2019ll start seeing the migration from the Net Backup 6 platform to 7, but I do expect a stabilizing storage business for us, given the server sales and the new releases.", "John Difucci - J.P. Morgan", "In the storage business, have people sort of hesitated in anticipation of these new products coming out or do you think business just sort of is what it is and you hope to see an uptick with these new products?", "Enrique Salem", "I think on the BE platform, you will get folks waiting for the new version, as soon as we do our channel notifications, because you know a lot of that product goes through our channel partners and so given the upcoming relief, there\u2019s always a little bit of a slowdown or lag in the sale of a new product.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Firstly, I was wondering if you see any difference in SMB and enterprise level across geographies?", "James Beer", "I think it\u2019s similar around the world. I would tell you as we look at the global landscape, there\u2019s definitely been similar characteristics. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region maybe a little bit weaker, but in general very similar the world.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Enterprise level as well?", "James Beer", "Similar characteristics. What I would say what we saw is China and Australia I think are the stronger geographies. We definitely saw financial services improvements. I think that the public sector in the US and Americas did well in the government sector.", "Sarah Friar \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "How does the upcoming Backup product improve the company competitively and elaborate on new features and what do you expect the product cycle to be?", "James Beer", "A couple of things that are important to our customers is we want them to not think about backup and archiving separately. We want them to look at that as one integrated capability. So instead of having to perform a backup on let\u2019s say an exchange server and then do a separate archive, what we\u2019ve done is to optimize the process and we\u2019re uniquely positioned to do this. What you\u2019re able to do is basically archive off of the backup data set. That makes the utilization of the exchange server much more efficient and so that example of bringing together archiving and backup is an important thing that we\u2019ve been talking about, because it simplifies deployment, better utilizes the recourses.", "The new capabilities and the integration of the market leading archiving technology starts to provide greater differentiation for both of those market leading products.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "On the last conference call, you mentioned a program in a couple regions looking at specialization of the sales force between security and storage. I was wondering if you could give us an update how that\u2019s going.", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re always going to keep evaluating looking for potential improvements and I think as we look at the selling process, we\u2019ll make minor refinements, but at this point I don\u2019t plan to make any big changes to the sales structure as we go into fiscal year.", "During the December quarter, you saw great performance utilizing the current structure and I\u2019m very happy with those results. So I think at this point it\u2019s going to be to continue to look at what refinements we can make, but don\u2019t expect any big changes as we go into fiscal year 2011.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Interest and other income has been moving around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, what would your expectation be for the March quarter?", "James Beer", "My expectation will be modestly improved. We\u2019re going through an accounting process change with joint venture. That\u2019ll drive about $1.5 million dollars worth of benefit into the March quarter.", "Aside from that, I would expect a continuation of what we\u2019d seen in recent quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch.", "Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch", "The sizes of the Enterprise deal, it\u2019s been growing well. Seasonality?", "Enrique Salem", "What you want to look at is one of the stats I called out in my comments is we\u2019re starting to see better cross-selling of the portfolio. 39% of the deals above a million dollars had products from both our security segment and our storage segment. That\u2019s what I think is starting to drive some of the success in the large enterprise or in the larger deals.", "We\u2019ve been talking about for the last year further integration of our technologies. When you look at what we\u2019re doing with products like Net Backup and archiving, that\u2019s just an example. You\u2019ll be hearing more from us at our user conference about how we\u2019re leveraging our DLP technology more broadly. So it\u2019s really about integration, enabling us to cross-sell across the entire portfolio.", "The other thing is the ability to work across the consumer business and the Enterprise business. If you look at the Comcast deal, our great relationships with Comcast and the data center enabled them to have a very favorable view toward Symantec that was very supportive of the work we did on the consumer side. And so, when you look at what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re starting to get leverage across the portfolio and also across business segments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities", "Enrique, in the consumer business, in years past it was Symantec\u2019s goal to grow the consumer business at or better than the overall market rate and obviously there\u2019s been a lot of unforeseen disruptions since then, but at this point, given you have greater visibility to consumer bookings than we do, can you give us any sense of how you believe you\u2019re performing relative to the market and what you expect the trend will be going forward? Also, any updates on your relationship with HP?", "Enrique Salem", "What we\u2019re seeing is that across the channels, the Comcast deal, the Quest extension, the Positivo deal, we\u2019re starting to get a lot of performance across all of the various channels and what\u2019s differentiating us is we\u2019re incredibly pleased with how well the products are doing.", "Winning 50 awards in four months, that\u2019s almost becoming to us like second nature. That\u2019s unheard. We win every award now with our consumer products. And so, from our perspective, the ability to have the best products on the market is allowing us to go across the channels. And so, as James has mentioned, one of the places that you are going to see benefit is while the OEM fees have gone up and there is a lag between when the OEM goes up and the bookings come in and the radible revenue materializes, so there\u2019s definitely a lag there, but we are encouraged by the cross channel and some of the things we\u2019re seeing given the product capabilities.", "Now, to the HP deal, I don\u2019t have anything new to report. Clearly, we\u2019re always looking at all of the different OEM deals. We stand by what we always said \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do deals that don\u2019t make economic sense for Symantec. We\u2019re not dependent upon any one partner. I mean we\u2019ve got such a broad distribution capability. HP, quite frankly, is just another OEM.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research Equities", "James, how would you characterize your assumptions for guidance? I know in the prepared remarks you spoke about customers continuing to purchase just for their current needs, but if you can characterize guidance relative to the past couple of quarters.", "James Beer", "We\u2019re not expecting there to be any significant uptick in the IT budgets for our customers. We\u2019re looking for some modest improvement of 2009, which was obviously a particularly weak year for IT spending. So I would say our guidance is consistent with that theme of modest improvement.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Enrique, could you expand a little bit on your consumer backup. I think you mentioned 11 million customers. Are those all paying customers or some of those trial and what\u2019s the paying total right now?", "Enrique Salem", "The way you want to look at is the biggest driver of the 11 million is what\u2019s in Norton 360. It\u2019s the biggest component. That basically brings and improves the ability to renew Norton 360. What we get is an improvement in renewal rates. We have four of the top five OEMs are using the online backup as a part of their offering. So some of those units are trial that over a period of time we look to convert to paying customers. Backup is doing two things. One, because we can operate unique capability, landing lots of OEMs and ISPs. Two, it definitely improves the retention rate on Norton 360.", "James Beer", "We\u2019re very pleased with that product and the price premium it affords us over Norton internet security.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "In your prepared remarks, you called out both government and energy as strong verticals. Can you expand on that? This being the federal government\u2019s first fiscal quarter, what did you see there? Better than expected?", "Enrique Salem", "You definitely are benefiting from the focus on cyber security and the range of threats that are out there, I think the federal government is absolutely, given the President\u2019s comments in May about the importance of protecting the critical infrastructure of the US and his view that we were under attack, I think that\u2019s putting a lot of emphasis in the public sector on this notion of cyber security.", "The second point is given the concern about insider or external threats, there\u2019s definitely a focus on information assurance or protecting information and so that combination of how do you protect critical information, how do you protect against cyber threats, I think voted very well for our public sector business.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Brent Phil \u2013 UBS", "Reed in for Brent Phil \u2013 UBS", "James, I was wondering if you could give us a sense where you see further efficiencies in your cost structure to offset the higher OEM placement fees.", "James Beer", "I think there are opportunities for us across our organization to continue to focus on our cost structure. That\u2019s very much our message internally. So we very much will maintain that focus and momentum during the coming year.", "So no change in perspective there and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re running out of ideas at all. We have plenty of things to work on. That said, clearly the OEM fees, because of this timing dislocation between when we pay the OEMs and when we actually receive a ratable revenue is going to be putting pressure on the operating margins, no question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "On the consumer side, can you guys give us a sense how should we think about the economic model and is the revenue opportunity per customer equivalent to the OEM or traditional retail model?", "Enrique Salem", "Each channel has a different set of economics. I think you want to think about the customer lifetime value and our opportunity to bring on a customer in any part of our portfolio and then cross-sell them through Norton internet security all the way to Norton 360. Each channel has different economics. What we focus on though is what\u2019s the total value of that customer for a multi-year period.", "So while maybe a little more expensive in one channel than the other, our goal and we look at it by channel, by partner, what is the CLB.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So if I step back and look at the consumer business more from a holistic perspective, if I look at OEM preload, which I think is viewed as the most natural way to capture a customer, are you seeing OEM preload as a percentage of the consumer business?", "Enrique Salem", "It\u2019s actually flattening out. We\u2019re seeing some of the alternative channels, for example, some of the work we\u2019re doing with PC tools, which is more of an online lower price point product as a changing dynamic. So I definitely would tell you OEM has flattened out, given that the top ten OEMs total share is not growing in any significant way. And so that percentage of customer acquisition in OEM is flattened now.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I want to understand the Sun situation a little bit better. Should we be thinking about the Sun relationship just going away and going to zero? I mean any sense what Oracle\u2019s doing to do on the storage side?", "Enrique Salem", "I think when you look at it, it\u2019s still a little bit too early to say what Oracle will ultimately do, but you\u2019re definitely seeing the spark platform has been slowing for some time and I think the uncertainty of the transaction I think accelerated what was happening on the spark platform. I expect that there\u2019ll be a continuing relationship with Oracle on the various Sun products. The maintenance steams generate very healthy and positive cash flow for us and expect that to definitely continue.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Should we think about on the storage side, (?) impact of, your Q1/Q2 starting to see that business accelerate, is it meaningful enough that we should start seeing an uptick?", "Enrique Salem", "I would tell you it flattens. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019d see a different projectory only because, again, it just depends what\u2019s happening with how big and how many new units are shipped and you also have the maintenance base, which is fairly substantial.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "My question is on the Alteris products. Can you talk about how the upcoming Windows 7 cycle might be catalyst and how you expect that to play out?", "Enrique Salem", "Our expectation is if businesses start migrating to Windows 7, because we haven\u2019t seen yet a big move yet to Windows 7. We definitely are seeing a lot folks tested in the Enterprise space, but given the Symantec and the Alteris products have been the main way, the primary way that customers have migrated, definitely expect that to be a benefit, but we won\u2019t see that until probably some point in our fiscal year 11 and my best estimation would be that post the summer months, back half of the fiscal year, is when you\u2019re going to start probably seeing some of the benefit in that migration.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Can you give us some more color on the Comcast and the Quest deals?", "Enrique Salem", "With Quest, it started with our strength in the online backup business that have allowed us to expand in the security products and with Comcast, they clearly saw the great performance of our products, the quality of the products, plus the relationship they were enjoying with us in the data center that drove our ability to expand into being the provider for the 15 million internet users at Comcast.", "As far as the go forward model for us, what we\u2019re very focused on is given the strength of our products, we want to get more units into the marketplace and so we are absolutely working across all of the different channels to get as many of the 2010 products into the marketplace.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Are these two deals fully expenses now? Meaning do you only have the revenue share portion left?", "James Beer", "In terms of Comcast and Quest? Just getting started with these deals. Comcast is not a placement fee type arrangement. That\u2019s an arrangement where we get paid a royalty based on the number of customers that take up our products.", "So it\u2019s a different accounting structure to the placement fee structure.", "Quest is a backup offering. So we have not done the placement fee arrangements with our online backup OEM partners. So those are more so on a revenue sharing arrangement.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Freed - Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Brian Freed - Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.", "If you look at the joint venture, can you talk a little bit about the size of that joint venture at this time and the growth rate as well as where you see the impact of the bottom line trending?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at what we\u2019re doing in the joint venture, it\u2019s definitely something where the company Huawei, HS, has commented on a bookings model that represents about $300 million in bookings. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re accounting for it, as James described in the other income line, and so we\u2019re continuing to track that and it\u2019s stayed pretty constant. I don\u2019t expect that to go up or down. Now what we\u2019re pleased by is the notion that the product portfolio is getting very strong. I mean everything from network attached storage devices to solid state technology, security appliances. I think it\u2019s a nice complement to what we\u2019ve been doing in the software service or host business and software business.", "So we\u2019re pleased with where we are with the joint venture. Obviously we continue to track that very carefully and we\u2019re comfortable with the investment level that we\u2019re currently making.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Enrique, what surprised you in the quarter in terms of just customer buying behaviors?", "Enrique Salem", "I think the one comment I would make is financial services. I think global financial services, globally financial services companies came back a little stronger than I would have expected. That would be the one comment I would make. Everything else tracked pretty much as I would have expected.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Can you give us an update with what\u2019s going on with the SPS/SMB product that shipped in May?", "Enrique Salem", "We definitely are seeing the bookings improvement. The comments we\u2019re getting from customers and partners are very positive. The technology is definitely suited for that segment, which is one of the things that we want to address with the product. Now our partner loyalty scores are going up as a result of the capabilities of the product. So overall, we are starting to see a benefit and I think we\u2019re seeing it in the bookings benefit. You\u2019re starting to see a little bit of the benefit on the as reported revenue and that\u2019s part of the reason for the improvements in the security and compliance segment.", "James Beer", "I was quite pleased with the sequential bookings performance.", "Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Just turning to the consumer business, the backup part of it. I understand that you are now at four of the top five OEMs and maybe HP was maybe the first one. Are you seeing that contribute to new bookings in the consumer business and have you started to market that to the install base?", "Enrique Salem", "It\u2019s still a very small part of the overall consumer business on a standalone basis. As far as how we market the product, we see backup as a way of acquiring new customers and then upselling them in two directions. One, selling them more storage. Two, trying to cross-sell them to our suite products, whether it be Norton internet security or Norton 360.", "Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Lastly, obviously a lot of talk in the news about these Chinese attacks on 34 US companies. What might that mean to Symantec and what kind of products might benefit from those kinds of things going on, if any?", "Enrique Salem", "First and foremost, it really reinforces the messages that we\u2019ve been talking about to our customers, where attacks are going to become very, very targeted. The bad guys, whoever they are, are going to figure out that it\u2019s much more effective and efficient to go after specific individuals or businesses. That\u2019s what we have been saying and that\u2019s what you saw in this attack. I expect that to continue to increase and more than anything what it\u2019s done is it\u2019s raised awareness for some of these cyber threats and these targeted attacks.", "From our product portfolio perspective, range of our technologies would absolutely detect that threat today. Some of our new technologies, our reputation-based technologies, our intrusion prevention technologies, so there\u2019s a whole range of things that could be utilized to detect the threat.", "The second part of it is \u2013 what are people targeting ultimately is information. Whether that information is intellectual property in the form of source code, customer data, credit card data, we can absolutely use our data loss prevention products to better monitor and make sure that these types of threats and attacks don\u2019t or aren\u2019t capable of stealing propriety or confidential information.", "So it\u2019s really both on the direct protection, mal ware detection, and other capabilities like that and then also on protecting the information with our market leading DLP products.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Tim Cossel \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Tim Cossel \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "First on the e-commerce platform, how is the progress going there? Can you give us any idea of when that turns into being a tailwind rather than a headwind on margins?", "Enrique Salem", "We\u2019re very pleased with where we are. I mean we\u2019ve been rolling out new stores around the world very efficiently. We monitor it. We\u2019ve got a very clear set of metrics that allow us to see how they perform. And so we\u2019re pleased with where we are. It\u2019s definitely on track. Some of the big benefits that I\u2019m most pleased with is our ability to react more quickly to changes that we want to make. The ability to gather information that allows us to better target customers to specific products. And so my sense is a couple of comments. One, we\u2019re on track, and second, it\u2019s absolutely going to have a positive effect over time on our ability to retain and upsell customers.", "James Beer", "I would expect it to be this coming December quarter that would be the first quarter in which the platform will be accretive.", "Tim Cossel \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "With Oracle Sun and of course Cisco and EMC and several of the others out there trying to sell the complete stack, they\u2019re also advertising storage management capabilities. How do you think that affects your business?", "Enrique Salem", "What you want to do is \u2013 why do people go to the Symantec? What they\u2019re trying to do is make sure they don\u2019t get locked into a vertical stat or into one vendor and quite frankly, all of these situations, they absolutely do not have an impact on our ability to sell our backup products.", "We\u2019re seeing, given the new backup features, we definitely are seeing strengthening of the opportunity and a lot of demand for those products. So while we definitely see these, those stacks are trying to lock you in. They\u2019re trying to basically say you have to use our approach and most large companies understand the importance of having some amount of flexibility and because we offer them that choice, we can help them to commoditize some of the underlying hardware, we\u2019re definitely seeing people move to using our storage management products.", "Helyn Corcos", "Gwen, looks like we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our last question from Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Enrique, if you just pull back and look at consumer business overall, wondering if you can kind of just summarize for us what you\u2019re seeing. Is it really what\u2019s driving the business is the PC tools sub-segment of market strategy, the OEM relationships, the online backup. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of different moving parts to the strategy. If you could summarize it for us, that\u2019d be helpful.", "Enrique Salem", "I\u2019d summarize it this way. One, we\u2019ve got the very best products on the market and in a tech company it starts with products. Two, I think we\u2019ve taken a multi brand approach where it allows us to basically use different products or different brands in different segments and we did see PC tools showing double digit growth. So that\u2019s just saying that pretty clearly our ability to serve customers across the ranges of price points is important.", "Then lastly, we\u2019re not depending on any one channel. I mean we go OEM. We go online. We go through retail and we\u2019ve got strength in all of those different channels. So I would tell you it\u2019s a combination of great products, having a dual brand strategy, and being able to leverage the breadth of our distribution in channels.", "So those three things are what are really making the difference to our consumer business.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Enrique Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique Salem", "Thank you, everyone, for participating on our call this afternoon. I\u2019m very proud of our team and the results that they delivered in the December quarter.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss fiscal second quarter 2011 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during this quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our site, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the site shortly after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. For September 2010, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.30 per euro, and the end of period rate was $1.38 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.26 per euro. For the September 2009 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro and the end of period rate was $1.46 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information.", "Some of the information discussed on this call including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website.", "And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique Salem", "Thanks, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. The team's solid execution during the September quarter resulted in better-than-expected results. Our performance was driven by strength in backup and archiving and continued growth in hosted services and Data Loss Prevention. We closed a majority of the enterprise deals that had slipped last quarter and finished the September quarter on a strong note. In addition, I'm pleased with the better-than-expected results for PGP, GuardianEdge and the VeriSign Security business.", "Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Our Consumer business benefited from the strength of our eCommerce platform and our market-leading products, Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. Our new eCommerce platform completed its first anniversary of operations and now serves 230 countries in 18 languages and supports 24 currencies. Our ability to develop more targeted programs is benefiting renewals, as well as our upselling and cross-selling efforts.", "According to Internet Retailer, Symantec ranked number one in software online sales and is one of the top five consumer brands. Last month, we successfully launched the 2011 version of Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus, which further improve consumers' online safety without sacrificing performance. Consumers benefit from our innovative technologies such as reputation-based security, which harnesses results from over 100 million systems in over 200 countries to expose threats other security vendors miss. Features like Safe Web, Proactive PC Performance Alerts and integration with Norton Online Family further differentiate Norton from the competition.", "According to independent research from PassMark, AV-Test, AV Comparatives and DennisLabs, Norton Internet Security has ranked number one in online threat detection and number one in overall performance. In addition, PC Magazine awarded Norton Internet Security its Editor's Choice Award for the fourth consecutive year and Norton AntiVirus, its Editors Choice Award, for the first time since 2006.", "Over the past two quarters, the growth rate of the Consumer revenue has declined as PC units have shifted towards low-end devices, which have lower conversion rates. Having said that, we expect growth rates to stabilize as we benefit from growth in overall PC unit shipments in our ongoing efforts to drive higher conversion rates. As part of these efforts, we are continuing to enhance the trial experience by improving the design and messaging of trial activation reminders. We're also working with our partners to further integrate the trial and purchase experience into the initial PC set-up.", "We are in focused on acquiring new customers through our multi-channel distribution network. I'd like to highlight a few of our September quarter wins. We expanded our retail relationships with Costco, Best Buy and Boulanger, a French retailer, during the quarter. In addition, we won several ISP deals with partners such as United Online and Telmex. We also renewed our OEM relationship with Sony to ship Norton Internet Security in the Americas. We continue to build on the Norton value proposition through sales of our Norton Online Backup, which ships on six of the top 10 OEMs.", "In addition, we are reaching millions of consumers through free offerings such as Norton Online Family, Norton Security Scan and Norton PC Checkup. Through these services, we are upselling our Norton Security, Backup and remote service offerings.", "Beyond the PC, we are positioned to take advantage of protecting consumers through our Norton Everywhere initiative. Norton Everywhere extends trust to new devices and consumer applications spanning across mobile, smart devices and embedded services. The June beta release of Norton Mobile Security and Norton DNS have received positive response with over 300,000 users to date. Partner interest around the globe for these offerings has also been encouraging. You can expect us to leverage our technologies and collaborate with industry leaders to take advantage of Internet-connected devices beyond the PC.", "Now, I'd like to turn my attention to our Enterprise business. As the fiscal year for the U.S. federal government came to a close, we posted double-digit, public-sector bookings growth, driven by strength across all product lines in both the civilian and defense agencies. Our commitment to government standards across the portfolio, along with products such as DLP and Enterprise Vault, helped drive our performance. With increased revelatory requirements, our recent acquisition of GuardianEdge has also resonated well in the public sector.", "Storage Management performed in line with our expectations. Our Storage Foundation and Cluster Server Products helped organizations capitalize on advanced storage technologies such as thin provisioning and solid state drives, while continuing to reduce costs and get better ROI from their hardware infrastructure. For example, Symantec's Storage Management products helped Vodafone decrease their annual hardware and ongoing maintenance costs and realize a three- to four-fold reduction in the company's Microsoft Exchange data store.  Our value proposition continues to remain strong given our software's ability to work in heterogeneous environments.", "Over the last few quarters, a decline in OEM revenues from Sun-Oracle has put pressure on this part of the business. But having said that, we are committed to selling our products on all platforms, as well as focusing on long-term growth opportunities such as virtualization, private clouds and storage optimization.", "Our Storage business remains important as we further integrate our security and storage technologies to create unique offerings such as Data Insight, which helps customers manage growth in unstructured data in ways that our competitors cannot match. We remain focused on strengthening our relationships and product footprint in our top accounts.", "Some of our new storage management initiatives are centered around helping customers virtualize applications and databases. Earlier this quarter, we launched the Application High Availability, also known as AppHA and VirtualStore, which are jointly developed with VMware. AppHA helps organizations virtualize their business-critical applications with confidence, and VirtualStore provides high-performance, low-cost storage for desktop and server virtualization deployments. These new products, along with our recently launched FileStore and Data Insight offerings represent long-term growth opportunities for our Storage business.", "Now moving on to our Backup and Archiving business. NetBackup, the number one backup solution for the enterprise posted mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by strong demand for deduplication and virtual machine protection. Through integrated deduplication, we help customers control information growth, eliminating redundant data at the source and optimize storage resources more efficiently than first-generation deduplication solutions.", "NetBackup, won the Best of VMWorld 2010 Gold Award in the Business Continuity and Data Protection category for its market-leading and unique virtual machine protection capabilities. Additionally, we started shipping NetBackup deduplication appliances, and the response from customers has been very positive. As information continues to grow at unprecedented rates, our capacity-based pricing model positions us to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing strong customer adoption of this new model as over 23% of licensed bookings for the NetBackup were on the capacity-based model. We will update you on customer adoption of this new pricing model once a year.", "In the mid-market, Backup Exec generated second consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Our customers and partners benefit from an unmatched comprehensive solution that simplifies data management through integrated deduplication, archiving and virtual machine protection. Backup Exec now protects more than 40,000 VMware hosts and an estimated 1 million VMware guests. Business Solutions magazine named Backup Exec the best channel product for 2010 due to its ease of installation, richness of features and reliability.", "Our market-leading archiving products, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strength in e-Discovery in the federal -- including the U.S. federal government vertical and execution across all geographies. Last month, we released Enterprise Vault 9, which includes support for Exchange 2010, hosted Exchange, Sharepoint 2010 and enhanced discovery features.", "Moving on to Enterprise Security, our Hosted Services business realized another quarter of double-digit bookings growth, driven by the rapid adoption of our SaaS-based security solutions. We are beating the competition worldwide and realizing growth across all regions. By leveraging the Symantec sales force, we are extending our customer and geographic reach.", "We won a competitive contract with Internet Solutions, a leading South African ISP to provide hosted messaging security services to over 225,000 users. We're also seeing a positive response for our new hosted Endpoint Protection service launched in May. This offering provides comprehensive security for desktops, laptops and servers as a hosted service without the need to install additional hardware or management software.", "Our leading DLP security product continues to be a growth driver for our Enterprise Security business, posting another quarter of double-digit bookings growth. Both Vontu and Message Labs are examples of acquisitions that we've been able to effectively integrate and grow consistently in highly competitive markets.", "We continue to use DLP to capture mind share with CISOs and cross-sell our security portfolio. As a result, we're seeing increased interest in our security suites, which include our Endpoint Protection and mail security products. Recently, independent research from PassMark ranked Symantec Endpoint Protection number one in overall performance for both the enterprise and SMB markets, beating our nearest competitors.", "As expected, Encryption is a complementary sale to our DLP solutions. ECI Telecommunications, a global networking infrastructure provider in Israel, signed a multi-year deal, which includes our encryption and DLP products.", "The PGP and GuardianEdge acquisitions exceeded our expectations in the September quarter. The team has done an outstanding job of integrating sales and operations. We are now positioned as a leader in the 2010 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Data Protection, receiving the highest rating in the Vision category. When we acquired PGP and GuardianEdge, we outlined several near-term goals. First, use the acquired technologies to enhance our ability to make data protection more intelligent. Second, utilize the broad Symantec distribution network to grow these businesses. And third, integrate PGP's encryption management platform into the Symantec protection Center.", "Let me give you an update on where we are today. Earlier this month, we announced the integration of our removal storage encryption offering with Data Loss Prevention. By integrating encryption and DLP capabilities, customers can utilize central policies to automate the identification of sensitive content and intelligently drive encryption.", "We also announced the integration of Intel's Antitheft Technology into PGP Whole Disk Encryption. With this release, customers will be able to use Symantec's PGP technology to remotely disable a lost or stolen notebook and reactivate it if the system is recovered.", "To take advantage of Symantec's distribution strength, we introduced our new encryption solutions to our partners and are working on program initiatives that encourage them to sell these offerings. We also integrated the Encryption sales group into our specialist team. The sales team quickly started cross-selling on Encryption Solutions with DLP and other security products into various customer segments and verticals, such as the public sector and financial services, with particular strength in the Americas.", "Lastly, we combined the engineering teams to work closely on the integration of PGP's encryption management platform with Symantec's Protection Center. We are on schedule to launch the integrated console by the middle of next year.", "On August 9, we closed the acquisition of VeriSign Security business, and our results exceeded our expectations. The SSL certificate installed base grew 16% year-over-year as we realized growth in both the premium and low-end segments. During 2009, the macroeconomic environment was a headwind for the SSL business. However, we've seen the business improve, generating its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year bookings growth. The addition of unique features such as daily malware scans and seal-in-search are driving VeriSign's SSL sales and renewals higher. Seal-in-search is a feature that differentiates VeriSign's SSL customers by including the VeriSign Trust Seal in online search results. We are utilizing or GeoTrust and Thawte SSL offerings to aggressively go after the price-sensitive segments of the market and gain share.", "The VeriSign authentication assets are critical to achieving our vision of securing and managing information and identities. As a result, we have the following near-term goals. One, leverage the Symantec sales force to expand adoption of user authentication. Two, cross-sell these technologies into the installed base; and three, make our consumer and enterprise products more identity-aware.", "To leverage the Symantec distribution network, user authentication services are already being sold by the combined sales force, and the response from customers has been very positive. The VeriSign telesales team is already cross-selling Symantec's Critical Systems Protection and we plan to launch VeriSign's authentication products integrated with Symantec Protection Center, as well as launch integrated seal-in-search into Norton Safe Web by the end of the fiscal year.", "I'm pleased with the progress we're making in integrating all three of our recent acquisitions and the team's focus on our key priorities. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected second quarter results in each of our key financial metrics. Our performance was driven by strength in our Backup and Archiving, Hosted Securities Services and Data Loss Prevention businesses.", "In addition, our three acquisitions exceeded our expectations. We prudently managed our expenses and generated another quarter of strong cash flows. GAAP revenue of $1.48 billion increased 2% in constant-currency terms versus the September 2009 period. The content, subscription and maintenance line accounted for 86% of our revenue, of which approximately 40 percentage points came from our consumer, Software-as-a-Service and authentication solutions. These offerings are solely subscription-based and represent a significant portion of our new business growth. However, this new business is not included in our license revenue line.", "The U.S. dollar strengthens 10% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period, decreasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. As a result, foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points year-over-year. Net income of $266 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Excluding the purchase accounting related deferred revenue write-downs of $49 million from our three recent acquisitions, EPS would have increased by $0.04 to $0.38 compared to $0.36 in the September 2009 quarter.", "As a reminder, with the acquisition of VeriSign's Security business, we now own the majority of VeriSign Japan. The consolidated revenue and expenses for VSJ are included in our income statement, with an adjustment below the net income line to account for the income attributable to the noncontrolling minority interest.", "Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $741 million increased 3% year-over-year and accounted for 50% of total GAAP revenue. Revenue was flat in the EMEA region while the Americas and Asia Pacific/Japan regions increased year-over-year by 3% and 5%, respectively. It's interesting to note that the euro and the yen moved in opposite directions with respect to the U.S. dollar during the quarter. This has been reflected in our currency-adjusted growth rates for the EMEA and APJ regions.", "Now, I'd like to move on to GAAP revenue and GAAP operating margin by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $468 million. It reduced Consumer revenue by approximately $10 million due to a onetime charge resulting from certain consumers not receiving their subscription entitlements on a timely basis. Excluding this item, Consumer revenue increased 3% year-over-year as reported and 5% year-over-year after adjusting for foreign exchange.", "Our Consumer segment's GAAP operating margin was 45% as compared to 47% in the September 2009 quarter. The margin decline was driven by the onetime charge. We remain focused on upselling consumers to our premium suites. Norton 360 continues to generate double-digit revenue growth versus the reported results in the year-ago period and accounted for 39% of total Consumer revenue.", "Turning now to our Enterprise business. We generated a total of 320 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 15% year-over-year. 59 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, down 16% year-over-year. Of our deals valued up more than $300,000, 74% included more than one of our products, and 42% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments, emphasizing our ability to cross-sell our broad product portfolio.", "The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $557 million and increased 1% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 8% year-over-year. We continued to see strong demand for our award-winning Backup and Archiving Solutions, which generated double-digit bookings growth in the September quarter.", "Revenue from our Storage Management business declined 8% year-over-year. OEM royalty declines from Sun-Oracle represented approximately 1/3 of the year-over-year decline. Our Storage and Server Management segment GAAP operating margin was 49%, flat as compared to the September 2009 quarter.", "The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $363 million, up 7% year-over-year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for both our DLP and Software-as-a-Service solutions. Total revenue for our three recently acquired businesses was $33 million compared to our expectations of $26 million. Specifically, PGP and GuardianEdge exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $15 million. The VeriSign Security acquisition also performed better than expected, generating revenue of $18 million.", "The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.03, which was $0.01 less diluted than our expectation of $0.04. Our Security and Compliance segment GAAP operating margin was 16% as compared to 26% in the September 2009 quarter, driven by increased expenses from our three acquisitions. Excluding the deferred revenue write-downs, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 26%.", "Our Services business generated revenue of $92 million, a decrease of 9% as compared to the September 2009 quarter. Our Services segment GAAP operating margin was 9% as compared to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. We remain focused on supporting our partner-less consulting program, which is driving a commensurate reduction in low-margin consulting revenue.", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2% for the September 2010 quarter, down 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold increased as this line item now includes credit card fees, driven by our new eCommerce store and also reflects our increased investment in offshore technical support centers. And non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% was down 300 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the acquired deferred revenue write-down, our operating margin for the September quarter would have been 27.5%.", "Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $310 million, up 37% year-over-year as reported. The strength was primarily driven by improvements in working capital and lower tax payments. During the last 12 months, we have generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.74 billion.", "We exited the September quarter with $2.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with approximately 50% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of two tranches of investment-grade senior unsecured notes. A total of $350 million of 2.75% notes will mature in September 2015, and $750 million of 4.2% notes will mature in September 2020. Shortly after issuing these notes, we repaid $500 million of our convertible senior notes due in June 2011. $600 million of these convertible notes remain outstanding.  Separately, we renewed our $1 billion revolving line of credit during September, extending its term for another four years.", "During the quarter, we spent $1.28 billion to acquire VeriSign Security business. In addition, we spent $225 million to repurchase approximately 17 million shares at an average price of $13.16. We have $322 million remaining on our current Board-authorized share repurchase plan.", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of September 2010 was $3.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations and reflected in part strong quarter end execution by our Enterprise sales team.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2010 quarter. We're assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro for the December 2010 quarter versus the $1.48 per euro that we experienced during the December 2009 quarter, equivalent to approximately a 10% currency headwind. Also, the end of period rate for the December 2009 quarter was $1.43 per euro versus our $1.35 per euro assumption, equivalent to approximately a 6% currency headwind.", "Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 780 million shares and an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27%. Thus for the December 2010 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.59 billion as compared to revenue of $1.55 billion during the December 2009 quarter. We are expecting PGP and GuardianEdge to contribute $18 million and the VeriSign Security business to contribute $38 million to our December quarter revenue. These acquisition-related assumptions are already included in our revenue guidance.", "We expect year-over-year revenue growth to be up 2% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.37 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.32 and $0.33 as compared to $0.40 in the year ago period. We expect $0.045 of dilution as a result of our three new acquisitions. Specifically, we expect VeriSign to dilute EPS by $0.04 and PGP and GuardianEdge together to dilute EPS by $0.005 in the December quarter.", "In addition, our December quarter EPS guidance includes approximately $0.01 of dilution as a result of the recent senior note issuance and credit facility replacements, which is not currently fully reflected in consensus estimates for the December and March quarters. Including $65 million of deferred revenue write-down amortization for the December quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would increase by $0.06 and would be between $0.38 and $0.39.", "We expect GAAP deferred revenue to be between $3.19 billion and $3.22 billion compared to $3.05 billion at the end of December 2009. We expect deferred revenue to be up 5% to 6% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. We expect approximately 68% or $1.08 billion of our December quarter revenue to come from the balance sheet.", "In closing, we will continue to focus on integrating our recent acquisitions, managing costs and generating strong cash flows while we reallocate resources into the growth areas of our company. And now, I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Glenn, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While Glenn is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We'll be presenting at several conferences this quarter. In addition, we'll be reporting our fiscal third quarter results on January 26. For a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit our Events Calendar on the IR website. Glenn, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I think, Enrique, you spoke about lower conversions for some of lower-end PCs and that's just sort of a reflection of the PC market out there, and it sounds like you're sort of adjusting your approach to that and you're going more aggressively after different distribution models, I guess and you mentioned some ISPs. Should we expect to see you even increase your aggression in these different distribution models which really are up until, I don't know, beginning of this year was somewhat foreign to Symantec? Actually, I shouldn't say that. You weren't really aggressive up until this year. Should we see you continue to adapt to the market itself in this regard?", "Enrique Salem", "Two comments on that. One, what we've have always done is looked at a multi-channel customer acquisition approach. And so we always are saying what are the different ways we can bring new customers' into the Norton products and you heard me outline a range of different things. We've got our products that allow us to have customers scan their PC and check if they've got any malware on it, and then we upsell them to our full antivirus products. So we've got things like we call Norton Security Scan, which is an online delivery technology. The other thing that we're always doing is, in the ISP segment, we have a range of big accounts that we work with for many years. T-Online and others had been using our services and delivering them. From an ISP perspective, you saw us win Comcast about a year ago now. And so, we're always going to look at the ISP channel. What I did want to make sure is clear is that PC unit shipments, we expect to still grow year-over-year, December over December. What we have seen was a bit of a mix shift to lower-end devices, probably driven by a netbook phenomenon. And the netbook, as we've said, had a slightly lower conversion rate. We expect, at this point though, that there'll be stability in the consumer revenue growth rate off of these levels that we achieved in the September quarter.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just one quick follow-up for James. James, you pointed out the really strong cash flow here, which is much greater than at least we were looking for, and I think most. And you said it was assisted by meaningful changes in working capital and tax, and we can see in the receivables in line and also in deferred revenue. Just wondering if you could just comment on how much of this had to do with, I guess, the more meaningful VeriSign acquisition made in the quarter? Or was it just like on receivables, just good collections in the quarter? What was happening there?", "James Beer", "There's a modest effect from the VeriSign acquisition. But really, it was driven by just core working capital.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "James, I'm wondering just on the license revenue. I noticed that, that's still declined in the quarter by about 4% or 5%. And I note your commentary around some of the products that are growing around the ratable [ph] model. But should we assume that we start to see a turnaround in that license revenue? Or is that not necessary for you to achieve that sort of growth rate that you'd like to see, given some of the changes you discussed?", "James Beer", "Well, we were actually quite pleased with the trend line in the license line sequentially. So on a constant-currency basis, it was down a couple of percentage points year-over-year. But you'll recall, a quarter ago, we were up 15% year-over-year, so quite pleased with how that line is going. I just really wanted to remind everyone that a loss of our new business goes in what is often referred to as the maintenance line. But of course, that's where all of subscription activity goes as it is initially sold. And that's becoming increasingly important as we sell more hosted services. It's always being important on the consumer side of our business.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "James, a follow-up on that. I didn't hear you talk about the percentages or, I guess, the number for revenue coming off the balance sheet next quarter, sort of what you saw this quarter. Would you be willing to provide that, given it is becoming and it sounds like it's a much more important part of the business?", "James Beer", "Yes. It's going to be around 68%, coming off the balance sheet.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Of the expected revenue in December, off the balance sheet?", "James Beer", "That's going to be just a little over $1 billion, $1.08 billion. And then of course, another driver of the maintenance subscription line is VeriSign. And obviously, that's going to be a bigger impact. We'll have a full first quarter of that business in December.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Heather Bellini with ISI Group.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, we've been hearing a lot about the popularity of tablets and whether or not it's cannibalistic to consumer PC sales, which obviously, can still be debated. But Enrique, I was wondering if you could share with us what your thoughts are for how your consumer security strategy might change as tablets become an increasing percentage of units?", "Enrique Salem", "What our consumer team has been very focused on is the initiatives that take us beyond the PC. And in my comments, I referenced our Norton Everywhere initiative, which is basically our ability to deliver across any type of device, more services that are coming off the network like our DNS offering. And what we've fundamentally believed is that we have to be able to deliver capabilities across a range of these new devices, whether it be Android, BlackBerry, Apple and we see that as an opportunity. These new smart devices, our expectation is that next year, there'll be more smart devices connecting to the Internet and PCs, and that's why our team is focused on a number of these new initiatives across, not only the Consumer business, but also in the enterprise market, where our teams are delivering new capabilities to do a better job of helping enterprises, secure the devices but also manage the devices. And so it's a combination of aggressive new capabilities in the consumer business like Norton Everywhere and then also the work that we're doing on the Enterprise.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "In the Storage business, Enrique, you talked about NetBackup growing mid-single-digits and Backup Exec growing double digits. But overall, the growth there it's still just 1% in total. I think it's a little bit of what Walter was asking. When does whatever is in decline, which I'm assuming is mostly Storage Foundation suite and so forth. When is that cut enough [ph] so that your healthy businesses can show through in the growth rates?", "Enrique Salem", "We're probably facing several more quarters of the Sun-Oracle OEM deal, and that will be one of the headwinds for that business. Now, we did introduce, and I talked about the new App HA technology, the new virtual store technology in combination with Data Insight. So the combination of lapping the OEM agreement with Sun and then bringing on these new technologies should allow the businesses that are shining through like BackUp Exec, our new DLP products, our range of new capabilities to shine through on the growth rate. And that's really going to take probably a couple of more quarters.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So when VeriSign was bought, it was doing about $70 million a quarter in its Storage business. And I think you got it for $38 million for the December quarter. And I understand there's a deferred revenue write-down going on, but James, does it take a whole 12 months to get back to the prior run rate whether deferred revenue write-down is finished? Or should that start to happen a little bit more quickly as you get through the year?", "James Beer", "It would take at least a full year. In fact, some of the deferred revenue based upon the contract terms that VeriSign signed, is actually a little longer than 12 months. So certainly, the significant majority of the effect will play through after the first full year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley", "I was wondering if you could delve into the Consumer business a little bit and the lower conversion rates you're seeing there, with the PC initiative towards lower-end units. Are you seeing any sort of similar shift in ASPs of that lower units where, I mean, PC Tools is more prevalent? And similar shift in ASPs, was this just on conversion rates?", "Enrique Salem", "The current pricing has remained very stable, and what we are seeing is that as we move from this to 360, that's always a positive for us, where we are able to upsell our customers to the higher price point products. The specific issue is really driven by just the mix shift that we saw to the netbooks. And my expectation is that we'll probably see a year-over-year growth in total units shipped December over December. And that should have a positive effect.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley", "And then just on the conversion rate side, could you give us some background on sort of how long you guys have been seeing this decline in conversion rates? And I think, you guys had talked about bringing the eCommerce platform in house. Part of that reason was to increase the conversion rates. What's your planning assumption of what the timeframe would be to when you could actually start to see results from having the eCommerce platform in house?", "Enrique Salem", "Let me take the second half and I'll let James take the first half. So if you look at the platform, the eCommerce platform, we've now had that up for a year, and it's performed as expected. Quite frankly, I'm very pleased with how effectively our team has executed on bringing that in-house. I mean, completely transparent to our customers and the ability to be more targeted, the ability to deliver new services that we're starting to outline is absolutely a positive for the Consumer business. And so that is already built in. Expect us to continue to extend that platform beyond just the Consumer segment to leverage it across other segments and to bring in other products. And so that transition has been very positive, and we'll continue to be a positive, not just for the consumer business but over time, the entire company.", "James Beer", "And as to when we started to see the conversion rate that we've been referring to, we saw some first hints of this in the June quarter. But the June quarter is a seasonally low quarter anyway for the business. So as we move into September and saw that continuation and in fact, some of the deepening effect, clearly, it was an issue that it was worth discussing.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley", "Could you just briefly give us a little bit more color on that issue that caused the $10 million one-time reduction? Why were those consumers not getting the updates on that?", "James Beer", "This relates to a group of consumers that we heard also renewed but haven't made the additional step to actually renew their subscription. So in essence, we had recognized that revenue sooner than we should have done, so we baked it out in this quarter. It's a very small portion of the population, well, well less than 1% or so.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Enrique, in your prepared remarks, you talked about technologies like DLP, driving the security conversation higher within the customer organization up to the CISO level. And when I look to the deals that you're doing and deal size and your deal metrics, it seems like the number of $1 million-plus deals are consistently coming down. And I guess just as we've tried to resolve what's happening here, I was hoping you could maybe comment a little bit about the customers' willingness to purchase forward, something that you've talked about a little bit in the past? And how we should think about large deals and maybe what the megadeal metrics were in the quarter?", "Enrique Salem", "You said it exactly right. You focused on the point, Brad, that customers are not pre-buying years two and three. There's really no reason at this point for them to do that, given what they saw in 2009, while 2010 obviously, there's improved confidence than we saw in previous years. There's no move to say we'll pre-buy years two and three, so that's not changing. The other thing to focus on the discussions moving up to the CISO is some of those deals are for one or two of the technologies. They're not necessarily buying all of the DLP technologies so that gives us an opportunity, for example, to sell the initial functionality of DLP and then come back and sell the next set of capabilities. And so as we look at the big deal metrics, given that I don't expect anyone to start buying or prebuying the outyears, the one factor that will have an effect is historically, the first half of the year is seasonally a little bit slower than the second half of the year from the big deals as people ramp into both our calendar year and our fiscal year end. So that's what will drive all the improvements in the big deal metrics. But again, I don't expect prebuying to begin at all during this fiscal year.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "One follow-up for, I guess, James. On employee headcount, where you ended up the quarter, it appears even if I back out what was acquired, you were net hires. I guess the question there is were there redundancies that came from VeriSign? And what do you expect in your hiring plans going forward?", "James Beer", "There's a very modest change in non-acquired headcount quarter-over-quarter. So I think that just reflects the fact that as I mentioned in the notes that we're already looking to manage our expenses as tightly as we can, and that continues to be the strength as we move forward here. Yes, we're absolutely looking to redirect resources to the higher growth parts of the business, but we're, while doing that, mindful of the overall financial picture, obviously.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Neil Herman with Soleil Securities.", "Neil Herman - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment particularly vis-a-vis McAfee? Given the Intel acquisition, are you seeing any significant changes competitively in that portion of the market? And then as a follow-up, a few quarters ago, we had Google and a number of other companies that were apparently penetrated now. We seem to have this Stuxnet worm. Are you starting to see some of these issues translate into increased business in the segments of your business as well?", "Enrique Salem", "From a competitive perspective, it's still very early. As you know, the McAfee-Intel deal hasn't closed, and so we haven't seen any changes. While you get questions and everybody believes it will be a distraction for the McAfee team, it's pretty clear that it's still very early to really see any effects. We do see it as an opportunity for us. With regards to the threat environment, it's becoming a lot more toxic. I mean, Stuxnet is an example of an attack on the industrial control systems, and this has just raised the awareness of something that all of us who focus on protecting critical infrastructure have known would absolutely become an issue. And so when you have an issue like this, it raises awareness and people turn to the largest security company in the world and that's Symantec, so we see it as absolutely a positive. It opens up a lot of conversations with our customers, and it allows us to talk to them about the best ways of protecting themselves, in this, again very, toxic or cyberthreat environment.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "Enrique, if you could just characterize your pipeline for the second half here? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're slightly more confident about what you're seeing. And I was wondering if you could help us just characterize how that pipeline feels versus the first half and what you saw last year. And then for James, on the operating margin, is there any reason to believe why you shouldn't be able to get back above 30% at some point, considering some of these factors seem to be one-off issues that you're going through right now and that should pass here with time?", "Enrique Salem", "I'll take the first part of the question. What you see is our ability to integrate -- these acquisitions has gone very well. I commented on DLP, I commented on the MessageLabs, both VeriSign, GuardianEdge and PGP. All of these acquisitions are being very rapidly integrated and are performing well for us. My expectations as we're going into a seasonally stronger period, and I believe that we should see results that are consistent with what we've seen in years, where we're not facing IT budgets being down 9%. So I'm confident that our execution's improving, and I'm confident that the integration of the acquisitions is going well, and I believe that we should see a typically stable end to this fiscal year, nothing that is unexpected on either the up or the downside of this point.", "James Beer", "And Brent, in terms of operating margins, back at Analyst Day, I thought that operating margins could get back to the 30% level in the next three years, and I think the September quarter is a good example of how we've been able to integrate well around the acquisitions,  around the rest of the business. We've had good execution, I noted the strong end of quarter, the Enterprise business had. And as we work to continue to do that, I think we can achieve the goals that I laid out at Analyst Day.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "First of all, with the discussion around the Consumer business and conversion rates around the low end, can you just remind us with the HP renewal, when did the new economics kick in? And does that give you more flexibility around this issue, and should that positively impact the profitability of the Consumer business?", "Enrique Salem", "When we look at that deal, that deal is targeted to begin in the first quarter next year in January. And as you look at the business, we really haven't commented on the economics, but as we've always said, we're not going to be deals that don't make economic sense. And so I'd rather not going to the details of that deal, given that it is confidential.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then second question, you guys commented that VeriSign has a sell-through that were up 16% year-over-year, which is a significant acceleration. Can you talk about what you saw from a pricing perspective? And any sense for whether you think that uptick on the unit side is sustainable?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, well, we've been pleased by the first couple of months of operations of the VeriSign business. Certainly, unit growth has been quite strong on both the lower-end brands and the flagship VeriSign brand. And the pricing picture, we've seen nice improvements there in the last few quarters of the business. And so put it all together, you've got a good top line story and I think that is before we start utilizing the benefits that we've been talking about earlier in terms of cross-selling capability, integrating it into Symantec Management console and those sorts of things. So all in all, we're pretty pleased with how things are evolving there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I don't think anyone's asked about the Storage side. You had a nice uptick there sequentially. Obviously, we've seen a lot of M&A in this area for some crazy premiums. Can you just give us some thoughts on how you're positioned in Storage in terms of management?", "James Beer", "What you see is really a situation where some of the new technologies that are getting a lot of attention, we've been clearly the market leader in these technologies. Things like thin provisioning using solid state drives, the new FileStore technology. So we're positioned well to take advantage of some of these new technologies that customers are trying to get deployed. The thing that continues to be the headwind is that we've got to lap the OEM agreement with Sun-Oracle. But in general, the attention that deduplication, thin provisioning, virtualization are currently getting, are very positive for both the Storage Management business and the Backup and Archiving business. And so my expectations are that we will see continued results in Backup and Archiving and then some improvements in the core Storage Management business.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I'd just like to talk about the PC business and the mix change there. And you've been clear that, that's impacted kind of the close rates you're seeing. But has there been any commensurate impact with the sliding fees that you pay or any benefit in seeing that going down as a result of this change in mix?", "Enrique Salem", "What you see is that as we negotiate the agreements, we're always thinking about what are the conversion rates, not just in the high-end versus low-end units but also geographically. And so our team is very sensitive to modeling what are the appropriate, whether it be fees or rev shares or any of the different contracts or the contract vehicles, where we're always trying to understand how units are going to flow to the market, because we completely understand, for example, conversion rates here in the United States are higher than in emerging markets. And so we adjust for that when we look at payments. The same is true when we think about high-end units or non-netbooks, and we definitely adjust the payments based on that. And so as we renew agreements, as we get better knowledge of what conversion rates look like, we always take that into account. Netbooks have now been out for more than a year, and so as we've renewed to these agreements, that's been a factor in our thinking. It should be a positive ultimately for what we ultimately pay, given the conversion data that we have.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then maybe you can give us a quick update on the Symantec Protection Center? Where we are there in adoption and how that's being received early on?", "Enrique Salem", "I'm extremely pleased with how it's being received. Our team did a great job of delivering it, and what we now have is the Management console that allows us to integrate a range of our products, as you heard in both James and my comments around the VeriSign business, around the PGP business, around our hosted services business, all of that work is being done around SPC and that's been due to the very big positive from our customers, especially our largest customers who have multiple Symantec products installed.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Philip Rueppel with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Philip Rueppel", "On the Enterprise side of the business, I recall last quarter you had mentioned that due to the lengthening of sales cycles that you had assumed lower close rates. Given your commentary about how the quarter ended and the pipelines going forward, are you assuming, are you 're going back to normal assumptions for close rates, or are we still in somewhat of a depressed environment?", "Enrique Salem", "The close rates, obviously, as you go into the seasonally stronger period or you go into the calendar year end, we always have models that we work off of from previous years. And then we also take into account the current environment. So my expectation is we don't expect that there's a dramatic improvement in confidence, so we expect it to be stable and we've modeled in what we believe is the appropriate close rates. But again, this is a little stronger seasonal period because of the calendar year end, and we've obviously taken that into account into our guidance.", "Philip Rueppel", "And you mentioned some of the earlier progress you're making in the mobile market. How should we measure that going forward? And sort of what is your go-to-market strategy going to be focused around platform providers? And you gave us some end-user accounts, but is it really going to be driven by service providers and platform providers? And how should we think about measuring your success going forward?", "Enrique Salem", "As you look at our long-term vision, we see mobility, smart devices as becoming a very important part of what everybody is doing, whether it's an individual consumer and enterprise. When you take into account go-to-market, enterprises are going to buy from either the channel partner or from our own team, so our expectation is that the Enterprise segment will be a traditional enterprise sale. When you look at the consumer market, obviously, we see opportunities to use handset providers and nontraditional OEMs for our business and a number of those relationships that we have been working on. And obviously, we'll continue to go through our customer base because many of our customers that have been using our consumer products are now moving to some of these new devices, and our expectation is that we'll be able to, in effect, cross-sell to those customers. So it's a combination of selling to Enterprise, working with carriers and handset providers and then also cross-selling our consumer base.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rob Breza  with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Enrique, I wanted to talk about the new or the joint venture by looking at some of the press releases and expectations you're making, it looks like currency in the North American market a few weeks ago. Well, let me just get to your expectations there and understanding how you're viewing that joint venture longer term? I understand there's a one-time option here in a couple of weeks that comes up. And really, how you're going to be using that joint venture to target the North American market and how you see that going into the competitive landscape?", "Enrique Salem", "Our customers continue to look for solutions in both on-premise in software appliances and then hosted or Software-as-a-Service. So our expectations is part of the appliance capability is going to be working closely with the joint venture. As you probably know, a majority of hardware today is already being built in China. And so we're able to leverage a relationship with one of the largest tech companies in China as a strategic partner. And so we will absolutely be taking a number of different appliances to market, some developed by the joint venture, some with the content developed by Symantec into markets all over the world. We had this June quarter, we saw some of the initial sales outside of the U.S. for the appliances that we've developed with the JV, and my expectation is that, that will be technology that we deliver all over the world, including the United States.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "James, maybe a follow-up to Enrique's comments, if you look at the 2% additional stake, and correct me if I'm wrong here on my math, but it looks like the additional 2% stake would cost you about $28 million giving you the 51% controlling ownership. Just looking at that based the value of the last 10-K, 10-Q you put out had $51 million, really would imply about a $1.4 billion valuation for that. Is my math correct there?", "James Beer", "That's all correct, yes, and the option comes available to us in February of next year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I just wanted to focus on sales force productivity. Obviously, you guys saw a good bounce back quarter-to-quarter and license sales up after you mentioned some deals slipped during our fiscal Q1. When you think about what programs, et cetera, that you've got in place, you'd sort of keep that consistency back on place here, just what are those? And then also, Enrique, when you do think about your channel model right now, any tweaks that you're making in that program?", "Enrique Salem", "The channel program, we continue to drive our partners towards more specialization in the portfolio, and that's working well because we're bringing on partners that are security or DLP experts. We're bringing partners that are Backup or Archiving experts because these products require true specialization. We've also set it up so that partners can work together, so that there is a benefit to somebody saying, \"If I specialize on Backup or Archiving and I need to bring in somebody who has expertise in DLP, we've worked out a channel model and an incentive model that allows our partners to both be successful, while being very targeted in these notion of specialization.\" When you think about the sales force, we've got a cost structure and incentive structure that's typically put in place at the beginning of the year and we're running with that structure. Obviously, at this point, given that we've done the three new acquisitions, there's a lot of enthusiasm in the sales force because everywhere we've sold our DLP products, there's now more opportunities to sell our Encryption products. And so our sales force is seeing a real opportunity around some of the new acquisitions. Our conference though are stable from the beginning of the year, and we will look at what we need to do as we go into fiscal year '12.", "Enrique Salem", "I just like to conclude by saying that we're pleased with our execution during the September quarter. In particular, we're pleased with the strength of our Backup and Archiving, SaaS and DLP businesses and the progress we've made in integrating our acquisitions. I'm optimistic about our prospects for the December quarter, and I would like to thank you all for joining us this afternoon, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thanks everyone. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our call to discuss fiscal third quarter 2011 fiscal results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss how Symantec executed during the quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's release and supplemental information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results, focusing on year-over-year current constant currency rate, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. For December 2010 quarter, the weighted average exchange rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro. For the December '09 quarter, the weighted average rate was $1.48 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.43 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and as-reported growth rates in our press release and in our supplemental information. Please note, due to recent fluctuations in currency rates, we have decided to guide to an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro for the March 2011 quarter, contrary to the original foreign currency view of $1.30 we noted on our January 12, 2011, foreign currency update. ", "Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contains forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found on the company's most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. Now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique Salem", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our double-digit bookings growth and solid performance across all product lines and regions. This led to better-than-expected results and drove record deferred revenue. We benefited from strength in Consumer, Backup and Data Loss Prevention, as well as stability in the Storage Management business. In addition, our recent acquisitions exceeded expectations and continue to deliver strong results. Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. ", "Consumer delivered another solid quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by the strength of our market-leading products and breadth of our multi-channel distribution. We continue to expand our free Norton Security Scan and Norton PC Checkup services into alternative channels such as DivX, W3i, Mindspark, LG Electronics, Paltalk, ICBC and Adobe. These types of new relationships allow us to reach more than 350 million consumers that may not be using traditional Norton products and introduce them to our full line of security suites and services. The trend in our trial conversion rates stabilized during the quarter, as the team continued to focus on enhancing the trial experience. Our ability to target offerings through our dynamic eCommerce platform benefited subscription renewals and helped us to upsell and cross sell consumers to our premium suites and services. Our new 2011 products offer the fastest and most effective security protection without sacrificing PC performance. The 2011 products have won 54 awards and received 329 positive reviews, more than any other competitor. ", "Our Backup and Archiving business, NetBackup, posted double-digit bookings growth, driven by strong demand for virtual machine protection and deduplication. We're the only company to provide deduplication at the client at the media server through either software or an appliance. Our new NetBackup 5200 appliance series is the industry's first all-in-one hardware and software backup solution with integrated deduplication. Initial customer response has been very positive. We continue to see strong customer adoption of our capacity-based pricing model, which positions us well to take advantage of the growth in unstructured information. ", "In the SMB segment, Backup Exec generated its third consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. We are seeing increased loyalty from our channel partners as we continue to build momentum in the SMB market. Windows IT Pro named Backup Exec the Best Backup Software Product. In addition, Redmond magazine selected Backup Exec as the best backup and recovery product for the fifth consecutive year. ", "Performance of our Storage Management business stabilized during the quarter. For example, State Street Bank chose to expand their use of Storage Foundation throughout their business-critical data centers because of our unique ability to manage heterogeneous IT environments. Customers value our ability to help them reduce cost and accelerate the adoption of virtualization and cloud solutions. ", "Our Enterprise Security business delivered solid results, with strength in Data Loss Prevention and our recent acquisitions. Recent media attention surrounding WikiLeaks and sophisticated malware attacks, such as Aurora and Stuxnet, have resulted in increased CISO interest in our leading data protection solutions. The complimentary nature of our encryption offerings, coupled with our Data Loss Prevention solutions, help customers prevent information loss. In addition, we make it possible for customers to secure industrial control systems and build out smart grid infrastructures. By addressing these challenges, we are developing meaningful customer relationships, allowing us to cross sell more of our Endpoint and Mail Security suites, especially in the largest enterprises in the world. ", "Our recent acquisitions also drove strength in our Enterprise Security business. I'm very pleased with the team's focus on growing these businesses and integrating operations. The Trust Services team, which manages our SSL business, achieved its highest bookings in nine quarters and grew the installed base double-digits. We are driving increased enterprise adoption of our premium VeriSign SSL offerings with unique features, such as certificate management, malware scans and Seal-in-Search. In addition, we are successfully taking advantage of our GeoTrust and Thawte brands to take share in the more price-sensitive segments of the market. ", "We completed the integration of VeriSign's management console into Symantec Protection Center. We also completed the integration of Seal-in-Search into our Norton security products. Through Norton, we are already generating more than 75 million additional Trust Seal impressions per day. Furthermore, we are leveraging VeriSign's retail website to cross sell our Norton products. We continue to leverage the PGP and GuardianEdge encryption products in our distribution channels, and have moved quickly to integrate encryption technologies across the portfolio. We shipped Symantec Endpoint Encryption 8.0, which supports a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows Mobile and BlackBerry. With the global enterprise sales force now selling our user authentication and encryption offerings, we are generating healthy pipeline growth. ", "In summary, the great strides we've made in effectively integrating acquired technologies and leveraging our distribution network are making a difference in our ability to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. ", "Now I'd like to discuss a few of the initiatives driving long-term growth for Symantec in the areas of mobile, virtualization and cloud adoption. Let's start with mobile. Mobile devices are increasingly being used in both our personal and business lives, offering productivity increases but also creating new security and management challenges. Our solutions manage and protect mobile devices by enforcing governance, securing corporate data and increasing visibility of all mobile platforms. We offer Mobile Management and Endpoint Protection capabilities for Android and Apple iOS, in addition to Windows Mobile, Symbian and BlackBerry. These solutions include features such as remote wipe, password policy enforcement and device inventory. Customers can utilize our DLP solutions to mitigate the risk of data loss through mobile devices. Our cloud-based e-mail security offerings allow enterprises to confidently adopt mobile solutions. In addition, our recent acquisitions extend our reach within the mobile markets with advanced mobile encryption and authentication solutions. ", "For the Consumer, our Norton Everywhere initiative provides a hassle-free online experience across mobile phones, tablets and smart devices. In January, we launched Norton DNS, which provides faster and more reliable Web browsing without requiring software to be downloaded onto the device. Our Norton Mobile Security offering is generating strong partner interest as we extend our multi-channel distribution network into these new areas. In retail, Best Buy Canada will soon offer Norton Mobile Security. Kingston Digital, the independent world leader in memory products and its software partner, FUHU, selected Norton as the security provider for their USB flash drives. Universo Online, Brazil's largest Internet service provider, began offering Norton mobile solutions to its customers. Expect to hear more about how we're expanding distribution of these new offerings at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month. While still early, I'm pleased with the progress we're making in seeding the mobile market. ", "Moving on to virtualization. Organizations are increasingly adopting virtualization to reduce costs, enhance flexibility and build public and private cloud infrastructures. As a result, environments become more complex and leave mission-critical applications and data unprotected. Our solutions help organizations secure, manage and optimize their virtual environments from the data center to the endpoint. Our enterprise solutions are already helping customers secure information and identities in both the virtual and physical environments. Our Symantec Endpoint Virtualization Suite helps customers save operational costs, optimize license consumption and employ a hybrid virtual solution in their environments. In addition, upcoming releases of our Data Insight solution will allow products to proactively apply security and compliance controls in a virtualized world. ", "NetBackup helps organizations protect, deduplicate and recover information in both physical and virtual environments through a single unified platform. Results from benchmark testing conducted in partnership with Cisco and VMware highlight NetBackup's ability to protect more than 3,200 virtual machines on a single backup host and deduplicate more than 98% of redundant information. NetBackup received the Best of VMworld Award in 2010 as a result of its market-leading data protection and virtual machine capabilities. NetBackup has won awards for virtual server protection three times in the last four years. With its monitoring plug-in feature for VMware, Backup Exec is the leader in protecting virtual environments for small- and medium-sized businesses. This new capability reduces the complexity of protecting data environments as a result of direct integration with VMware's vCenter. Backup Exec now protects an impressive 40,000 VMware hosts and an estimated 1 million VMware guests. ", "For the data center, some of our new initiatives help customers virtualize applications and databases with confidence. Application HA and VirtualStore, jointly developed with VMware, enable organizations to accelerate the virtualization of business-critical applications and reduce storage costs in virtual environments. We are seeing very good customer interest of all these solutions and expect them to provide long-term growth opportunities for the company. ", "And finally, customer adoption of the cloud. We have a broad portfolio of cloud-based solutions and services, from SaaS security to authentication services and online backup to cloud infrastructure management. These solutions help organizations lower cost and simplify IT administration, while keeping their information and identities secure. In addition to our cloud-based reputation security service, which processes over 4 billion ratings per day, we are delivering innovative solutions that can be accessed anytime and anywhere. Norton Online Backup continues to expand its cloud presence, with 13 million users and 67 petabytes of stored data, a 35% increase year-over-year. As more customers use Web-enabled devices, it's key that they be able to access their personal files, videos and pictures from the cloud. Our internally-developed Norton Connect application allows Norton Online Backup users to access their online information from their iPhone, their iPad or their Android device. We recently expanded our global Web-based Norton Online Family solution to include a paid Premiere version, with features such as online video monitoring, 90-day histories and automatic activity reports. In the enterprise, our Symantec.cloud, or SaaS offerings, serve more than 9 million business users in more than 100 countries. We continue to realize growth in our cloud-based messaging and Web security solutions, as customers look to simplify operations and reduce costs. Symantec Endpoint Protection.cloud, our internally developed hosted endpoint protection service continues to garner customer interest from the SMB to the large enterprise. ", "We will continue to deliver additional cloud services, including Data Loss Prevention and governance offerings in order to extend our lead in this fast-growing market. Our Managed Security Services help customers drive efficient and effective security management. This outsourced service offers real-time protection, security monitoring, advanced analysis and early warning intelligence for companies of all sizes around the globe. Our solution enables clients to not only protect their information assets but also comply with industry regulations. As a result of increased demand for these types of solutions, our MSS business generated record double-digit bookings growth this quarter. Our backup solutions are integrated with Cloud partners such as Nirvanix to enable customers to utilize cloud solutions for disaster recovery and reduce information management costs. Our archiving solution enables customers to take advantage of cloud offerings, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange Online while maintaining on-premise archiving for easy compliance and e-Discovery. Cloud computing creates opportunities for our Storage and Server Management business with SaaS providers and as customers build out their private clouds. Our platform-agnostic solution helps organizations reduce costs by commoditizing hardware and leveraging existing investments. Our products also help customers reduce complexity by simplifying the management of heterogeneous environments to build a scalable private cloud. In addition, we are able to help enterprise customers leverage public clouds. For example, customers who use Amazon's Web Services can leverage Storage Foundation to manage online storage without interrupting access to servers and critical applications. ", "In conclusion, these important trends will drive long-term growth for our company. I look forward to sharing more with you about the progress we're making with our customers and partners in these three areas. I'll now turn the call over to James to provide you the financial details for the quarter.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. I am pleased to report that Symantec posted better-than-expected third quarter results for each of our key financial metrics. We generated strong bookings and cash flow from operations. Our solid performance in revenue and deferred revenue was driven by stability in the Storage Management business and strength in our Consumer, Backup and Data Loss Prevention businesses. GAAP revenue of $1.6 billion increased 5% in constant currency terms versus the December 2009 period. Excluding the purchase accounting deferred revenue writedown, revenue growth would've been 9% in constant currency terms. The content, the subscription and maintenance line grew 6% year-over-year and accounted for 84% of our revenue. Approximately 40 percentage points of this amount is subscription revenue from our Consumer, SaaS and Authentication solutions. ", "License revenue declined 1% year-over-year, reflecting the second quarter of stabilization, as compared to the previous six quarters of double-digit declines. The U.S. dollar strengthened 9% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period, decreasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by one percentage point year-over-year and positively impacted revenue growth by two percentage points sequentially. GAAP deferred revenue at the end of December 2010 reached a record $3.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year, well exceeding our expectations. This was driven by solid bookings worldwide and our recent acquisitions. The tax rate for the quarter was 24%, below our guidance of 27% due to a one-time benefit from the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit and other one-time tax benefits recognized in the quarter. Net income of $272 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. $0.04 of EPS benefit came from better-than-expected revenue, lower OEM placement fees and one-time tax benefits. These benefits were offset by $0.02 of EPS dilution from higher-than-expected sales commissions, given the strong bookings in deferred revenue generated in the quarter. Excluding the purchase accounting-related deferred revenue writedown of $64 million from our three recent acquisitions, EPS would have been $0.06 higher at $0.41. The acquisitions were approximately $0.03 accretive to EPS, excluding the deferred revenue haircut. ", "Looking at our geographic results, international revenue of $837 million increased 9% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of total GAAP revenue. Asia Pacific/Japan revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas regions both increased 5% year-over-year. During the quarter, the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar while the yen and Singapore dollar strengthened against the U.S. dollar. We have accounted for these movements in our currency adjusted growth rates. ", "Now I'd like to move on to GAAP revenue and GAAP operating margin by segment. The Consumer business generated revenue of $498 million, up 5% year-over-year, as we leveraged our retail, OEM, ISP and online channels to attract and retain more consumers. Norton 360 generated another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and accounted for 38% of total Consumer revenue. We continue to expect stable revenue growth in the Consumer segment as we benefit from ongoing improvements in renewal rates, driven by our eCommerce platform, growth in PC units and enhancements to the trial experience. GAAP operating margin for our Consumer segment was 44% as compared to 43% in the December 2009 quarter. The operating margin improved year-over-year due to lower-than-expected OEM placement fees. ", "Turning now to our Enterprise business. We generated a total of 544 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 18% year-over-year. 118 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, up 9% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 77% included more than one of our products and 38% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our Security and Storage segments, emphasizing our ability to cross sell our broad product portfolio. ", "The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $600 million, an increase of 3% as compared to the December 2009 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 5% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our integrated solutions focused on deduplication and virtual environments. Revenue from our Storage Management business increased 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating margin for our Storage and Server Management segment was 46% as compared to 49% in the December 2009 quarter, driven by higher sales commission expenses resulting from strong bookings growth during the quarter. The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $417 million, up 14% year-over-year, driven by strength in DLP and our acquisitions. ", "Total revenue for the acquired businesses was $66 million compared to our expectation of $56 million. The VeriSign security acquisition performed better-than-expected, generating revenue of $48 million, while PGP and GuardianEdge posted revenue of $18 million. The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.035, $0.01 less dilutive than our expectation of $0.045. ", "GAAP operating margin for our Security and Compliance segment was 12%, as compared to 28% in the December 2009 quarter, primarily driven by increased expenses from our three acquisitions and higher sales commissions. Excluding the deferred revenue writedown, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 23%. Our Services business generated revenue of $89 million, as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. Our Managed Security Services business generated double-digit bookings growth, driven by increased adoption of our information security services within the Enterprise segment. ", "GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 7% as compared to 10% in the December 2009 quarter. ", "Turning now to total company margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 85.3% for the December 2010 quarter, down 110 basis points from the year-ago period, driven by the acquired VeriSign security business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6%, down 460 basis points compared to the December 2009 quarter, primarily driven by our recent acquisitions and higher commission expenses. Excluding the effect of the acquired deferred revenue writedown, our operating margin for the December quarter would have been 26.7%. Cash flow from operating activities for the December quarter totaled $460 million, up 17% year-over-year as reported. Cash flow benefited from acquisitions, higher billings and lower tax payments. During the last 12 months, we have generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from operations. We exited the December quarter with $2.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with 49% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we spent $265 million to repurchase approximately 16 million shares at an average price of $17.03. ", "We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and continue to be committed to returning value to our shareholders. With that goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. ", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the March 2011 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.38 per euro and the end-of-period rate of $1.35 per euro during the March 2010 quarter. Our guidance assumes a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 775 million shares and an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 27%. Thus, for the March 2011 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.585 billion to $1.605 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.53 billion during the March 2010 quarter. We are expecting acquisition-related revenue to total $70 million. The VeriSign security business is expected to generate $55 million and PGP and GuardianEdge are expected to contribute $15 million to our March quarter revenue. ", "We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 4% to 5% on an as-reported basis. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.15 and $0.16, as compared to $0.23 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.36, as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period. We expect $0.02 of dilution as a result of our VeriSign acquisition. PGP and GuardianEdge will be neutral to EPS in the March quarter as expected. In addition, our EPS guidance includes approximately $0.01 of dilution, resulting from our senior note issuance and credit facility replacement. Historically, PC unit shipments decline sequentially from December to March. While industry analysts are forecasting PC unit shipments to increase, a significant amount of unit growth will be driven from emerging markets. As a result, we expect OEM expenses to be flat sequentially. ", "Including $48 million of deferred revenue writedown amortization for the March quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would be higher by approximately $0.05 and would be between $0.40 and $0.41. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.61 billion and $3.64 billion, compared to $3.21 billion at the end of March 2010. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 13% to 14% on an as-reported basis. 67% or $1.07 billion of our March quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. We are expecting another strong deferred revenue quarter, driving higher sales commissions as we complete our fiscal year. ", "In closing, we were pleased with our performance during the December quarter and will continue to focus on consistent execution, M&A integration and expense management. And now I'll turn it back to Helyn so that we can take some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs conference on February 16 and at the Morgan Stanley conference on March 1. We will be reporting our fiscal fourth quarter results on May 11. In addition, please save the dates for our Vision User Conference on May 3 and 4 and our Financial Analyst Day on May 26. More information regarding details and registration of these events will be distributed later in the quarter. For a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit our Events Calendar on the Investor Relations website. Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "And we'll take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "James, first question is for you. And I'm curious if deferred revenue was better than you expected, are you seeing a return to customers being more willing to buy longer-term contracts, longer-term maintenance contracts?", "James Beer", "No, we're not seeing any change in the structure of the buying, if you will. It's very much the same sort of customer environment as we've seen in the last year or year and a half or so. We've just been pleased by the overall volume of bookings driving through to the third.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So it's just more license with more maintenance that's just driving it, just better business volumes.", "Enrique Salem", "No, what's happening, John, is that we're also seeing as our cloud-based offerings are more service-based, they create deferred revenue. So our MSS business performed very well. We continued adoption of cloud-based services. And those, our more subscription-oriented, they go onto the balance sheet.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And just a follow-up, Enrique, more on the Storage Management, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that it was now stable and you've seen the last couple of quarters where it had been a tough business. I'm just curious, though, I would think that most of that business at this point is maintenance or maintenance-like. And I would assume -- I guess, how should we be thinking about that going forward? Would we assume that, that stability would continue? And perhaps, could we see any growth out of that? Or is there a reason that we could see that decline again?", "Enrique Salem", "I think what we did at Analyst Day is we gave you a range, kind of thinking about a three-year view that basically says that business is flat to slightly down. Now what we're seeing, though, is we've gotten new solutions like Application HA and VirtualStore that we co-developed with VMware that are helping customers think about how they continue to migrate more of their infrastructure to use virtualization. So they're taking that, a lot of customers tell me they're about 1/3 of the way, maybe 40% through virtualizing their servers. With these new technologies, they now can think about how do they go to those production applications and move them into the markets. So, I think that we're clearly seeing some benefit from the new technologies that we started shipping in the last quarter of 2010.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Enrique, just as I look at the Consumer business, and it's a nice performance that reflects your industry-leading products. But I also look back over this past year, you have a PC cycle that peaked about a year ago, and you're still seeing benefits from the Digital River insourcing that you've done, which sounds like it's been very successful for you. But, as you look out onto the horizon, the future of the Consumer business, what are the growth drivers that you'll be talking about a few quarters from now? And what will be the needs of modernization when we look at that business in the future, beyond just the traditional model of converting trialware on PCs?", "Enrique Salem", "As we think about the Consumer business, you heard me talk a little bit about our Norton Everywhere initiative. And so what we've got to do is absolutely go beyond the PC. What Janice and her team are doing is they're thinking about a whole range of new capabilities. You also heard me comment on some new consumer services, the notion of how do we help customers, in effect, clean up their PCs, stabilize their PCs. And so there's a series of service offerings that we're bringing to market. So, it's a combination of going beyond the PC and also delivering new service-based offerings. And so you can take a look at a number of those new services. We're starting to see some good performance from them and they're also good differentiators. So bottom line is you have got to go beyond the PC.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "When I look at the large deal metrics, they seem fairly strong. But Enrique, in the past, you've talked about SMB being a very large opportunity for Symantec, and particularly VS, and things that you could do in the channel. I was wondering if you could give us an update. When you think about the mix of the business, what are you seeing downmarket? And are there any metrics that you can put that?", "Enrique Salem", "As we look at the SMB segment, it still remains a very big opportunity. An interesting stat for you is that there are roughly in the range of about 25 million, 26 million companies that are below the 25-user range. And so what that means is you have got to be able to capitalize on that lower end of the SMB segment. And so that's an area that we see a good opportunity. The other thing that's happening that's important is our partners are saying we want to be able to become more of a managed service provider. And so we're moving our capabilities to be integrated with some of the other platforms that are currently available one the marketplace and obviously, looking at how do we leverage some of our existing technology. As far as metrics, what I would tell you is the two big products that are sold into that segment are our Endpoint Security and our Backup Exec. And so the benefits over time will show up in deferred revenue, that we're seeing some of it there already, and then over time translating into recognized revenue.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Enrique, James, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the Security business, which if I back out the SSL, it looks like it was about flat. And I know that you said DLP was strong. Just kind of want to get some more insight into what's going on in the core Endpoint and other businesses that contribute the majority of that business?", "Enrique Salem", "As you look at the Endpoint business, what we're doing there is we're continuing to simplify the offering and make sure that the low end of the market, as I just talked about in the previous question, doesn't have to install a full product. We're shipping new technologies, like Symantec Hosted Endpoint Protection, where we think that, that will be a nice driver for the SMB segment. If there was one spot where we've got to continue to work on improvement, I think it's in the SMB segment in EMEA, Europe, Middle East and Africa, where I think we're still a bit behind where we would like to be. And that's an area of opportunity for improvement.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "And then I guess probably for Enrique, you as well, just on the FileStore appliances and the strategy there, I know you have the option with Huawei coming up here in a week or so to take the majority ownership, and you're starting to ship those appliances more broadly and really go after a new market there. I'm wondering if you could maybe kind of give us a picture of what you're thinking about there. Is this a market you think will be -- or a product area you think will be much bigger for Symantec that you'll take on the joint venture and become more of a hardware vendor? Just some understanding on kind of the strategy there will be helpful.", "Enrique Salem", "When we entered the joint venture, we thought about three important things. One, appliance form factors becoming more important to our customers. Two, we wanted better access to the Chinese market. And three, our partner has a big presence in the network side of the telecommunications providers. The joint venture is doing very well. They were able to exceed their plan for the full calendar year 2010. And so at this point, those three things are still important to us. You heard me comment about appliances. You mentioned the FileStore appliance. And so what we're doing right now is we're in active discussions with Huawei about how do we want to proceed with the joint venture. But right now, the joint venture is performing well, and it's creating value. So, we're obviously very engaged in those conversations. And we don't have an update right now, but over the next several months, we'll be able to comment more about the disposition of the 2% or potentially a little bit more.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets.", "Michael Bauer", "This is actually Mike for Dan. Just another quick question on the core Enterprise Security business. Can you just speak maybe just one the deal trends? And have you seen anything different in the competitive environment now that with the McAfee acquisition basically almost completed now?", "Enrique Salem", "What we're seeing now is we're absolutely winning deals in large enterprise from McAfee. And at this point, they feel like they are a bit of disarray. I mean, we've had a lot of their sales people in Europe come talk to us. We've customers asking the question, \"Is McAfee going to get subsumed and become distracted?\" And so we see there's an opportunity. Now that deal should close here momentarily, and I think that's where you'll really see the opportunity for Symantec.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with ISI Group.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.", "Enrique, I was wondering if you could give a sense for the dilution that you're having on your GAAP margins this year as a result of the acquisitions. I know you mentioned that for the quarter you just ended. But, I'm trying to look ahead to next year, and assuming no other deals, how should we think about margins then stepping up from this dilution in fiscal '11 and fiscal '12. And then on top of that, at your Analyst Day back in May, you mentioned a GAAP margin target of 30% in fiscal '13. I'm just trying to get a sense for if you still feel comfortable with that.", "Enrique Salem", "Let me just give you a comment. Obviously, our goal in what we've been doing, Heather, is thinking about how do we grow the top line, but also we've got to continue to manage expenses. This quarter, we exceeded our deferred revenue about $200 million ahead of consensus, and that drove a bit higher commission expense. But ultimately, our goal is to continue to do a good job, an improving job of managing expenses. I'll let James comment as far as the dilution for next year from the current acquisitions.", "James Beer", "Well, it's a little early to be talking about the next fiscal year. But as I mentioned in my remarks, I would expect the PGP, GuardianEdge deals to be neutral to EPS even in the March quarter. And so, I would expect benefit in fiscal '12. And you see that same sort of trajectory around the VeriSign dilution as well. So, I would certainly be expecting to get to an increasing situation in fiscal '12. Ex the deferred revenue writedown, the deals are accretive already, again as I mentioned.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.", "I guess what I'm trying to get at is given the margins you just guided to, if there is a 200 basis point hit this year in fiscal '11, if you think that you can then progress if you were to normalize for that in fiscal '12. I'm just trying to get a sense for how should we think of margin progression, and then just the target that you guys threw out at Analyst Day, of 30%, if that still holds, so then we could kind of string things together a little bit for modeling purposes.", "James Beer", "Well, this is one of the reasons why we go to the level of detail, so that you can see each of the primary lines of the P&L, ex the deferred revenue haircut. So, we've given the operating margin and so forth on a more neutralized basis, if you will. And as Enrique said, we'll continue to manage expenses in FY '12 very tightly. Again, as was the case in fiscal '11, we're looking to drive efficiencies in the traditional parts of the business in order to be able to put the right level of spending into the new areas of growth for the future. So, I would expect as we continue on through this FY '12 planning season that we're very much in the middle of right now that, that will continue to be the emphasis.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "I had a follow-up about margins and specifically, the consumer margins. It looks like over the last couple of quarters, margins are stabilizing in the mid-40s. And I wanted to understand, I guess, first of all, is that an accurate statement? Do you feel like we've seen stabilization in the consumer margins? And to what extent would you expect the deceleration in the consumer PC market to potentially actually put upward pressure on those margins over the next 12 to 18 months?", "James Beer", "Well, I think you're right, Adam, in characterizing the consumer margins as having stabilized thus far in fiscal '11 versus the situation in fiscal '10. And I would expect that, that, too, will be what continues in the fourth quarter. And again, a little early to look beyond into fiscal '12, but we're pleased with that stabilization that we've seen in the margins this year.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "And then if I could just drill down on the large deal activity, you had very good activity in sort of the medium-sized large deals and the larger deals. Now there's seasonality obviously in December. As you look in the pipe to your fiscal fourth quarter, do you see the same kind of mix relative to the larger deals? And from a product perspective, what's driving that? Is it more bundling? Is it bigger average deal sizes across a number of products? What's the driver there?", "Enrique Salem", "What I would tell, Adam, is very specifically, we're seeing that people are buying more of the portfolio. I think James commented about 77% of the deals had multiple products. And that's been one of the areas we've been pushing on pretty hard because when we do some of the analysis in our customer base, a lot of them, especially as you look at the Enterprise segment, which is below the largest companies, they have one, maybe two products. So, the ability to cross sell the portfolio is absolutely helping us. The other thing that's happening is customers are still not pre-buying the out years, years two and three, as they've done in the past. And so that's why we're getting the cluster of deals in that $300,000 and $500,000 range. But it's absolutely the benefit of our portfolio and the ability to cross sell.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "Enrique, just on the deferred revenue, you're seeing deferred revenue growth that you haven't seen for quite some time. I guess, can you just give us what signs you're seeing that's giving you confidence that this is a sustainable trend versus just a snapback off of easy comps? Is there anything that's giving you more confidence that we're actually in a better spending cycle for a longer period versus just a quick snap?", "Enrique Salem", "What you want to look at is there's a couple of trends that are favoring or moving us to a more ratable or deferred revenue model. First, as we go to cloud-based services, if you look at MSS doing well, hosted services. And in hosted services, not just hosted messaging security, but you also have our trust services or SSL business, which is also a deferred revenue or ratable revenue recognition. So you've got a move to cloud-based services that's going to move to more of a subscription. I think the second part of it is, absolutely are seeing the good momentum in a number of different product lines that continue to drive that deferred revenue balance. And so, my sense is the biggest driver is the move to hosted or subscription-based products that will become ratable instead of license maintenance.", "James Beer", "The only thing I would add to that is that when you look at the history of our deferred revenue growth on a constant currency basis, both of the previous two December quarters saw growth of 3% year-over-year, even though the economic environment was clearly a very tough one in both of those periods. So, we're seeing robust growth of really reasonable basis in deferred revenue.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "And just a quick follow up, what percent of the revenue do you think could be hosted in a couple of years as a percent in the overall revenue?", "Enrique Salem", "I haven't done a recent calculation for a 12-month period, but again, we are seeing good momentum across the MSS business, the hosted services and the VeriSign trust services.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "James, maybe can you talk to us about a little bit as you look at the strong bookings numbers, great deferred revenue strength, your guidance in deferred revenue, how should we think about that flowing through in terms of revenue model, maybe one or two quarters out? I mean, clearly, it looks clearly like bookings/deferred revenue are going to lead here. How should we think about the delay factor in terms of coming into the revenue model in terms of putting up double-digit growth?", "James Beer", "Well, if you take out deferred revenue balance, you can think of it flowing into the P&L over a 12- to 18-month period. And that's probably the good rule of thumb to be applying.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "That far out, 12 to 18 months?", "James Beer", "Yes. I mean, obviously, it depends on the mix of what's making up that deferred revenue at any particular point in time. But, it's a tail there, it's clearly not a straight-line function. But, over the next 12 to 18 months, it's generally where we see the balance of any point in time fully into the P&L.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And maybe, Enrique, as you look at the joint venture, clearly, it seems to be benefiting you both, each party, is there any way to kind of strategically unlock some shareholder value here? Or how do you kind of look at that as you approach the board?", "Enrique Salem", "As I talk to the board, it's really continuing to execute against the priorities that we set for the business. We actually believe China is becoming more and more important going forward, and so that joint venture gives us a significant presence. I was in China in early December, and just the ability to have the largest tech company in China, basically, as your partner gives you a nice halo effect. And so, what we talk about is how are we doing against the strategic objectives of the joint venture? And what I'm happy to report on is across the three we outlined, we are doing exactly what we expected. And so, at this point, the joint venture, as it grows its revenue, is creating value and we expect to continue on that trajectory. So our goal is to work with Huawei right now to figure what is the best path forward for the joint venture with us and Huawei being its parents.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "If you look at the Consumer business, clearly, you talked about the data storage portion of it, and you gave some anecdotal evidence of the growth there. I mean, can you talk to us about how do we think about the additional services and the move to Norton 360 and the additional services versus kind of like this whole tablet phenomenon? Help us kind of think about the investor phenomenon, where you're offering a more service-orientated architectures opportunity for them versus this kind of declining PC environment to kind of help investors think about that?", "Enrique Salem", "Well, what we're doing is we're absolutely on a strategy, both for the Consumer and Enterprise business that is device-independent. We feel that we need to deliver capabilities on any device anywhere, anytime. And that's what Janice outlined for the Consumer business at the last Analyst Day. She talked about it under the Norton Everywhere title. And what we'll definitely do is continue to move in that direction. And what you should expect is over the next six to nine months, we'll continue to extend the capabilities across platforms. But today, with Norton Connect, you're already able to access the content that's being backed up using Norton 360 from your iPhone, from your Android device. And so, at this point, what we're doing is going to extend the capabilities so on any device, you'll be able to take advantage of the information you may be creating or using from your PC. So, the important notion here that customers are telling us is tablets and mobile devices are companion devices, not necessarily replacement. So, what we expect, while we may not see the same level of growth in the PC market, we do still expect growth in PCs. But then the ability to be across all of the devices is what becomes more important going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I want to follow up on the closure of the McAfee deal. Enrique said very specifically that would help you. Are you running programs to convert customers once that deal is closing? And how many people do you expect to hire from McAfee?", "Enrique Salem", "I don't think we have a target as far as who we're going to hire. We're just saying that there is some level of interest in people to leave that organization. And so, our expectation is that, that will continue to create some disruption. As far as targeted programs, it's a competitive environment and we're always looking at ways to continue to gain share in the Security business until we've had a number of different programs, and we're obviously going to continue those programs as we move forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Neil Herman with Soleil Securities.", "Neil Herman - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Obviously, you showed a 12% growth in your deferred revenue line. Could you give us a sense from a longer-term perspective if we assume that the IT spending environment remains fairly stable and the overall economic environment remains fairly stable? Could you kind of give us a sense as to your longer-term growth objectives from a top line perspective over the next couple of years?,", "Enrique Salem", "As we look at it in the last Analyst Day, we talked about the portfolio, right? We have a portfolio of capabilities, and I don't think I'm going to change anything that James talked about. And so, as we think about it, it's absolutely -- we believe it's a mid-single-digits number that we are targeting right now. And the environment continues to improve from here. There'll be opportunities because from our perspective, we've got a fantastic portfolio, and it's getting better. But a lot of it, as you say Neil, is driven by what's happening in the overall IT environment.", "Neil Herman - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "And then I was wondering if you feel like you're through the drag associated with the end of the Oracle relationship? Or is that still somewhat of a continuing drag for you?", "Enrique Salem", "On specifically, the drag, we definitely feel that there's a little bit more to that pail. There's probably another six months or so left, where the Oracle deal is a bit of a drag. But, then we have new things, other partners, who are doing very well with that business, specifically HP and Linux or Red Hat, were showing real clear improvements. And then the big opportunity is clearly around VMware with some of the new capabilities around AppHA and VirtualStore.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just want to focus in [ph] on your Enterprise business a bit. License revenue was only down, I think, of about 3% year-over-year, which has definitely been an improvement sort of each quarter over the past few quarters here. How much of that is just sort of the stabilization for the Oracle and the Storage Foundation business versus how much do you think you're seeing sort of just an improvement or stabilization in the sales force efficiency? And Enrique, what are the steps you think or, I guess, the milestones you look for that will start to turn that positive?", "Enrique Salem", "So Phil, you're right to say the headwind that we faced in the transition of Sun and the slowing of the Solaris platform has been a factor. And then you touched on the other side of it, which is sales force execution. I think that the combination of the product portfolio, we've got a lot of demand for products like DLP for products like NetBackup, and we've got a focused sales force. So that combination is what's driving the improvement. There's still more work to do, but I'm very pleased with how our sales force performed around the world. Usually, I'll talk about one region did well or another, but what I saw was consistent execution across the sales force across the world. And my expectation is that, that will continue into the March quarter and beyond.", "James Beer", "Yes. And I'd just further add that while the Sun-Oracle OEM contract certainly had an impact year-over-year on license revenue, and we would expect that to continue on for the next two or three quarters year-over-year, we saw very nice traction around products like NetBackup, Backup Exec, our Archiving products as well. And those are big drivers of license revenue.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Philip Rueppel with Wells Fargo.", "Philip Rueppel", "A couple of clarifications. First of all, on the Enterprise business, the strength there, did you see the sales cycles contract? And if so, was that kind of a calendar year-end phenomenon? Or given your commentary about expected strength in bookings, is that something that's likely to continue and/or is that sort of a new normal?", "Enrique Salem", "I would tell you I didn't see a change in sales cycles. I think we had a robust pipeline going into the quarter, and we saw a good deal closure, but nothing different than we expected. As far as new normal, I think we've got good sales force execution right now. Team is doing very well, products are doing well, and so I expect that to continue into March and beyond.", "Philip Rueppel", "And then finally, a follow-up, of the three strategic priorities going forward, the mobile or the Norton Everywhere, is probably the less-developed but potentially has the biggest opportunity. You mentioned sort of six to nine months. Is that a timeframe where we could start to see meaningful bookings and some of these early wins start to become widely deployed? Or is it something that is going to take the better part of a year or two?", "Enrique Salem", "I think it will take -- it's a multi-year effort as this move to mobility continues to increase, and businesses and consumers think about what they need to do on those devices. Because it's not just a security play. One of the categories is how do you manage those devices. So it's a combination of management and security. When I mentioned six to nine months, you'll expect to hear more, for example, at the Barcelona World Congress. You'll hear some of the thoughts that we've got around new partnerships and new capabilities, expect to hear at Analyst Day later in May, specifically about some of the new initiatives. And so that's what I'm referencing in the six to nine months. But as far as the revenue and having a big impact on our total business, it will take a little bit longer.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Enrique Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique Salem", "Thanks, operator. Well, I'm pleased with the team's execution in our better-than-expected December quarter results. I'm optimistic about our prospects for the March quarter, and so I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. And I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relation. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter, James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release, and then, Enrique will discuss our focus areas for fiscal year 2012. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website at symantec.com/invest. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year, constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For the March quarter 2011, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.37 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.41 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.35 per euro. For the March 2010 quarter, the actual weighted rate was $1.38 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.35 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information, which are available on the website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique Salem", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third consecutive quarter of strong results. Bookings grew double digits again this quarter, resulting in record revenue and deferred revenue. Our performance was driven by market share gains as well as strength in Backup, SaaS, Data Loss Prevention and Consumer. In addition, our recently acquired businesses once again exceeded expectations and delivered strong results. ", "Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. The Consumer business delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to acquire and retain more customers given the strength of our product releases and the ongoing development of our e-commerce capabilities. Our new e-store enables us to upsell and cross sell more of our products and services. During the quarter, we successfully launched Norton 360 Version 5, which has received over 95 positive reviews and awards to date. Norton 360 now includes enhanced PC tuneup, along with access to features such as the Norton Cyber Crime Index, Norton Online Family and Norton Safe Web. Over the past several years, we've expanded our consumer offerings to address the evolving needs of users. We now offer several solutions beyond traditional security, such as live services, online backup and online safety services. Norton Online Family achieved a milestone, with over 1 million registered families worldwide. These new offerings contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for the Consumer business this quarter and accounted for 4% of total consumer revenue. We expanded distribution of our free Norton PC Checkup and Norton Security Scan services to include partners such as PcDrivers and the Ask Partner Network. Many consumers who take advantage of these solutions are not using traditional Norton products. This gives us the opportunity to expand the value we bring to these customers by introducing them to our full line of security suites and other services. We also expanded distribution of our traditional Norton products into alternative channels such as D-Link, Webster Bank, M&T back and TechAmerica. We continue to see opportunities beyond the PC through our Norton Everywhere initiative. We are offering Norton Mobile Security to customers around the globe through our broad multichannel distribution network. Recent partner wins include carriers such as T-Mobile Austria and KDDI, retailers such as Dixons and OEMs such as Samsung through its app store. All of these parters have chosen to include Norton Mobile Security, along with their Android phone and tablet offerings. A beta version of our mobile security offering is available in the Android market, allowing us to get valuable direct feedback from an increasing number of end users. While early days, I am pleased with the inroads we are making in providing customers a hassle-free online experience across mobile phones, tablets and smart devices. ", "Now I'll turn to our Enterprise business. I'm very pleased with the sales team's execution this quarter. Our disciplined account management and focused initiatives for selling across our portfolio have had a positive impact on our sales activity. During the quarter, 7 of our 13 transactions over $10 million included sales from our Security, Backup and Storage businesses. We signed multiyear agreements with 2 of the world's largest financial institutions for deployment of our Storage Foundation, NetBackup and Data Loss Prevention products. I'm also pleased with the sales team's ability to cross sell our encryption solutions with our security products into various customer segments and verticals. A U.S. services company signed a multi-million dollar contract which includes Control Compliance Suite, encryption, user authentication and data loss prevention. ", "Moving on to our Backup and Archiving business, our recently refreshed backup portfolio further differentiates us from the competition and is driving growth for this business. By integrating deduplication, archiving and virtualization support features into these products, we have made it easier for customers to adopt and standardize on our solutions. Customers value our ability to improve storage efficiency and increase infrastructure utilization as well as reduce their total cost of ownership. NetBackup, the number one information management solution for the enterprise, posted strong double-digit bookings growth and we are gaining share. This was driven by the rapid adoption of deduplication and demand for virtual machine protection. The team closed the largest transaction in NetBackup's history. We continue to beat the competition worldwide. Our capacity base pricing is helping us to capitalize on the unprecedented rate of information growth and providing customers with a simpler way to deploy, manage and track licenses. For the March quarter, 36% of new license bookings for NetBackup utilized this model. Earlier this year, we launched the industry's only backup and deduplication appliance. We are seeing strong customer adoption of our all-in-one hardware and software solution. ", "In the mid-market, Backup Exec delivered another quarter of strong results. We are seeing continued adoption of Backup Exec 2010, which has been one of our strongest backup releases to date. Small and medium-sized businesses are benefiting from simplified information management through integrated deduplication and virtual machine protection. We continue to maintain a strong lead over our competition. We are expanding Backup Exec into new delivery models with Backup Exec.cloud, a SaaS offering and a new mid-market backup appliance. We expect both of these offerings to be released later this year. ", "Last week, we announced V-Ray, which extends our information management leadership in virtualized environments. Due to a lack of visibility, customers leaving virtual machines unprotected as they're finding it difficult to manage, recover and dedup information. Our internally developed technology provides organizations with complete visibility into virtual and physical backup images, simplifies recovery and ensures that all machines are protected. It guarantees continuous data protection as well as maximizes return on investment from server virtualization. Given V-Ray's great value proposition and positive customer feedback, we are confident it will further differentiate our backup products from the competition. Our market-leading archive product, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit bookings growth driven by strong e-Discovery revenue. Customers are dealing with unprecedented growth in unstructured information, making it difficult to capture, categorize and index key information. Enterprise Vault helps customers simplify information management as well as enforce retention policies. Last week, we announced Enterprise Vault 10.0, which is scheduled to be available in the second half of 2011. Enterprise Vault 10 will bring together the breadth of our security and backup portfolio by integrating our archiving capability with data loss prevention, encryption and mail security. This allows us to deliver content aware classification, giving customers the ability to automatically discard irrelevant data. I'm pleased with the progress we're making in helping our customers migrate to Symantec's next-generation information management solutions. ", "In our Enterprise Security business, we continue to do well in the enterprise and large enterprise segments. Strong results were led by DLP, which saw revenue nearly double this quarter. Our DLP solution continues to shift the focus of security to protecting information, not just infrastructure. CISOs across all industries appreciate our ability to solve the security challenges they're facing as information continues to grow and threats become more targeted and more sophisticated. This has resulted in larger security transactions that include information protection solutions, as well as our endpoint security, management and compliance suites. We're making progress in the SMB security market by focusing on the unique needs of customers and partners in this segment. We plan to release the next version of Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition later this year. We're building on the successes realized in other parts of our businesses to enhance our enterprise products and service offerings. We're taking consumer success in providing the fastest, lightest and most effective protection capabilities and delivering a similar feature set that addresses the need of small businesses. In addition, we've implemented an extensive beta program as part of our commitment to quality, given it is one of the key processes that made the launch of our backup products so successful. I'm encouraged with the progress the development team is making on this key release and the diligence of our channel sales team in preparing and educating partners as well expanding participation in our SMB partner specialization program. ", "Our SaaS offerings, known as Symantec.cloud, are leading the way to deliver security and management services from the cloud. SaaS realized healthy bookings growth in the quarter. Bookings in the Americas and APJ were particularly strong as we continue to expand our footprint outside of EMEA. We increased cross selling of our e-mail, archiving, Web and endpoint security SaaS solutions into the large enterprise install base. We now offer 16 SaaS solutions globally. We're helping customers gain visibility and control their information and applications there in the cloud. We've partnered with Salesforce.com to launch Symantec Security Assessment for Salesforce. This new security application is designed to help organizations to extend the visibility of their IT infrastructure to include cloud-based applications and is scheduled to be available on Salesforce's AppExchange. We also plan to integrate this new security application with our Control Compliance Suite to provide customers a single view across information and applications that reside on premise and in the cloud. In addition, we realized another quarter of double-digit bookings growth in Managed Security Services. ", "Cardinal Health, a Fortune 20 company, chose to implement our services to drive efficient and effective IT security management. Customers value our expertise in providing realtime global protection from increasingly sophisticated and complex threats. Our acquisitions exceeded expectations on all metrics as the team executed against our plans to integrate and grow these businesses. ", "The SSL business posted its largest booking quarter ever and grew the installed base double digits in both the premium and value segments. We continue to tie our encryption offerings to our DLP sales as customers increasingly look to solve their information protection challenges in a more holistic way. The progress we've made in effectively integrating acquired technologies and leveraging our sales force and partner network are making a difference. I'm pleased with the team's ability to act quickly and streamline operational integration. ", "In conclusion, we've closed the year on a strong note driven by the strength of our industry-leading products and technologies. We started the fiscal year with a clear set of priorities and as I look back over the year, I'm proud of what we've accomplished. Our Consumer, Backup, SaaS and Data Loss Prevention businesses are performing well, and I'm pleased with the stabilization in the Storage Management business. We've made great strides in effectively integrating our acquisitions and leveraging our distribution network to successfully grow these businesses. I'm confident that we've laid the foundation for a strong fiscal year 2012. And now I'll turn it over to James for a review of our financial results.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. We posted better-than-expected fourth quarter results for each of our key financial metrics driven by solid bookings across all segments and geographies. Our record revenue and deferred revenue were as a result of strength in our Backup, Consumer, Data Loss Prevention and Software as a Service offerings as well as continued strong execution by our recently acquired businesses. ", "First, I'll review the financial results of our fiscal year 2011. GAAP revenue totaled $6.19 billion, up 4% in constant currency from the previous year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.8% was down 280 basis points from the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.42, down 5% year-over-year as reported. Excluding the purchase accounting related to deferred revenue write-down of $165 million from our 3 acquisitions, non-GAAP operating margin would have been 26.8%, down 90 basis points from the previous year and non-GAAP earnings per share would have totaled $1.58, up 6% year-over-year as reported. The year-over-year margin decline reflects the growth of our lower margin emerging businesses and increased enterprise commissions costs associated with significantly higher fourth quarter bookings that will be reflected in our revenue during the coming quarters. As a result of our strong bookings performance, we closed the year with a record $3.82 billion in GAAP deferred revenue, up 16% year-over-year and generated $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations, up 6% year-over-year as reported. Capital expenditure totaled $268 million. ", "Now I'll review the financial details of the March quarter. GAAP revenue totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of 8% versus the March 2010 period. Excluding the deferred revenue write-down, revenue growth would have been 11%. License revenue grew 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in our backup and DLP businesses. This is the first quarter of year-over-year license growth since September 2008. Content, subscription and maintenance revenues continued to grow steadily, increasing 7% year-over-year. Subscription sales from our consumer, Software as a Service and authentication solutions accounted for approximately 37% of total revenue, up from 34% in the year-ago period. The U.S. dollar strengthened 1% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period. Towards the end of the quarter, however, the U.S. dollar weakened significantly against the yen, increasing our international revenue as measured in U.S. dollars. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point year-over-year and approximately half a percentage point sequentially. ", "The tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%, below our guidance of 27%, primarily due to a one-time offshore tax benefit associated with the Veritas tax assessment for 2000 and 2001. Net income of $297 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38. Relative to our guidance expectations, we generated $0.09 of EPS benefit from better-than-expected revenue, lower OEM placement fees and one-time tax benefits. These benefits were offset by 6% of EPS dilution, driven primarily by higher-than-expected sales commissions, given the strong bookings and deferred revenue generated in the quarter. Excluding the deferred revenue write-down of $50 million from our recent acquisitions, EPS would have been $0.05 higher at $0.43, up 8% year-over-year as reported. ", "The Consumer business generated revenue of $514 million, up 5% year-over-year, driven by improving renewal rates, upselling customers to our premium suites and cross selling customers to our new service offerings. GAAP operating margin for our Consumer segment was 47% as compared to 44% in the March 2010 quarter. Consumer operating margins stabilized over the course of the year as expected. ", "Turning now to the Enterprise business, our sales execution continued to improve this past quarter. We closed a total of 489 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 32% year-over-year. 120 of these transactions generated more than $1 million, up 38% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $1 million, 46% included sales from both our Security and Storage segments. In the $300,000 and greater deal size category, the number of transactions involving both security and storage increased by 137% year-over-year. We generated 13 transactions valued at more than $10 million as compared to three such transactions in the March 2010 quarter as we were successful in selling the value inherent in the breadth of our security, backup and storage management portfolio. ", "The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $626 million, an increase of 7% as compared to the March 2010 quarter. Revenue from our Backup and Archiving business increased 16% year-over-year, driven by our differentiated deduplication and virtual machine protection features. Revenue from our Storage Management business decreased 7% year-over-year as a result of weak bookings performance in the first half of fiscal year '11. However, I'm pleased that we recorded our second consecutive quarter of stable year-over-year bookings in the Storage Management business. GAAP operating margin for our Storage and Server Management segment was 44% as compared to 47% in the March 2010 quarter, driven by higher sales commissions resulting from strong deferred revenue growth during the quarter. ", "The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $446 million, up 21% year-over-year, driven by strength in DLP, Software as a Service and authentication services. Total revenue for the 3 encryption and authentication businesses we acquired in fiscal year 2011 was $81 million compared to our expectations of $70 million. The VeriSign Security business performed better than expected, generating revenue of $61 million, while PGP and GuardianEdge posted revenue of $20 million, also beating our expectations. The combined EPS dilution from these acquisitions was $0.015, $0.005 less dilutive than our expectation of $0.02. GAAP operating margin for our Security and Compliance segment was 13% as compared to 28% in the March 2010 quarter, driven by increased expenses from our 3 acquisitions and higher sales commissions. Excluding the deferred revenue write-down, the Security and Compliance operating margin would have totaled 22%. ", "Our Services business generated revenue of $87 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 7% as compared to 11% in the March 2010 quarter. ", "Turning now to total company margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 85.8% for the March 2011 quarter, up 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.1%, down 390 basis points compared to the March 2010 quarter, primarily driven by our acquisitions and higher commission expenses. Excluding the effects of the acquired deferred revenue write-down, our operating margin for the March quarter would have been 26.4%. We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $689 million. We exited the March quarter with $2.96 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, with approximately 46% of our cash balance in the U.S. During the quarter, we spent $180 million to repurchase approximately 11 million shares at an average price of $17.86. ", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the June 2011 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.42 per euro versus the weighted average and end-of-period rate of $1.26 per euro from the June 2010 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate before consideration of any loss from our joint venture of 27% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 765 million shares. Our CSE guidance does not include the potential for an increase in the share count associated with our convertible notes in the event that our average stock price is at or above $19.12 for the quarter. Thus, for the June 2011 quarter, we expect GAAP deferred revenue to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.59 billion as compared to revenue of $1.43 billion during June 2010. We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 10% to 11% on an as-reported basis. The VeriSign Security business is expected to contribute $70 million to our June quarter revenue. ", "As a reminder, we will complete a full year of operations for PGP and GuardianEdge in the June quarter, and as such, we will no longer be breaking out guidance for these businesses. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.19 and $0.20 as compared to $0.20 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 and $0.37 as compared to $0.35 in the year-ago period. We expect $0.01 of dilution as a result of our VeriSign acquisition. Including $30 million of deferred revenue write-down amortization for the June quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would be higher by approximately $0.02 and would be expected to be between $0.38 and $0.39. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.6 billion and $3.63 billion compared to $3 billion at the end of June 2010. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 20% to 21% on an as-reported basis. 72% or $1.14 billion of our June quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. Also, in the June quarter, we expect to repay the remaining $600 million of our 2011 convertible notes from our domestic cash balance. ", "In conclusion, we were pleased with our strong bookings performance at our fiscal year end. We will continue to focus on consistent execution and managing our expenses judiciously to drive top line growth in the coming fiscal year. And now I'll turn it back to Enrique.", "Enrique Salem", "Thank you, James. I'd now like to take a moment to discuss our focus areas for this fiscal year. This year, we will build on the progress we made in 2011. It's clear that a handful of key trends are transforming the industry and having a profound impact on both consumers and enterprises. Customers are looking for ways to build and use the cloud to improve efficiency. They also want to virtualize their environments to save money and they want to enable the use of personal mobile technology in the workplace to enhance productivity. Meanwhile, information continues to grow exponentially and threats are becoming more sophisticated and more targeted. This year, we will execute on our vision and strategy by delivering solutions at all customers to confidently adopt cloud, virtualization and mobile technologies. We'll also focus on energizing our core businesses by helping customers deal with the challenges of rapid information growth and new, more targeted and sophisticated threats. We will pay particular attention to the SMB market across both of these priorities, tailing more of our solutions and go-to-market efforts to unique needs of the SMB customer. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our upcoming financial analyst day. And with that, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, Enrique. Ruthie, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We will be hosting our financial analyst day on Thursday, May 26 in New York. Please note that registration is required to attend the event. In addition, we will be presenting at the JPMorgan Conference on May 16 and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Conference on June 2. Lastly, we will be reporting our fiscal first quarter results on July 27. For a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit our Events Calendar on the IR website. Ruthie, we are ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "James, in regard to your prepared remarks and comments on sales and marketing expense in the quarter, you talked about lower margin emerging markets -- strong performance in emerging markets, which are of the lower margin, and you also talked about bookings outperformance and accelerators in your enterprise comp plans. First off, can you just explain to us a little bit about the emerging markets and why it is that the business there has a higher cost of sale? And also, as it relates to the comp plans, can you maybe talk a little bit about how they may have changed going into this year? Are the accelerators any different? And should we expect to see any more leverage out of them?", "James Beer", "Well, with regards to the first point, the remarks I made earlier was around our emerging businesses rather than the emerging markets per se. So I was talking about things such as our Hosted Services business, our Appliances business, that sort of thing. We're pleased with the growth opportunities that we're seeing and that we foresee for the future here. But certainly, as we work to scale those businesses, we're seeing lower margins for those segments than for the corporate average, if you will. So as those businesses scale, I think the margin contribution from them will improve. Appliances as well, probably structurally, are lower margin part of the overall products set but a very important part of the future.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And on the comp plans, are we going to see any more leverage out of them in 2012?", "James Beer", "We haven't made significant changes to the comp plan in 2012. We were pleased with the bookings performance that we got there in fiscal '11. And we're going to continue to obviously focus our sales team on driving that sort of top line performance. Certainly, we did see higher expenses during the fourth quarter because of commissions than we were originally expected when we offered our guidance. Of course, you have to accrue the full amount of the expenses associated with the fourth quarter bookings. But of course, you only get partial benefit in the P&L because many of those commissions are associated with dollars that are now registered as deferred revenue. And we'll get the benefit from that over the coming several quarters.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And just if I can follow-up with one last one. Enrique, appliances out of vision were a very hot topic last week from the NetBackup appliance, FileStore and your announcement of the Backup Exec appliance. Can you just comment a little bit more about what they're contributing today, what are the take rates from customers and how can you see this expanding and applying across the whole portfolio?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes. As we close the fiscal year, we saw a strong performance by the NetBackup appliances in particular and the deduplication capabilities. I expect that to continue. Everything I'm seeing initially in this quarter already says that, that was not a one-time phenomenon. The customers clearly see the benefit of the integrated software, hardware solution in one integrated device. It speeds up deployment, it simplifies deployment. And so I expect that to continue, and I think that we're going to see a real positive boost to our Backup and Deduplication business in particular as a result of these appliances.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question today from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "I'm wondering -- it was pretty well-publicized during the March quarter that the PC environment weakened quite a bit even as the quarter progressed. I wonder if you can just talk through, Enrique and James, what impact you saw on your business there from a weakening consumer PC environment. And sort of how do you look at growth in the Consumer business in light of what looks like still a pretty stagnant PC environment here in the June quarter?", "Enrique Salem", "What you continue to see is there's a number of things we put in place to do a much better job of monetizing new customers and the existing base given our ability to more effectively target customers, given the eCommerce capabilities plus our ability to cross sell more of the portfolio is clearly continuing to benefit the business as you saw 5% growth year-over-year. The other thing I touched on was that the new services accounted for 1% of the growth. So this is things that we recently introduced like our Norton live services where we're trying to make it much simpler for PC users to manage, control and use their PCs. And so what we're seeing is while, yes, you're right, there's definitely a softening in overall PC sales, our ability to more effectively deliver these new services is absolutely a benefit. The other comment I would make is as we look at the new platforms, Android devices, IOS devices, tablets. We are now very focused on taking our consumer products beyond our traditional PC market and we have had a lot of success starting to get some of these new capabilities into the marketplace. And so my expectation is over the next 12 to 24 months, you'll start seeing some of these new mobile capabilities start becoming a more meaningful contributor to the overall Consumer business.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "And then, James, just a follow-up on that with regard to expenses. I know that a lot of the PC OEM costs come out on shipment and it seems like with PC OEM shipments actually down year-over-year that you might have seen a decline in payments out there. I'm just curious if you can give us a little bit of a finer point on what you saw from an expense impact on the dynamic we're discussing here?", "James Beer", "Yes, versus when we offered guidance for the quarter, we saw OEM fees come in lower to the tune of about $0.01 worth of EPS.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Enrique, it looks like the Storage and Server business has churned, at least it's been struggling for a while. I know NetBackup and Backup Exec have been doing well but the rest of the storage, including Storage Foundation. I was just curious, how much of that is resulting from a renewed focus by Oracle on the Solaris platform? Because I believe that it's still something like half of Storage Foundation's on Solaris versus continued traction with the backup products and the product cycles you're seeing there.", "Enrique Salem", "Absolutely, our backup products saw a double-digit growth in the period, which we're very pleased with. What you see in the Storage Foundation high availability area is we're being more effective in non-Sun platforms. I mean HP is contributing more to the overall business. Linux, Red Hat, in particular, is contributing more to the overall health of the business, plus, we're bringing on new solutions. You heard comments around a little bit of what's happening with VMware, around AppHA and our Application High Availability technology. And so clearly, while we've seen some stabilization in the Sun-Oracle platform, it's really what's happening on the other platforms, Linux, HP-UX, AIX and then obviously some of the new solutions.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And, James, a follow-up to Brad's question. You pointed out the margin impact on paying commissions for those large enterprise bookings upfront and that's totally understandable, and that'll be recognized as we go along in the future, but the expense or at least the big expense, sales expense, that's already been incurred. I would expect to see margin expansion or margin improvement next year at least in this business. Is that a fair conclusion?", "James Beer", "Well, we would expect to grow both top line and our margins over the next couple of years or so. And we'll, in fact, give you an update on this at analyst day in a couple of weeks time. But I think part of what we're seeing around margins and their trajectory is that we do have more opportunities we believe now for growth of these emerging businesses that I was referring to, appliances, hosted and so forth, several others. And so those will tend to put a little pressure on the core for our operating margin while at the same time we look to drive productivity in the core of the business. So it'll be a variety of those types of effects that will allow us, at the end of the day, to continue to build operating margins.", "John DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So the net of that should be some improvement in operating margin?", "James Beer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question, we'll go to Heather Bellini with ISI Group.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.", "Just a follow-up, I guess, on the operating expense question that you've been getting asked about. I guess, my question is, as operating expenses are a little bit higher, and I know a lot of that has to do with the outperformance on the bookings line, should we start thinking that you feel confident that based on your past comments that top line growth should start to accelerate back to the target levels that maybe you guys had thought about in the past so that some of this OpEx reinvestment is actually going to generate faster revenue growth than what we've seen of late?", "James Beer", "Well, certainly, I think, as we've shown with the guidance for the June quarter, we're looking at a range that's in essence up 10% to 11% year-over-year. So that's, I think, pretty clear signal as to what you're talking about there.", "Heather Bellini - ISI Group Inc.", "And then the last question would be, and I apologize if you answered this, is the worst behind us now from the Sun acquisition with Oracle acquisition...", "James Beer", "Yes. I think just in terms of the impact of the OEM relationship with Sun-Oracle, clearly as each quarter goes by, the year-over-year effect is getting less so. Now I would expect there's still to be a material effect year-over-year on the SS&G group. It's business over the next couple of quarters, June and September quarter, after that, we really start to see the year-over-year effect to be very small. And the other thing I'd say is, of course, around that OEM relationship, the license sales have really almost gone to zero at this point, whereas the maintenance sales are stickier as you would expect.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "James, I'm wondering if you can talk to us about the backlog or maybe Enrique, talk about the backlog and visibility. Clearly deferred revenue was very strong. You talked about 72% of next quarter is going to roll off the balance sheet. I think that's probably near an all-time high. I'm wondering if you kind of put that in context relative to the pipeline and the visibility you have.", "Enrique Salem", "Let me comment on the visibility in the pipeline. I mean, we are definitely seeing continued confidence in the IT buying segment, meaning that IT buyers are feeling like there's a number of things that they need to sort of catch up on specifically as they think through migration to new versions of Windows, the increased growth in storage. And so there's some pent-up demand that I think we're benefiting from, and I expect that to continue. Now it's clear this is our first fiscal quarter of the new year and so I'm confident, I'm comfortable with the guidance that we have put out for revenue and EPS this quarter and that takes into account the improving visibility that we do have. As far as the deferred, James, you want to make a comment on the 72%?", "James Beer", "Yes, and I think it's illustrative of how subscription sales are becoming a more important component of the overall picture. I commented in my script about how those sales now were up 37% of total revenue, up from 34% a year ago. And that's very much showing the continued growth around Consumer, Hosted, on the Software as a Service side and areas of the business like Managed Security Services, and I would expect those parts of the business to continue to grow. So I would expect subscriptions to continue to grow as a proportion of the total.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Any kind of long-term target on where you think those could be, James? Do you think 12 to 24 months, we could see kind of that continued 300 basis improvement or is that too aggressive at this point?", "James Beer", "I don't have a specific target to share with you this afternoon. But I think, yes, a continued extrapolation approximately is a reasonable benchmark.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions around the Storage and Backup business. Is any of the strength you see in that business people starting to go back to more forward buying on the storage side and where do you think we are in what has obviously been a very strong product cycle on both the Backup Exec and the NetBackup side?", "Enrique Salem", "What we're seeing is pretty clearly driven by just the growth in the volume of data. And we did the largest NetBackup deal ever. And that's just customers saying they need to continue to rethink how they protect their data, and that's happening broadly. I mean, a lot of the big deals that we did had a NetBackup component. And as people adopt virtualization, as the data grows, they need our help and as the clear market leader, we're seeing some good benefits there. As far as where we are in the refresh cycle, you're absolutely right. I mean, we shipped brand new versions of NetBackup and Backup Exec about a year ago and customers are continuing to move to those solutions. The other thing, though, that was commented on is this notion of the backup appliances. I think what we're doing with the appliances given our strong position on the software side, integrating that with the hardware side, customer see a very clear benefit. What they see is Symantec's the market leader in backup from a software perspective. We're now delivering a appliance form factor, which is the best of both worlds that they can get from us, and so that's a real benefit. I think we're going to continue to see strength in our Data Protection business, that includes archiving. And when I look at e-Discovery, I mean, I'm seeing more and more activity from customers needing help with legal discovery. And so I see that as a nice add-on opportunity to what we're doing in the core Backup and Archiving business.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "If I could just ask a quick follow-up on the Mobile business, you said over the next 12 to 24 months, you'll see more mobile capabilities accelerating. How do you think that happens? Do you think you'll increase your attach rate on tablets? Are you in front of a new product cycle? What do you see as the primary driver of that?", "Enrique Salem", "On the enterprise side, in particular, what we see is customers are all telling us they want to adopt a policy of bring-your-own device to work, meaning that people can bring their own devices. And as they bring in tablets, as they bring in Android or IOS devices, what they want to be able to do is have a certain level of control on those devices equivalent to the control they have on a company-issued PC. And so our ability to manage, whether it be a tablet or phone or a desktop or laptop, is a clear benefit to our capabilities that we offer today. And so as we bring that together, that creates an opportunity because customers don't want managed phones and tablets one way and laptops and PCs another. And so as you think about our portfolio, that's a very logical extension to what we're doing with our Altiris platform. When you think about -- one of the biggest challenges people are worried about right now is what information is getting onto those tablets, right? They're worried that corporate confidential data is getting out to that device and they don't have the same control or security and so they're asking us for help on how do you keep that information off the device, how you also make sure you can authenticate a user that's going on to that device. And so I see clear opportunities in the enterprise space to unify management, to simplify authentication, to improve data loss prevention. And if you look at the performance of our DLP business, clearly they're saying give us DLP on these mobile and tablet form factors. On the consumer side, what we're seeing is clearly, there's a series of other things that we can do, new capabilities that we'll be talking about on the mobile platforms. They're quite frankly different than what we've traditionally done on a PC. It's, in my opinion, short term. It's a little bit less about anti-malware, it's more about simplification, simplify authentication and also help them be able to synchronize information more effectively. And so I see opportunities both on the enterprise side and the consumer side as customers and consumers adopt tablet and other mobile form factors.", "Operator", "Our next question will go to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "Enrique, your conscious strategy of de-emphasizing your internal services work and giving it to partners. Can you just give a sense of how that's impacting you in the field? And considering the bookings number, has that been helpful to what you've been seeing the last few quarters in terms of the improvement there?", "Enrique Salem", "We embarked on that strategy initially in October of 2009 with our mid-market customers and we expanded, as you know, at the beginning of last fiscal year. As I talked to our partner community, it really is being very clear that, that is driving partner loyalty towards Symantec. The channel is absolutely saying it's driving them to be more loyal to Symantec, and that's a clear benefit. As far as at the higher end of the market, our own sales force is now being compensated on license sales and on -- not on unnecessarily selling the consulting services component. And so that is absolutely driving a focus because to make their numbers, they have to drive the sale of our products and licenses around our products, and so it's clearly been a benefit. We had a couple of transitional issues as we enabled the partner community at the beginning of the fiscal year but we're well through that at this point. And we're pleased with the partner-led consulting efforts. But clearly, we continue to think of ways to refine that overall effort and make sure that our sales team focuses on what we want, which is driving new licenses.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "Just a quick follow-up for James. You saw a material increase in big deals over $10 million. I think you had over $100 million incremental gain, if that's right in terms of the numbers you gave year-over-year.", "James Beer", "Yes.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "I guess, other than just cross selling a number of these new products, were there any common characteristics that you're seeing in these big deals?", "James Beer", "Well, I think there was a lot of the customers recommitting to our Storage Management as well as our Backup businesses. And at the same time, DLP is clearly a key security technology that the biggest customers are investing in quite quickly. And we're very pleased to be the leader in that DLP field, I think, quite clearly. And we've really been able to benefit in these very large deals as a result. So it's really a combination of those 3 themes that were driving things. The other thing I'd say is we have a strong quarter in financial services, in particular, but it wasn't just there. It was across several different verticals.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "First, you, Enrique, obviously, you had a very strong license growing year-over-year. You talked about increasing emphasis just on license revenue. Should we expect any changes just with the turn of the fiscal year, whether it be on the comp plans? It didn't sound like that was going to be the case or just the structure of the go-to market strategy. And then also just, James, wondering if you could give us a little insight in that interest and other income expense line? That's been recently high the past couple of quarters obviously with some of the debt, but how would you expect it to look in Q1 and then kind of trend over the fiscal year?", "Enrique Salem", "Phil, at this point, no, we're not planning on making any structural changes to the overall sales organization. We're seeing increased effectiveness in the current structure. We're pleased with the execution we just saw the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year, and clearly, the specialization that we've driven and how we focused on not only our own team's specialization but our partners and channel specialization is working. And so at this point, we're not planning on making any changes to the sales force.", "James Beer", "In terms of the below-the-line items, I wouldn't point to anything particularly material per se. Obviously, the interest income will go up and down based on where the cash balance is. As I've mentioned in my remarks, we'll be paying back the last [ph] $600 million of the 2011 converts shortly, so that will reduce the cash balance and a little bit the interest income. We do have the higher interest expense as a result of the debt that we entered into last year. And then the Hua Sy [Huawei Symantec] joint venture is the other item that we particularly break out there and we'd look for improvements there over time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.", "Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Enrique, I think you mentioned on the VeriSign side that you're experiencing a mix shift towards the higher price to premium versions. That's not something that we'd been hearing in a while of VeriSign stand. Can you talk to what's driving that? I know you've talked about an up sell strategy just right after you made the acquisition. Is that what is driving that the mix shift towards the premium versions? And my follow-up question is on the corporate securities side, if I were to pick at all at anything if you excluded the acquisitions, it looks like growth is relatively flattish. So does that get better as you start to get the revenue recognition from the bookings going forward?", "Enrique Salem", "Kash, as you commented, one of the things that we always knew would be a benefit to having the VeriSign Security Business inside of Symantec is the ability to cross sell more security capabilities at the moment of purchase of the core certificate business and so we're absolutely seeing that, examples, we talked about host-based security but we're also -- the malware scans, meaning, making sure not only do they have extended validation certificate but also that the site is regularly checked and not having any issues with malware being embedded on the site, and so our ability to expand what is being sold has clearly been a benefit. The second point is, given our consumer distribution and our ability to take our what we call Seal-in-Search to many more customers, what you're starting to see is, people seeing the check mark, which is associated with trust, on lots of search results. And so they're starting to be -- our view -- that customers are seeing the real value of working with the extended validation certificate. And because when you do that, that's when you get that extra level of assurance when you do a Google or Yahoo! or Ask search. And so that combination, we're able to more effectively monetize the high-end certificates. I also have to say that the team that came over from the VeriSign transaction is just doing an outstanding job. They're very focused, they have very capable leaders and they are driving a very disciplined process that we're reaping the benefits of. And so, so far, I'm very pleased with our ability to extend the capabilities and the execution of the team. Kash, you had a second part to your question?", "Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "If I had to pick apart the Corporate Security business, if we exclude the acquisitions growth, looks like it was a little bit flattish. I'm wondering if that gets better especially as you start to recognize the revenues from your deferred revenues.", "James Beer", "Well, I think, you've got a few things going on in that business segment. Within there, we have our hosted services or certainly the majority of them since they're security oriented, and I would expect those to continue to grow as they did nicely in fiscal year '11. On the other hand, the Endpoint Security business while we believe is going nicely in the large enterprise end, we've still got some challenges around the SMB sector. And so it's really going to be the netting out of those effects that will drive the growth rate of security and compliance x acquisitions.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Philip Rueppel with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Philip Rueppel", "On the security side, you mentioned DLP a number of times. Is that a segment getting a second wind or are you just starting to see bigger deals? Is there a more broad-based strength? And you also mentioned that you see a lot of ties with encryption there. Are there other products that it is dragging along? And is it itself becoming a meaningful piece of the security revenues?", "Enrique Salem", "DLP is definitely we're seeing both -- we are seeing larger deals but we are seeing expansion into just the broader segments of the market. We also are seeing expansion into Europe and other parts of the world because historically that had been a business that performed very well in the U.S. and we're seeing it expand outside of the U.S. We are seeing a pull-through of other products -- encryption. It's changing and making our relationship with the CISO much more visible and prominent. And so it is having a positive effect on the overall performance of security, and we expect that to continue given the number of high-profile events that have happened over the last 12 months or security incidents that have happened over the last 12 months. Customers are absolutely looking for what do they need to do to protect their confidential data, their intellectual property and information they use to run their businesses. And so we expect DLP to continue to perform well.", "Philip Rueppel", "My second question would be around the consumer space. Are you seeing any changes as you define that more broadly to include mobile changes and who you view as competitors and any update on anything that has transpired with McAfee now that it is fully absorbed?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, I don't think we've seen any big changes there. At the end of the day, I'm feeling very good about the momentum. Both our Consumer Enterprise businesses are building. We clearly see as the acquisition of McAfee into Intel that they're going through an integration process and that creates a distraction, disruption for them and we're going to capitalize on it. We're obviously focused on what they may bring out. We're listening and watching. And right now, we're focused on executing our strategy, which is how do we help customers clearly take advantage of all these new devices that they're using and help them be much more flexible in letting their employees use those devices. And so ultimately, I feel very good about the opportunity ahead of Symantec.", "Helyn Corcos", "So with that, we're at the top of the hour. We thank you all for your questions. I'm going to turn it back to Enrique for some final comments.", "Enrique Salem", "So I'm clearly pleased with how our team executed, better than expected in the March quarter, and I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year. And I'd like to thank you for joining us this afternoon. I look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference call.

A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website as well. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the Investor Relations website shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Sequential growth rates are based on as recorded results.

We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which can be accessed on our Investor Relations website. ", "We made modifications to our segment reporting this quarter. Managed Security Services were moved to the Security and Compliance segment from the Services segment. Total MSS revenue of $72 million and $71 million moved in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Historical compares for our fiscal years 2011 and 2010, reflecting our modified segment reporting are available on our website and in our supplemental financial information.

", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique Salem", "Thank you, Helyn and good afternoon, everyone. Our team executed very well, delivering record June quarter results. We had a great start to our fiscal year, continuing the momentum we've been building over the past 4 quarters. Our third consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth resulted in the strongest June quarter, revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow in Symantec's history. Performance was driven by strength in Backup, Data Loss Prevention, Managed Security Services and Consumer, as well as ongoing stabilization of our Storage and Availability Management business. In addition, our authentication business once again exceeded expectations and delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected results. ", "Now, let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. I'm very pleased with our sales team's performance this quarter. Focused execution, combined with industry-leading security, backup and data center solutions, helped us deliver strong results across all regions. Customers are expanding their commitment to Symantec as our sales force successfully cross sells the entire product portfolio. During the June quarter, 48% of our deals over $1 million included sales from both our security and compliance and storage and server management segments, as compared to 26% for the year-ago period. License revenue grew, for the second consecutive quarter, driven by Data Loss Prevention and Backup, as well as ongoing stabilization in the storage and availability management business. ", "Our storage and availability management business posted its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year bookings growth, driven by increased penetration on the Linux and Windows platforms. Customers are recommitting to our storage management products as we differentiate ourselves from native tools. Our ability to help organizations accelerate the utilization of virtualization, cloud adoption and reduce storage costs are helping us win competitive deals. We're pleased with the success we're having with our partnership with Red Hat as we help organizations migrate to Linux. Furthermore, we're gaining traction with our new ApplicationHA solution, which was jointly developed with VMware. This product helps organizations virtualize their business-critical applications with confidence and reduce costs as they virtualize their infrastructure. ", "During the quarter, we had major storage management wins in the telecommunications and financial services verticals. One of the largest cable and Internet service providers increased their investment in Symantec beyond security and expanded their commitment to our storage management products. ", "Moving on to our backup and archiving business. Effective backup and recovery continues to be a high priority for organizations as they seek to better manage information growth and maximize operational efficiency. Our market-leading information management portfolio is helping organizations protect and manage their data. Our recently announced V-Ray technology further extends our information management leadership in virtualized environments. V-Ray is embedded into our backup products and gives IT administrators increased visibility into backup images across physical and virtual environments. ", "We generated growth in our backup and archiving solutions in all regions. Specifically, NetBackup posted another quarter of year-over-year, double-digit revenue growth driven by strength in virtualization and deduplication. We are beating our competition worldwide in gaining share in the backup software market. Increased customer adoption for our integrated backup and deduplication appliance is driving better-than-expected results. We signed a multiyear agreement with one of the world's largest logistics services companies for the deployment of our archiving and backup solutions. Additionally, we are expanding Backup Exec into new delivery models by introducing SaaS and appliance offerings. Both will be available later this year. ", "Our market-leading archiving product, Enterprise Vault, posted double-digit bookings growth, driven by strong execution across all geographies. At the end of the June quarter, we closed our acquisition of Clearwell, a recognized leader in the eDiscovery market. Together, Symantec and Clearwell are well-positioned to provide customers the most comprehensive information management solution by bringing together the industry's leading eDiscovery, archiving and backup products. ", "Now moving on to security and compliance. The current threat environment is driving increased awareness for information security. Customers recognize the value of having an information-centric solution that protects their confidential and proprietary data. Our approach is protecting information and identities makes us the strategic advisor for CISOs worldwide. We continue to expand our encryption, authentication, Data Loss Prevention and compliance solutions in the enterprise segment. In particular, our DLP solution generated another quarter of strong year-over-year double-digit revenue growth, driven by one of the largest U.S. retailers and one of the largest semiconductor companies becoming Symantec DLP customers. ", "Our VeriSign Security business once again exceeded expectations across all financial metrics. Both our premium and value SSL offerings gained market share, driving double-digit installed base growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to differentiate our premium VeriSign brand from the competition, with unique features such as daily malware scans and Seal-in-Search. With the anticipated launch of our SSL certificate discovery and automation service later this year, we will help organizations increase their visibility and better manage the growing number of SSL certificates across their environment. No other SSL provider offers this feature. In the user authentication business, which includes soft tokens and PKI, we recently hit an important milestone, issuing more than 0.25 billion certificates, verifying user and device identity. Our user authentication business has benefited from increased interest in our solutions as a result of the more toxic and targeted threat landscape. ", "To help in managing today's targeted threats, we launched Symantec Endpoint Protection 12 and Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition 12 in early July. Independent tests conducted by DennisLabs, The Tolly Group, AV-Test.org and  PassMark showed that our endpoints security solutions outperforms the competition in performance and effectiveness in both virtual and physical environments. SEP 12 is optimized for performance on virtual environments, reducing load on virtual servers and is integrated with VMware's security APIs. In addition, our products include behavioral and cloud-based reputation technologies known as SONAR and Insight that detect and block new threats earlier and more accurately than any other competitor. ", "Many organizations like the in-house security expertise and infrastructure required to address the rapidly changing threat landscape that is driving increased demand for outsourced security services. Symantec's Managed Security Services provide experienced specialists to help customers manage their security operations. As a result, our MSS business realized its third consecutive quarter of double-digit bookings growth. More and more customers are relying on us to provide a cost-effective 24/7 service to protect their information assets. We are again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant, highlighting Symantec's objective of reducing overall security risk.", "Moving on to Consumer. Our Consumer business delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, driven by our ability to attract and retain more customers through our online store and the strength of our products and services. Ongoing enhancements to our eCommerce platform continue to maximize customer spend and improve close rates. Customer satisfaction with eStores transactions is at its highest ever, benefiting our cross-selling and renewal efforts. ", "Our Norton Security products continue to be the fastest and lightest security products in the market. Over the last year, our Norton 2011 and Norton 2012 products have won more than 130 awards. We're extending our leadership beyond the PC to protect people and information through a variety of offerings, such as NortonLive  services, Online Backup and family safety services. These new services offerings grew 37% in the June quarter as we expanded distribution of these offerings to our multichannel network. The value of our Norton services has helped us expand and build new partner relationships. In addition, existing Norton Online Backup partnership with Acer, we expanded our relationship to include Norton Online Family under Acer-branded PCs. Acer will also include online backup and family safety services, along with Norton Internet security under Gateway, eMachines and Packard Bell PCs. Furthermore, we won a competitive deal at AOL to offer Norton Internet security to their large installed base of customers. ", "We launched 2 new mobile beta products to enhance our consumer mobile offerings. Norton Mobile Security for Android 2.0 includes anti-phishing technology to protect users who access e-mail on their smartphones. Norton Mobile Security has already been downloaded from the Android market over 600,000 times. Norton Online Family added a new mobile application that allows parents to view their children's online activities from their Apple and Android devices.  Partner interest in our new mobile offerings is growing and gaining traction around the world. We expanded our OEM relationship with Toshiba and Lenovo to provide Norton Mobile Security with their tablets. ", "On the carrier side, Wiz [ph] Telecom in France will also offer our mobile security solution for Android devices. Additionally, our Norton DNS offering is providing value to a new audience. Three major Wi-Fi providers will include Norton DNS with in-store Wi-Fi for major U.S. food and beverage retail chain. We're making solid progress in providing consumers the best online experience that allows them to securely access their information from any device. ", "I'm very pleased with our record June quarter performance. Our sales team continues to execute cross-selling our industry-leading portfolio and capturing new customers by aggressively pursuing competitive displacements. ", "We will continue to focus on a few key priorities. We're energizing our core businesses by helping customers deal with the challenges of rapid information growth and new, more targeted and sophisticated attacks. ", "Specifically, we're paying more attention to the SMB market. We've created a new SMB team that's working across the organization to tailor more of our solutions and go-to-market efforts to the unique needs of the SMB customer. We're capitalizing on new growth opportunities in cloud, mobile and virtualization and we'll continue to deliver new solutions to help both customers and enterprises securely access and use information across multiple devices and platforms. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique and good afternoon. We posted better-than-expected first quarter results for each of our key financial metrics, driven by solid bookings across all segments and geographies. Our strong performance resulted in record June quarter revenue, deferred revenue and cash flow from operations. ", "GAAP revenue totaled $1.65 billion, an increase of 9% versus the June 2010 period. License revenue grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in our backup, archiving and Data Loss Prevention businesses, as well as ongoing stabilization in our Storage and Availability Management business. Content, subscription and maintenance revenues continued to grow, increasing 10% year-over-year. Increasing subscription sales from our Consumer, Software-as-a-Service and Authentication businesses accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue, up from 36% in the year-ago period. ", "The U.S. dollar weakened 14% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by 6 percentage points year-over-year and approximately 1.5 percentage points sequentially. However, foreign currency movements negatively impacted operating expenses by 6 percentage points year-over-year and approximately 1 percentage point sequentially. ", "Net income of $309 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40, driven by the team's solid sales execution. The Consumer business generated revenue of $525 million, up 5% year-over-year, driven by improving renewal rates, upselling customers to our premium suites and cross-selling of our new service offerings. ", "Turning now to the Enterprise business, solid sales execution continued this quarter. We generated a total of 281 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 15% year-over-year. 57 of these transactions were valued at more than $1 million, up 54% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 74% included multiple products. ", "The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $597 million, an increase of 7% as compared to the June 2010 quarter. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup and archiving offerings, increased 10% year-over-year, driven by our differentiated deduplication and virtual machine protection features. In addition, we realized $3 million of revenue from the Clearwell acquisition, which closed earlier than expected on June 24. Revenue from the Storage and Availability Management business grew 3% year-over-year as we further diversified our platform penetration beyond Sun Solaris and other UNIX platforms into Linux and Windows environments. ", "The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $468 million, up 24% year-over-year, driven by strength in authentication services, Data Loss Prevention, Compliance and Managed Security Services, as well as continued growth in our SaaS business. The former VeriSign Security Business performed better than expected across all metrics, generating both revenue of $74 million versus our expectation of $70 million and $0.005 of EPS accretion, beating our forecast of $0.01 of dilution.  Our Services business generated revenue of $63 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. ", "Turning now to total company margins, non-GAAP gross margin was 86% for the June 2011 quarter, up 50 basis points from the year ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27%, down 30 basis points compared to the June 2010 quarter, driven by the acquisition-related deferred revenue writedown. We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $503 million. ", "We exited the June quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we utilized domestic cash to repay the remaining $600 million principal balance of our convertible senior notes, which matured on June 15th. We also used domestic cash to pay $364 million for Clearwell and $198 million to repurchase 10 million of our shares at an average price of $18.98. This cash expenditure resulted in approximately 33% of our cash balance residing in the U.S. as we exited the June quarter. ", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of June 2011 was $3.69 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Approximately half of the deferred revenue growth was related to acquisitions. ", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2011 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.43 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.30 and the end of period rate of $1.38 per euro in the September 2010 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate, before consideration of any loss from our joint venture, of 28% and the common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 763 million shares.  ", "Our CSE guidance does not include the potential for an increase in the share count from an accounting as opposed to economic perspective associated with our 2013 convertible notes in the event that our average stock price is at or above $19.12 during the quarter. Thus, for the September 2011 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.675 billion as compared to revenue of $1.48 billion during the September 2010 quarter. ", "We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 12% to 13% on an as-reported basis. 74% or $1.23 billion of our September quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. The Clearwell business is expected to contribute between $8 and $12 million to our September quarter revenue. As a reminder, we will complete a full year of operations for our VeriSign Security Business in the September quarter. And as such, we will no longer be breaking out guidance for this business. ", "GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.21 and $0.22 as compared to $0.17 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.38 to $0.39 as compared to $0.34 in the year ago period. As previously mentioned, we expect $0.01 of dilution as a result of our Clearwell acquisition during the quarter. ", "GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.485 billion and $3.515 billion compared to $3.1 billion at the end of September 2010. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 12% to 13% on an as-reported basis. It's important to note that as we anniversary the VeriSign security transaction, our deferred revenue growth rate will begin to normalize. Consistent with the strength of our business, we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow and be subject to normal seasonal trends, which drive a sequential decline in deferred revenue between the June and September quarters.  Last year, the combined effect of foreign exchange and acquisitions masked this trend. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize mid to high single-digit deferred revenue growth in the second half of our fiscal year. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased by the consistent strength of our cash flow from operations. While the September quarter typically produces the lowest operating cash flow of any other quarter, we expect our cash flow generation in the first half of fiscal year 2012 to be up approximately 20% year-over-year. ", "In conclusion, we were pleased with our strong performance across all of our business units, geographies and financial metrics. We will continue to focus on consistent execution and expense management in order to continue to drive both top and bottom line growth. ", "And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like update you on a few upcoming events. We will be presenting at the Citi Technology Conference on September 7 in New York and the Deutsche Technology Conference on September 13 in Las Vegas. Lastly, we will be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on October 26. ", "For a complete list of our investor-related events, please visit our Events section of the Investor Relations website. Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Just 2 questions. One on the consumer side, Enrique, you talked about strength in that business and I'm just curious, we've had a just dramatically weakened consumer PC environment for the last 4 or 5 quarters and I'm wondering what do you see just in the characteristics of your business? It sounds like bookings are still relatively strong but I'm curious kind of how are you seeing that business change with a very much weakened consumer PC environment?", "Enrique Salem", "What we continue to see, Walter, is that our team continues to execute very well on the ability to continue to move people to our premium suites Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. And then, it's also just great execution on our using our own in-house eCommerce platform which allows us to do a much better job of monetizing and increasing the dollars per transaction for every new user that comes into our online store. So that combination in the core business is performing very, very well. The other side of it is as we move into some of our new initiatives throughout Norton Online Backup, NortonLive services, those services are now starting to contribute to the growth of the business and that's a new opportunity for us that we've just started to effectively monetize. I think we talked about a 37% growth in the non-core software components being Backup-like services and the other things that we're doing beyond the core products.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "And then Jamjes, just as a follow-up on the guidance. I guess if we do the math right, it looks like you're looking for billings that are about flat year-over-year. And I guess it seems like the trajectory of the business right now is better than that. And I'm just curious what you would expect that could cause things to potentially be worse than where they are right now?", "James Beer", "Well, I think when we look at an implied billings figure, we've really got to be careful to take into account the year-over-year impact on the deferred revenue balance, both acquisitions and foreign exchange. So, as you look to adjust for all of that, I'd be comfortable that we'll continue to see revenue and deferred revenue growing in the future. So that's why we really urge everyone to focus only around the implied billings statistics.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Enrique, Europe seem to have performed a bit weaker than the Americas and AsiaPAC. This is not all that surprising given some of the data points that we hear from other companies in the space. But can you maybe comment a little bit about what you're seeing specifically in the region?", "Enrique Salem", "Sure. As we look at -- as we look across the regions, and we look specifically at Europe, it's -- you're seeing what we reported. What I feel encouraged by is we're seeing good billings that are basically driving -- will drive future revenue. And this is one of the best quarters we've had probably in the last 4 or 5 coming out of Europe. We saw good strength out of our U.K. business. Our Central European business in Germany, Switzerland did very well. Also, some of the places where people have been very worried, I mean, along the Mediterranean, Spain, Italy, Greece, they all performed well for us. And so that will come through as we go forward and start recognizing the revenue coming out of the billings that we did in the quarter. So overall, Europe actually did better and it's showing up in the revenue right now, Brad.", "Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And James, if I could ask on the consumer business, 49% GAAP operating margin this quarter is the best that I think you've had in about 8 quarters. And I'm curious, is this mostly due to weaker PC shipments or is there something else that might be changing relative to pricing or conversion rates? Is there any insight you can give us there?", "James Beer", "Well, we did see lower OEM fees during the quarter. So that had really more to do with the structure of our agreements with the OEMs than it did any diminishment of units in the June quarter. In fact, we saw a pretty good growth in units in the June quarter. So there was a modest expense benefit, less than a handful of million dollars. So I was pleased with the ability to drive general execution there across the consumer business.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "This is Ken filling in for John. Just a question on your storage business. It looked like you saw a pretty decent growth this quarter and we wanted to know if that would kind of continue going forward as our goal continues to invest in their platforms and you expand into others?", "Enrique Salem", "We're definitely seeing a trend. It's a couple of quarters now that we've seen license improvement in that business. And that really is about our ability to drive in other platforms. Into the Linux platform, specifically, Red Hat, also on the Windows platform. And then we're also bringing new capabilities. I commented about ApplicationHA, which is a new product that we codeveloped with VMware, that is an important component of making a virtualized environment more robust. And so, we absolutely believe that the trends that you're seeing there are going to continue and it's important to note that a lot of the native tools or tools that are coming from some of the propriety vendors, we're definitely seeing people recommit and rebuy into the capabilities that we deliver from our storage management and availability business. I mean we saw some specific big deals where people had considered or started to use some of the alternatives from companies like you mentioned, Oracle and others. And we've recommitted to our capability. So we're pleased with the last several quarters of results in the storage and availability management business, and I actually believe that, that team that we put in place here at Symantec is just doing an outstanding job.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "My question's about the enterprise security business. It looks like, on a constant currency organic basis, it was flattish, and you've got what seems like a lot of product momentum there, so I guess 2 questions. One, when do you think some of the newer growth to your products start to have more of a material impact? And secondly, how are you feeling about the SMB business currently and its trajectory in terms of getting maybe a little bit better?", "Enrique Salem", "As you see our DLP business, our MSF security services, our authentication services continue to grow in overall scale, and also our SaaS businesses. I expect that, that will be a more meaningful contributor to the overall growth rate of the security compliance segment. SMB, we announced some changes in organizational structure in mid-May. And that team, we just did our business review. We're clearly starting to see progress, but that is a lot of work that we've got to do there around continuing to enable our partners, driving demand. I talked to -- touched on the new product, Adam, our Symantec Endpoint Protection for small business, the new release of SEP 12. And so there's a lot of work that we're doing to drive better results, but that continues to be a focus area for the company and I expect that will be the case for the remainder of this fiscal year and into next year. But I'm very happy with the work the team's already done, and I expect to see that continue to improve. But that's been the one area that we're going to have to continue to do some focused work.", "Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley", "If I could just ask a quick follow-up, it looked like very good large deal activity in the quarter that some were worried about the end of the quarter deal environment. Maybe talk a little bit about whether there was anything anomalous in large deals and what do you think drove the success there?", "Enrique Salem", "Absolutely. So it's actually better execution by our sales team. If you look at it, the team was very focused on getting a fast start to the year and it was everything from getting quotas out sooner to how do we make sure that we look at better account planning, how do we do better deal reviews, executive engagement. And I just think our sales team is executing better than we've seen in probably 5 to 10 years here at Symantec. I mean, I'm very pleased with the work they're doing, and they were focused on getting that fast start and they actually did it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "Enrique, just on the environment, obviously, the growth rate you're giving is a pretty solid outlook, but when you take into account some of the things that are going on in the government, as well as Europe, I would assume that's in your forecast. I just wanted to clarify that in just in terms of how you're thinking about that in the back half of the year. And then I just want to follow-up with a quick follow-up.", "Enrique Salem", "Sure Brent, so when you think about the current environment, we're very focused on the big trends that are driving our business. The threat landscape, I mean it's more toxic than ever. The attacks are more targeted. I mean, I go to -- every major customer I talk to is thinking about how do they protect their data, their environment, their infrastructure. And so, you've got that big trend that's a positive. The second thing is you continue to see the growth in data. And we've been, now for a number of quarters, delivering double-digit growth around our backup and archiving business. And that is because customers are really saying, \"How do I protect all of this data that's being created?\" And so that combination of those 2 trends are absolutely helping Symantec. Now as far as -- you comment on the current issues around the government, obviously, that's something that we don't control. I mean we're not really in a position to look at or say what happens. And so, our teams has absolutely been thinking through what is impacted by changes like that. And obviously, it's our federal business, and so we've thought through our expectations there. We understand the risks. And as we look at our forecasting process, while the government's an important part of our business, we have, as you know, a fairly diverse business, and we have thought through what those implications are. At this point though, like I said, we don't control what they do in Washington or anywhere else in the governments around the world and we're focused on continuing to drive much better execution here at Symantec, and hopefully, what you're seeing from our results is that, that's what we're doing quarter in and quarter out.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank", "And just a higher-level strategy question, there had been some network vendors that have talked about adding more endpoint security offerings and I guess just in terms of your emphasis on network, how do you think differently about that as others are starting to eye your market?", "Enrique Salem", "We're very much focused on the information. You -- the device to us is irrelevant. We feel like the device is where the end user interacts with the information that they use for their personal, for their personal life, for their corporate life, and we're very focused on that. Who are you and should you have access to the information? And I think that approach is separate from whatever the device is, or quite frankly, for what you can do at the network infrastructure layer. Now, that said, we obviously are sensitive to what our customers are saying, and what we continue to see as our results show in products like DLP and managed security services, they're coming to us and saying, \"Help us protect the information. Help us manage our security operations.\" And that's what we'll continue to do.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "This is Dennis Simson for Phil Winslow. License revenues beat expectations over the last couple of quarters, can you provide more details on what's driving the turnaround here and what your expectations are going forward?", "Enrique Salem", "Well, what we continue to see is as we drive some of these new product lines, DLP, Backup, the stabilization in our storage, management and availability business, I mean, these products are the biggest drivers of new license for the company, and we continue to see big, favorable moves in our direction. I mean we are winning in the DLP space. Our backup business is doing very, very well, not only on our traditional software business, but also our appliance business. We see an incredible demand for the work that we're doing in appliances. I was talking to the team just the other day and our ability to integrate deduplication, the media server capabilities into one appliance is absolutely what customers have wanted and we're delivering that into the market. We're, obviously, going to leverage our very big install base in Backup and take those appliances aggressively to market worldwide. So my expectation is that we will continue to see improvements in new license going forward. And also, that you've got to be sensitive to, which doesn't quite come across new license, is that some of our products, like our SaaS products, don't show up in new license, because those are more subscription-oriented. And got to look at that trade up, because over time, my expectation is you'll start seeing a bigger move to those subscription products, not just to the new license products. So that means MSS products, our SaaS-based offerings, the consumer business, obviously, and our new VeriSign assets will absolutely beat that more of that subscription or ratable-oriented offering.", "Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And can you provide some more color on the VeriSign business this quarter? I mean what you saw in terms of trends in overall ASPs and the mix of the premium Certs?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, we definitely are seeing the strategy that our team has taken of saying, \"We're going to go after every customer.\" If they're a value buyer, we've got a great strategy to satisfy that demand. If you're a premium buyer and you understand the differentiated value that we bring with the daily scans, the vulnerability protection on your site, the extent of validation certificate, so we are very comfortable with what we're seeing in the mix. I think prices have stabilized and our team is executing very, very well in our trust services business. And I think, again, that's something that is sustainable.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Neil Herman with Ticonderoga Securities.", "Neil Herman", "Looks like your operating cash flow growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis was about 50%, quite impressive. If you could kind of give us a sense in terms of your thoughts for the full year in terms of what we should be thinking about with respect to your operating cash flow? And then number 2, if you could update us a bit on the competitive environment, in particular, with McAfee as being part of Intel. Is that creating opportunities for you? And as part of that also, secure ID cards have had a problem. Is that also creating more opportunities for you as well?", "James Beer", "Let me take the cash flow question first of all. What I would expect is that for the first half of the fiscal year, our cash flow from operations is going to be up about 20% year-over-year, so a strong growth rate. And we don't offer full year guidance on that metric but we're certainly pleased with the first quarter's result and are looking to that first half metric that I mentioned.", "Enrique Salem", "With regards to the competitive environment, clearly we've got a distracted competitor. I mean, you're integrating what was a focused security company into a much larger semiconductor company, more diversified portfolio. And so that's a benefit to us. We're clearly seeing some displacements. We're seeing a lot of people leave, they had some leadership changes there. And so my expectation is that, that is a benefit to our security business that will continue for some time. With regards to some of the other attacks and some of the other things that we talked about, clearly there is customer concern about the attacks. We talked about a specific vendor in RSA and that is driving -- people coming to us and saying, \"How can we use your VeriSign identity protection technology as a replacement for some, if not all, the deployment that we've got with our existing offering?\" And so ultimately, both of those are positives for Symantec, and I expect them to continue for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Just a follow-up on the storage business. Stabilization for Sun, obviously, has been a well-documented topic, but it's nice to see storage management revenues actually grow year-over-year, something we haven't seen in a long time. Just wondering, Enrique, if you can update us on the outlook for your storage management business. In particular, we all know it's not high growth, certainly, but curious if you think you've turned a corner there?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at that business, what's important to us is that we are competing well against the native tools, we're adding other platforms and doing well on Linux, and we're doing well in Windows. And then we're also adding new capabilities. So we're bringing things like Application HA. And so you're right, we've had some pretty big headwinds there over the last several years that our team has been able to say, \"Here is how we go after that market and create real value for customers.\" And customers still see the value, the clear value in our high-performance file systems, some of the new functionality around thin provisioning, some of the new work we've done on high availability. And so, I do believe that great execution there by our team and customers' understanding the value we bring on virtualized platform for the products like ApplicationHA are all positive. Now, Remember AppHA is a new product that's relatively small, and so it's going to take time for that to have any kind of meaningful impact on the business.", "James Beer", "And I think also the fact that our products work across the range of different environments that tend to be resident in the data center is really of great value to our customers as well.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then a quick follow-up on Clearwell. James, you talked about $8 million to $12 million in revenues. Previously, you were looking for $10 million to $15 million. Is that just because of the earlier-than-expected close or are there any other reasons?", "James Beer", "No. It's just our sense right now for where we see the Clearwell opportunity and obviously we're going to go and work and see if we can beat that number.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Maybe James, just a quick housekeeping item. I know you mentioned taxes have been 28% for this coming quarter. Any change in the tax rate beyond that, that you could help us understand?", "James Beer", "No, I think that's a good planning assumption for the year at this stage, and we'll update you each quarter.", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Great. And then Enrique, you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks or at least in the large deal count, you're seeing very good cross sell opportunity. Have -- or can you provide us any kind of color in terms of that, do you think of your customer base? How many of them have the multiple products? Or just kind of what is the penetration opportunity of that cross sell?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at our customer base, what you've got is our team is doing a great job of building stronger and better relationships of our accounts [ph]. A lot of that starts with -- we're very focused on measuring customer loyalty and our customer loyalty numbers in general, over the last several years, have trended up. And so that means, we're building better relationships at our accounts and the whole company's focused on that. As far as the specific metric of what we've got as far as how many of our customers have both, majority of customers in the Global 2000 use some level of product from Symantec, that they have some security from Symantec, they have some of our storage products. What really is happening is that they're expanding the utilization of those products. So that's how you want to think about it. In some of the deals I mentioned, for example, the one with the large telecommunications provider, they were already using security. They had some of our storage products but they decided to extend the use further, to use more of them. And that's what I expect with great execution of our sales team is that we'll be able to get more revenue per customer as they use more of our portfolio. With Clearwell, for example, as we bring that in, that's going to be a strengthening of both our backup and archiving businesses. And so that'll, again, give us one more thing to drive into the account base. And I absolutely expect that customers will do more with a broader set of Symantec's products. In every call, we talk about cross-sell opportunities, and I think our sales team is doing a great job of making that happen.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tom Ernst with Deutsche Bank.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "This is Joe Vimati [ph] on behalf of Tom. I'd like to understand the Mobile business. In particular, can you talk about the business model and the market share in terms of some of your new products, like Norton Mobile do a lot of - which is seeing a lot of downloads?", "Enrique Salem", "When you look at the mobile space, we've had 600,000 downloads, and so we are seeing interest. One of the questions I get all the time is, is there going to be a need for security products in some of these mobile platforms? Well what we're seeing is absolutely customers believe there's a need with a lot of these downloads. But it's still early and there's still 1.4 billion PCs that need to be protected. I don't have a market share statistic for you as far as mobile market share because it's just one of those things that I haven't seen any external data. But what I'm really pleased with is a couple of things. One, I believe there's clear demand for the mobile platform. Two, I think the focus Symantec has in that area under both Janice in Consumer and Francis in Enterprise is going to allow us to capture a meaningful part of the market. And so as that market unfolds, I am confident we're going to do very well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Philip Rueppel with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Philip Rueppel", "James, your guidance for next quarter implies operating margins -- non-GAAP operating margins declining. Is that due to just the Clearwell operating expenses or are there some other investments that you're making on the operating expense lines?", "James Beer", "Clearly, there's an impact from Clearwell on the operating margin side. But I'm comfortable that, what I said at the analyst day about operating margins, is still operative for the year.", "Philip Rueppel", "Okay. And then just on the Clearwell business, is it fully integrated now? Is that $8 million to $12 million that you mentioned, is that kind of a full quarter for them and is it in the hands of Symantec's sales reps? Or is that yet to come in future periods?", "James Beer", "Yes, that is a full quarter of revenue from Clearwell in the September period. We're certainly very much engaged in terms of updating the sales force on the opportunity to enhance what is already our e-Discovery offerings, to integrate those e-Discovery capabilities with our market-leading archiving capability. So we feel as though we're in a good space here and we now have the leading solution. And so we're getting very focused on getting that to market as quickly as we can.", "Philip Rueppel", "Great. And one more if I could. Enrique, you mentioned a couple of times the strength in the appliance piece of your business. Is that strength sort of being attractive to new customers or is it just as interesting for existing customers upgrading or expanding their platforms? And you mentioned Backup Exec will come on appliance. Are there other product areas and family that you see that you might introduce on the appliance form factor over the course of next year?", "Enrique Salem", "Yes, there are  2 parts to that, Phil. First, we absolutely -- a lot of the appliance businesses, with the high-end appliances, has been in our current install base. But we are seeing customers that have not been using our data protection solutions broadly. Take a close look at the appliances, because it does simplify the day-to-day deployment and management. When you can integrate a lot of the core backup infrastructure into one appliance, so you don't have to buy separate technology for deduplication, separate media servers, separate software, integrate that on to one box. That is definitely not just something that our install base wants, that's something that other new customers. But it's more in the install base, that is the early adoption. You are correct, the reason we moved to the appliances is because customers, again, want easier to manage, easier to deploy, and so you're seeing us develop and deliver a series of appliances. And so you've heard us talk about 2 or 3 different appliances. I expect that to continue, and you'll probably see several of our other products be delivered on the appliance form factor.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "James Wesman", "It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. In storage foundation, how did it grow quarter-to-quarter in license and maintenance and when do you expect it to start growing?", "Enrique Salem", "License and maintenance, so it's...", "James Beer", "Well, we saw growth, as we were alluding to earlier, the storage and availability management business was a contributor to that company growth in license. We saw company growth of 4% year-over-year, and while we don't break that number down into its constituent parts, it was clearly one of the contributors.", "James Wesman", "And I apologize if you guys have been over this. We've been flipping back and forth between calls.", "James Beer", "No problem.", "Enrique Salem", "No problem. We were -- just to be clear though, what we're trying to figure out is we saw license growth for several consecutive quarters and that business absolutely grew year-over-year. And so we just wanted to make sure we answered the right question.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Daniel Ives with FBR.", "Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yes, Enrique, I was just curious like when you went through sort of the quarter end close, did anything from just a high level surprised you in terms of just deal sizes, regions? Is there anything that stood out that you saw when you kind of went through sort of an end of the quarter deal for Python?", "Enrique Salem", "What I saw, to be honest, nothing really surprised me. What was clear is our -- the last several quarters, I've been encouraged by our close rates. I've just been seeing our team do a good job of driving to closure, and I think that's the disciplined process that our sales leadership team has been driving over the last several years, and so, nothing surprising, just real good execution by the sales team.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Craig Nankervis with First Analysis.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Enrique, you commented at the analyst event a couple of months ago or whenever it was that you pushed out some activities that you customarily accomplish in the June quarter to free up the company to have a fast start. Clearly, you've had a fast start. Can you go into that a bit, what you did that was different this time? And whatever it was, how much you attribute the results to that versus other factors?", "Enrique Salem", "I think ultimately we are very thoughtful about learning from what happened each quarter. And so what we've done is we said, \"What are the things that allow our team to get focused? Well let's get quotas out as early as possible. Let's look at whether anything that distracts or keeps our team from getting engaged in the quarter.\" And so there are a number of activities that we look to complete either virtually or push out. So, for example, our sales conference, we held it in July, instead of holding it in the first quarter. That's just one of many examples because the key is we obviously go as aggressive as possible to finish our fiscal year and so we've got to be in the pipeline building as early as possible. So the combination of quotas getting out earlier, moving some activities out and also thinking about the pipeline earlier, meaning not just waiting to your end quarter, because as you know, in enterprise software it takes time to build and close the pipeline. And so just the focus that we've had on doing a much better, more disciplined job of managing the sales organization, managing the accounts, managing the pipeline is obviously working.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Okay. Great. So whatever got pushed out is not going to have some sort of impact in another quarter, in which it's now going to be accomplished, it's not that sort of aftereffect thing?", "Enrique Salem", "No, it's not. Everything that we thought through what we needed to do, and like I said, I mean we basically have managed through all those activities. And the biggest drivers were really just great execution by the sales force and making sure we had the right account discipline.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Enrique Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique Salem", "Thanks, operator. I'm pleased with the team's execution and our better-than-expected results for the fourth consecutive quarter and I'm optimistic about our prospects for this quarter. So thank you for joining us this afternoon and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss fiscal second quarter 2012 financial result. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter, then James will highlight our financial results as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. ", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Net income, EPS and sequential growth rates are based on as-reported results. ", "For the September 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.41 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.34 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.43 per euro. For the September 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.30 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.38 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations website. ", "Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. ", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Thank you, Helen, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fifth quarter in a row, the team executed very well, delivering solid September quarter results. We generated record September revenue and deferred revenue. Performance was balanced across our business segments and geographies. Results were largely driven by strength in enterprise security, backup and Consumer. The VeriSign authentication business generated strong growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. In addition, the Clearwell acquisition completed its first full quarter, posting its largest bookings quarter ever and exceeding expectations. ", "Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Focused sales execution, coupled with industry-leading products, drove solid results in each region. Both the Americas and APJ regions grew double digits, and the growth in EMEA met expectations. Our public sector business generated record bookings this quarter as we closed several competitive wins. We are successfully cross-selling the product portfolio with 43% of our September quarter deals over $1 million, including sales from both enterprise product segments. Sales of Data Loss Prevention and backup solutions drove license revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. ", "Our enterprise security business generated another quarter of growth, reflecting improvement in the Endpoint Security business and strong performance for our Managed Security Services, Authentication and Data Loss Prevention businesses. Since the July launch of Symantec Endpoint Protection 12, the product has been successfully deployed on more than 1.3 million end points. I'm pleased with both the level of quality and effectiveness the solution provides for both virtual and physical environments. Early customer and partner feedback for both the enterprise and small business editions has been very positive. Recently, at our annual partner conference, several partners commented that the product is easy to deploy, and their customers have had 0 infections since installing the product due to SEP 12's new, innovative, reputation-based security technology. Partners serving the SMB segment in the U.S. and Canada are also excited about the ability to sell SEP.cloud for end customers' choice in deploying our security solutions. ", "The Managed Security Services business had another quarter of strong double-digit revenue and bookings growth. Customers are increasingly relying on our security expertise to protect their environments and information as many struggle to meet the IT staffing needs they require to confidently respond to new and emerging threats. Our Data Loss Prevention business posted strong double-digit growth as information protection continues to be top of mind for corporations and governments around the world. We've been a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for 6 years, making us the clear choice when CSOs [ph] evaluate DLP solutions. Further extending our leadership we'll be delivering the industry's first content aware DLP solution for tablets in early 2012. ", "Our Authentication business had another strong quarter as we continue to reap the benefits of leveraging Symantec's distribution channel for SSL and user authentication solutions. The SSL install base grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter as we increased our lead in both the premium and value segments. In addition, our cloud-based user authentication solution, known as VIP, had its best quarter ever. VIP is cost effective for customers and delivers strong authentication service that's allowing us to win competitive deals. ", "Our enterprise mobility strategy is focused on unifying identity, information and device-independent protection. We continue to make progress in helping our customers manage the increased adoption of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices in the enterprise. We launched Symantec Mobile Management 7.1, which now extends native controls to activate, secure and manage Apple iOS devices. Symantec Mobile Management 7.1 is a natural extension to Symantec's client management suite. ", "Moving on to our Information Management business, our backup solutions once again realized strong revenue growth as we continue to take share. Growth in this business is being driven by the ongoing adoption of our deduplication and virtualization capabilities. In addition, the V-Ray technology embedded in our backup products continues to differentiate us from the competition, allowing IT administrators increased visibility in the backup images across physical and virtual environments. Customer adoption of our NetBackup Appliances is growing as we have integrated backup, deduplication and the media server into a single offering, making it easier to deploy our solution and reduce total cost of ownership. Over the past 6 months, we sold more than twice as many appliances as compared to all of last year. ", "In August, we expanded our appliances into the SMB segment. Our Backup Exec Appliance is the first SMB backup clients [ph] which integrated client and target data deduplication for protecting virtual and physical machines. And for those customers who prefer a backup solution in the cloud, we launched Backup Exec.cloud. This SaaS-based solution is ideal for small businesses or remote offices with easy-to-use online backup and recovery, allowing customers to automatically protect their information on desktops and servers. ", "The Clearwell e-Discovery team, working with Symantec's Federal team, signed the largest deal in its history, driving their results above our original expectations in the September quarter. The team has done an outstanding job of integrating sales, operations and product development. As expected, Clearwell's e-Discovery solution complements our archiving capabilities. Customers value our ability to get relevant information to the right people while reducing the need for high-cost manual discovery. ", "Our storage and availability management business met our expectations this quarter, driven by customer demand for centralized management across Linux, Windows and UNIX platforms. Customers transitioning to non-UNIX-based environments are realizing that managing multiple point tools is costly, inefficient and ineffective. Our solutions help customers deal with this challenge, allowing them to adopt new platforms while maintaining their service levels and reducing storage costs and operational complexity. Customers are increasingly adopting our ApplicationHA solution for managing critical applications in virtualized environments. ", "Earlier this month, customers got a glimpse of how Symantec can help transform their IT infrastructure with the upcoming 6.0 release of Storage Foundation and Cluster Server. With this upcoming release, we expect to enable IT organizations to use their existing infrastructure to build and manage resilient private clouds that's in multiple virtualization technologies, operating systems and storage platforms. We expect this release to help us further stabilize this business and attract new customers while grappling with the challenge of having to do more with less. ", "Our Consumer Business generated a solid quarter of high single-digit revenue growth, driven by our strong, multichannel relationships, improvements in renewal rates via our eStore and the quality of our products and services. The consumer team has delivered consistent growth for the past 3 years. We signed more than 20 new deals worldwide across OEMs, service providers and alternative channels. We had a competitive win at Samsung to provide Norton Internet Security and Norton Online Backup on their laptops and notebooks. We expanded our partnership with AOL to offer Norton Online Backup to a majority of their paid subscribers starting this fall. ", "During the quarter, we continued to extend our security leadership with the release of the Norton 2012 products, which have once again set the industry bar for the best protection and performance. Our new products received PC Magazine Editors' Choice and CNET's top award. In total, Norton has won more than twice as many awards as our closest competitors combined. As part of the 2012 release, it is now possible for consumers to remotely manage their Norton products and subscriptions on multiple computers, all from a central location. In addition, we announced Norton One, which will be the industry's first personalized service that will protect consumers across multiple devices and platforms, including Windows, Mac and Android. This offering is expected to be available in the first half of 2012. ", "As part of our Norton Everywhere initiative, we extended our mobile offerings with Norton Mobile Security Light, Norton Tablet Security and Norton Anti-Theft. Since the launch of Norton Mobile Security Light, the premium version of our mobile security solution, we've averaged 170,000 downloads per month. These new products seamlessly combine antitheft  features with powerful anti-malware capabilities, giving users improved protection in the event their phone is lost, stolen or compromised. In addition to these new mobile offerings, we have several products already in the market, including Norton Mobile Security, Norton DNS and Norton Online Family for Android and iOS. ", "In conclusion, we have executed well against our FY '12 plan, delivering strong results in the first half of the year. We've been able to effectively integrate and grow our acquisitions consistently, and customers are embracing the value propositions we offer across our portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. In the second quarter, we once again achieved solid results driven by growth in bookings across all geographies and business segments. Our consistent execution drove record September quarter revenue and deferred revenue, as well as double-digit earnings per share growth. GAAP revenue totaled $1.68 billion, an increase of 9% versus the September 2010 quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened 8% against the euro as compared to the year-ago period. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by 5 percentage points. ", "License revenue grew 1% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in backup and Data Loss Prevention. Content, subscription and maintenance revenue continued to grow, up 11% year-over-year. Increasing subscription sales from our Consumer, Software-as-a-Service and Authentication businesses accounted for 39% of total revenue, up from 35% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income of $295 million grew 11% and resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39, up 15% from the September 2010 period. ", "The Consumer business delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, generating revenue of $531 million, up 9% year-over-year. If we exclude the impact of a 2010 onetime charge of $10 million, year-over-year revenue growth was 7%. Our new product and service offerings grew 52% and contributed 2 percentage points of revenue growth to the Consumer business. In the September quarter, OEM placement fees were higher than we originally forecast as our OEM partners increased their PC shipment volumes ahead of our expectations. In addition, it's important to note that OEM PC shipments are historically higher during the second half of our fiscal year with shipments and, therefore, OEM fees peaking in the December quarter. ", "Turning now to the enterprise business. Solid sales execution continued again this quarter. We generated a total of 373 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 17% year-over-year, and 56 transactions valued at more than $1 million, in line with our seasonal expectations. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 72% included multiple products. ", "The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $483 million, up 22% year-over-year. This performance was driven by growth in our Endpoint Security business with the successful release of SEP 12 as well as the continued strength of Data Loss Prevention and Managed Security Services. The VeriSign authentication business continued to perform well, generating revenue of $89 million in the September quarter. The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $605 million, an increase of 4% as compared to the September 2010 quarter. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup and archiving offerings, increased 11% year-over-year, driven by our differentiated deduplication and virtual machine protection features. In addition, we realized $20 million in revenue from our Clearwell acquisition, well above our expectations, due in part to a large federal deal that was not in our original forecast. Revenue from the storage and availability management business was down 7% for the quarter and down 2% for the first half of fiscal year 2012, in line with our expectations. Our services business generated revenue of $62 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. ", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.8% for the September 2011 quarter, up 10 basis points from the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.5%, down 40 basis points compared to the September 2010 quarter, in line with our expectations. ", "Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $308 million. We generated operating cash flow of $811 million for the first half of fiscal 2012, an increase of 26% year-over-year. We exited the September quarter with $2.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we utilized $275 million to repurchase 16 million of our shares at an average price of $17.30. 32% of our cash balance was on shore in the U.S. as we exited the September quarter. ", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of September 2011 was $3.45 billion, up 11% year-over-year. In the month of September, the dollar appreciated 7% against the euro, negatively impacting our reported end-of-quarter deferred revenue balance. At our guided rate of $1.43 per euro, deferred revenue would have totaled approximately $3.5 billion, at the high end of our guided range. ", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2011 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.37 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.35 and the end-of-period rate of $1.33 per euro in the December 2010 quarter. Our $1.37 per euro assumption reflects a 3% decrease from our weighted average rate of $1.41 for the September 2011 quarter. As a result, foreign currency movements would decrease estimates sequentially but provide a modest tailwind during the December quarter year-over-year. ", "Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28% and a common stock equivalent total for the quarter for approximately 745 million shares. Thus, for the December 2011 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.715 billion as compared to revenue of $1.604 billion during the December 2010 quarter. We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 6% to 7% on an as-reported basis. 71%, or $1.2 billion, of our December quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. The Clearwell business is expected to contribute between $13 million and $17 million to our December quarter revenue. ", "GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.25 and $0.26 as compared to $0.17 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.40 and $0.41 as compared to $0.35 in the year-ago period, up 14% to 17% on an as-reported basis. ", "As previously mentioned, we expect $0.005 of dilution as a result of our Clearwell acquisition during the quarter. In addition, U.S. GAAP accounting dictates that we no longer recognize quarterly losses from our joint venture now that the JV's cumulative losses exceed our original investments. The impact of this accounting requirement is reflected in our earnings per share guidance for the December quarter. ", "GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.685 billion and $3.705 billion compared to $3.408 billion at the end of December 2010. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 8% to 9% on an as-reported basis. ", "In conclusion, we are pleased with our execution and the solid performance across all of our geographies, segments and financial metrics. We will continue to focus on carefully managing our expenses while driving long-term growth and free cash flow generation. And now I'll turn it back over to Helen so we can start taking some of your questions", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We will be presenting at the UBS Conference on November 15 in New York, the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Conference on November 29 in Phoenix and the NASDAQ Investor Program on December 7 in London. Lastly, we'll be reporting our fiscal third quarter results on January 25. For a complete list of our investor-related events, please visit the Events section of the Investor Relations website. Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brian Freed - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Enrique, specifically on the Consumer business, it's great to see this kind of acceleration. I was hoping maybe you can give us a little bit more visibility to what it looks like on a bookings perspective. Just especially in light of what we're seeing with PC growth, the results are much stronger than we had expected. And also, if you can comment on the contribution from nontraditional products.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes, brad, thanks for the comments on the quarter. We're obviously pleased with our ability to consistently deliver against our guidance. What I was going to comment on was as you look at the PC business, the Consumer team just continues to deliver the best products on the market. I mean, it's evident from their ability to consistently win awards that people love what we're doing as far as the overall solution. And so what that's doing is it's allowing us to do a much better job of not only bringing in new customers over a range of channels, but it's also allowing us to get -- improving our renewal rates. A lot of that's being driven by the work we've done around the eStore where we can be much more effective at targeting the renewal with the appropriate offers, the appropriate price points and so forth. The other thing that's going on, and you heard in James' comments, that we did see good -- better shipments of OEM units into the call -- into the back-to-school/holiday season or the beginnings of the holiday season. And so my expectation is that while we'll continue to see pressure on the overall PC business given people diversifying to other nontraditional devices, we expect that this will be fairly common or as expected given the work that we've done. The other thing I did say in my comments was Janice's team has done a really good job of extending the number of new products that we're shipping on non-PC platforms: our Norton One initiative, some of the work we've done with Norton Everywhere and then some of the new mobile solutions. So we're getting nice distribution beyond our traditional PC products. You specifically asked how much of our revenue came from the non-PC products. And that is approximately 2% at this point of the total business that we're generating in Consumer.", "James Beer", "Well, 2 points of the growth...", "Enrique T. Salem", "Two points of the growth, that's right.", "James Beer", "Came from the traditional businesses.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Nontraditional.", "James Beer", "Yes, oh, the nontraditional businesses. That equates to about 4% or so of the overall consumer revenue.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "That's helpful color. If I could just ask a follow-up for James. James, just on margins, if I recall back to Financial Analyst Day, your guidance on margins at the time was for where the Street was at pre-Clearwell. So I think that was 26.3%. Looking at the first half, I think we're a little bit behind. And I haven't been able to run through all of your details on guidance, but I'm not sure that Q3 is much better than what we saw this quarter. I just want to know if your guidance from Financial Analyst Day still holds and if I've got that right.", "James Beer", "Well, you're right that at analyst day, we talked about 26.3%, and then the 0.2-point adjustment for Clearwell, bringing us down to 26.1%. So that's the discussion that we've had on operating margins. And we're continuing to go quarter-by-quarter to meet that goal.", "Operator", "And We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Danyaal Farooqui", "It's Danyaal for Walter. Enrique, you mentioned that Europe met expectations. Could you give any more granular detail on country level?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes, I'll give you a couple of thoughts. We grew 11%, as reported, 2% on constant currency basis. And what we saw was Central Europe continued to perform well, and we did see a little bit of weakness in the Mediterranean countries in the September quarter.", "Danyaal Farooqui", "Anything on Europe? I mean, anything on U.K., sorry?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes, yes. So as far as the U.K., we performed as expected. It was probably a little better than it's been. We had seen about 1 year ago a little bit of weakness in the public sector in the U.K. but definitely seemed a little more stable with a bit of improvement.", "Danyaal Farooqui", "Got it, okay. And then just one more. How much are you benefiting from bringing eCommerce in-house? Is there a way you could kind of quantify it and -- or tell me or tell us how much of financial benefit you've had this quarter for Consumer?", "Enrique T. Salem", "At this point, we're -- the -- because the eCommerce platform has been in our business now for several years, we're not breaking out any other deltas for year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter. But clearly, it is making a difference because more of our business is coming from the eStore, I mean, where over 80% of our business now comes through electronically. And so a big driver of the improvements in a lot of the work that we do is in that much better targeting. So ultimately, it is a absolute benefit to the business.", "James Beer", "Yes, I think the investment has helped build our cash flow and margins over time.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John DiFucci with JP Morgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I had a question on the storage business, Enrique. This continues to put up I'll call it respectable results after a couple of years of sort of tough sledding. But after next quarter, the comps, at least year-over-year, get tougher. And I just wonder if you think you can continue to put up mid-single digits, sometimes in the high single-digit growth. If you can continue to do this with the storage business? Or is it something we should just expect to be sort of a lower-growth business?", "Enrique T. Salem", "You're right that, that business has continued to improve. I think our team there is doing an outstanding job. And what's happening, John, is that we've been able to diversify away from the UNIX platform where, as you remember, a lot of the business was on UNIX. Now we're seeing a lot more business coming through on Linux, Windows and HP-UX. As far as the other things that we're doing in that business that I think are meaningful are the work that we've done to help optimize VMware environments with technologies like ApplicationHA or AppHA. And so I do see good momentum and improvements there. As far as the growth rate, I'm going to stick with what we've said at analyst day, which is this is a business that will be relatively flat for us. Obviously, we're going to work hard to outperform that. And there's a lot of good signs in the business because, as I commented on the last several calls, we're seeing people who want to simplify their environments, and that means not having lots of point products and lots of point tools spread out across multiple data centers. And that's where we're really seeing some kind of return back to using the products from our SAMG business. So, so far, I'm pleased with the performance. It's -- team's doing an outstanding job, and I expect that to continue.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "If I might, just a quick follow-up on the Security Compliance business. Exclude -- if you exclude acquisitions, and by the way, your acquisitions that appear to be performing very well here, but if you exclude that, you're sort of growing that sort of in low single digits, it looks to us anyway is this -- in this business and realize that most of that is sort of desktop or Endpoint Protection for corporate, is that sort of what we should be expecting for that part of that business anyway?", "James Beer", "Well, for the Security and Compliance business, if you adjust for acquisitions and also in a constant-currency basis, that business unit grew at 5% year-over-year. And so, I mean, that's reflecting the progress that we're making in Endpoint Security. We're very pleased with how the SEP 12 release has come out of the gates, continued growth around Data Loss Prevention and Software-as-a-Service.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm sorry, James. Did you say 5%?", "James Beer", "Yes, 5%. So that's adjusted for currency and acquisitions.", "Enrique T. Salem", "The other quick comment I'd kind of give you is we're very pleased with the launch of SEP 12. I mean, the feedback has been outstanding. I mean, 1.3 million end points have already been upgraded. The efficacy of the solution is proving to be just incredibly strong, and many of our customers are saying it was easy to deploy and they absolutely are seeing improvements in detection rates. So as you know, 75% of attacks now are hitting less than 50 machines. And so this new technology is really allowing customers to better protect their environments. And the feedback from both customers and partners has been better than I expected. And I think that also showed some improvements in the Security and Compliance segment.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And we hear -- actually, well, I hear similar things in the field.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Maybe just to follow up on the question of organic growth. James, what do you think your organic constant currency growth was in the quarter? And then maybe a longer-term question. As you think about the 3-year targets, and this may be for Enrique or James, that you gave at the analyst day, how do you bridge from where we are now to those 3-year targets? Is it about the environment getting a little bit better? Some of these acquisitions anniversary-ing? Maybe give us the bridge from here to there.", "James Beer", "Well, in terms of the organic constant currency growth rates, our revenue had been growing in the 3% to 4% type range. So that's a little bit faster than we have seen in the last 3 or 4 quarters. So a bit of a sequential improvement.", "Enrique T. Salem", "I think as we look forward, we're comfortable with where we set kind of 3-year growth rates at the 7% to 8% levels. And what really is driving that and will drive that is kind of 2 big thrusts. One is continuing to improve our core businesses. How do we continue to drive improvements in security with the great launch of products like SEP 12? But then also, the work we're doing with appliances around the backup business. So it's really about strengthening the core business. And then, it's executing against our vision and taking advantage of the opportunities around cloud computing, virtualization and mobility. I mean, some of the new technologies that we're showing both at our Vision conference in Europe that we just held  the beginning of the quarter -- beginning of this quarter where we showed people you can take a lot of that current infrastructure you have and re-tool it using our products to be more efficient, better utilized and create your own internal private cloud without having to procure lots of new equipment and software. And so we're seeing people -- especially in this what I'll say is folks trying to do a lot more with less, some of the solutions we're shipping or will be shipping with the 6.0 release will really help people do that. At this point, the combination of strengthening our core and taking advantage of some of these big trends that we've been talking about over the last several calls I think will enable us to achieve the growth rates. Now, obviously, we do expect that, that requires IT spending to continue at what I would say normal levels, and that's what'll make it possible.", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "If I could just sneak in one follow-up. It looks like the buyback accelerated in the quarter. Is that something you think we should expect to see continue? Or are you thinking about doing other things with your capital position, which is obviously strong?", "James Beer", "So the buyback did accelerate during the September quarter, and that very much reflected our approach of trying to buy a little more back when we see particular dislocations in the marketplace as we did in August.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just on Europe, can you just walk through what you think is happening? Obviously, I know it's been lagging the U.S. But -- and the U.S. has been recovering and Europe really hasn't recovered, and I'm just curious if there's something else going on in terms of the competitive landscape or something that you're seeing in terms of the deal structures that perhaps is holding Europe back still. Who would have thought that, that would have recovered a little bit better than it has?", "Enrique T. Salem", "What I would look at in Europe is I think we've been in an interesting kind of macro environment in Europe over the last 12 months. That's a little bit different than what we're seeing here in the U.S. And what I mean by that, Brent, is we -- a year ago, we were dealing with some weakness in the U.K., specifically in the public sector. Now as we look at it, given what's been happening in the Mediterranean countries, from Greece to Spain and Portugal, I think that that's continuing to put some level of pressure on the overall results coming out of Europe. Now the shining spot in all of this for us has consistently been the Central European area of Germany, Austria, Switzerland that continued to perform well for us. But we've seen different parts of Europe be weaker at different points. Operator?", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "This is Sonya [ph] on for Aaron. Just a quick question on the Storage Management business. So now that we've gotten through kind of the bulk of Sun-related declines, I guess can you comment a little bit on your expectations for the growth trajectory going forward?", "Enrique T. Salem", "I think as we -- I think you're right that we are at the tail end of the integration or the Sun-Oracle OEM contract. We're continuing to see that business stabilize. As we showed last quarter and this quarter, some of the other platforms beyond Sun Solaris are doing well for us. And I think the important point is that's stabilizing the overall segment. But then we're also seeing improvements in the backup business. We launched a new set of appliances that are doing very well for us. We're seeing a lot of demand for our approach of taking what used to be multiple point products, potentially some from us and some from others, and integrating it into one device where now you've got the backup software, the deduplication software and the media server all integrated into one appliance. And so that's also helping that business. We're coming up on a new product cycle with the backup products at the first half of next year. And so my expectation is that our backup business will continue to be the driver of growth in that overall segment.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay, that's helpful And then just quickly circling back on your points around SEP 12 or just Symantec Endpoint Protection 12. I guess can you speak a little bit to how meaningful you think the revenue opportunity is there? Is this more of a maintenance release where it seems like it'll be more related to seat expansion? Or is there a price increase associated with it as well?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes, it's definitely -- as we look at it, that -- it's a major release, and it integrates a number of new capabilities, most specifically the reputation-based technology that really is doing an outstanding job of detecting a lot of these very targeted threats. And also, because we worked very hard on the ease of deployment, and some of the early results are showing that where we have had previously a little bit of weakness in the SMB segment, I think this will be part of the improvement plan of tailoring products to serve that market segment well. So my expectation is that we'll continue to see improvements in the Security and Compliance segment where previously, the Endpoint Security business had been a bit of a drag on the overall business. The other thing that's important is we continue to see, post-Intel acquisition of McAfee, some disruption in their business and go-to-market. And that's helping us across the various segments now, and we expect that to continue.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on public sector. I think you talked about some good business performance towards the end of the quarter. With -- given all the controversy and the scrutiny on IT budgets in that sector, what's your view as to how spending trends hold up for your businesses based on your conversations and what sales people are telling you about how your products are being budgeted for the public sector?", "Enrique T. Salem", "It was a -- Kash, it was a record quarter for us in the public sector. I think the team executed very well, and the Clearwell acquisition performed well against our expectations and some of the larger deals came out of the public sector. Obviously, people are trying to figure out what happened to the federal budget. As you know, we're in this kind of wait and see what budget gets allocated in the new fiscal year. But as I kind of look and talk to a lot of folks, senior folks in government, the federal budget will be anywhere from $76 billion to $80 billion. And cyber security has become a big priority for governments around the world, and so my expectation is that we'll continue to see demand for a number of our security products. But I still expect it to be a very significant budget. I haven't seen dramatic changes in that area, and we'll wait and see what happens with the budget. But at this point, I do believe that we'll continue to do well. And the question is now what ultimately happens with the focus on cyber security and some of the other priority areas.", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And I don't know if you have time for one quick follow-up. But on the consumer security business, I was wondering if you could talk to conversion rates directionally?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes, if you look at what we've done with the eStore, it's pretty clear that our ability to really have a good understanding of what products they're using, what browsers, what price points they paid previously, is really enabling us to be much were effective at converting and getting more value per transaction of people coming to our online stores. So I would say that ultimately, we're getting benefits in 2 areas: better pricing or increases in pricing, and also better conversion rates.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Dennis in for Phil Winslow. Can you describe the trends you saw in the sales force productivity in the quarter and how much room you think you have for improvement there?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Well, thanks for asking the question because it's pretty clear that our sales force execution has continued to improve consistently over the last 18 months. I think it's a credit to Bill Robins and his team and the work they've done to institute a much more disciplined sales process. What I would comment is, I think there's continued room for improvement. I think we can continue to drive efficiency. I think we can continue to be even better at cross-selling the whole portfolio. We're giving you a metric right now that talks about our ability to cross-sell and what's happening with the larger deals. 43% of the deals above $1 million contained products from both segments. I think that's just our sales team is much more focused and disciplined in how they look at the Symantec portfolio and how that matches to the things our customers are trying to do. So I expect there will be continued improvements in sales force effectiveness and productivity.", "Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And can you describe maybe the trends that you saw? You commented on your traction with your backup products. If you can maybe expand there a little bit more, specifically in the SMB space?", "Enrique T. Salem", "With the backup product in particular?", "Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, in the SMB space.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes. So a number of things that we're doing is we're looking at what are all the capabilities that we need to deliver into the SMB space. Specifically, we've added 2 things, which are the new Backup Exec Appliance. It's early. Well, this was the first quarter at our partner event a couple of weeks ago. We showcased it, and there was genuine enthusiasm about our ability to deliver the Backup Exec Appliance, which will be targeted at the -- our mid-market/smaller-sized companies. I think the other thing that we're doing is clearly the Backup Exec.cloud or our cloud-based backup capabilities that will also allow us to better serve the SMB segment with the cloud-based offering. So my sense is the combination of Backup Exec.cloud and the new appliance are definitely going to help us there. And clearly, we're going to continue to work towards bundling both the security products with the backup products because IT buyers or smaller businesses, they want simpler. They want it easier. They don't want a lot of point products. And so ultimately, our ability to bring together the products from both our security and backup business will fit well with that segment.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. I actually would like to just swing back to the SEP products and specifically the mid-market or small business SPS SEP product that was also released recently. Do you have any kind of early feedback on how that's being received? I don't know if it's too early to get Net Promoter Scores. Or also, if you might be doing anything different in the channel to try driving adoption at that level?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes. Well, the Net Promoter Scores for the new version of SEP, of SEP, have done very well both in the enterprise and SMB markets. The initial data is showing multiple points of improvement, and that really is a tribute to the great work the team has done. I am very encouraged by the partner feedback, and I'm sure you're starting to hear the same thing, that people believe this is just an outstanding product. And my expectation is that it will  bring partners back in because what partners are trying to do is they're trying to optimize their time. And if they can -- if it's easier to deploy and they don't have to go back and potentially have to clean up when some of these machines gets infected, that really is something that allows them to be more productive, more efficient and then generate more profit for the partner. As far as from a go-to-market perspective in the partner segment, we've done a number of different things. We continue to be very focused on specialization where we're trying to make sure that partners have the necessary certifications to make each implementation successful. And that's why you are seeing the improvements in the Net Promoter Score, because our partners are becoming back that much more effective at implementing the new products. And so we're very confident that the new products, combined with some of the work we've done in the new channel, will drive improvements in the small business segment.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And just quickly on the VeriSign authentication business, have you done anything there with respect to the go-to-market strategy to broaden out either the breadth of distribution or things that are -- anything new and different on the go-to-market there that's helping the success there?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Well, absolutely. The big difference is you now have got a much larger sales force around the world that is able to take the user authentication products to market. But the other more important thing is that we're able to combine it with a much richer portfolio, because we're able to bring in the extensions around encryption, the extensions around malware and improved management platform. And so ultimately, the combination of product breadth and a larger go-to-market or sales force capability is definitely driving improvement. Also, there have been some attention as a result of some of the issues that one of our major competitors faced with an attack. And so my sense is that, that combination is definitely having a positive impact on our user authentication business.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Enrique or -- and James, you had mentioned that your OEM agreements had, I guess, higher costs upfront. Could you discuss what the competitive dynamics have been around some of those OEM agreements? And what do you expect going forward with any major renewals that might be coming up?", "James Beer", "Well, what I was referring to in my text was that our OEM fees actually came in higher during the September quarter than we were expecting would be the case 90 days prior, very much driven by the fact that the OEM partners shipped more PCs than, I think, everyone was expecting. So that effect added about half $0.005 worth of costs to the operating expense base. And the other point I was making in the text was that we would expect to see sequential increases between the September quarter and the December quarter in the total amount of OEM fees that we pay. So that would likely add something in the $0.01, $0.015 type realm. We'll see how we go with the OEM PC shipment volumes this quarter.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just a follow-up, if I may, on the Huawei-Symantec progress. I saw that you are making some moves in North America. We'd love an update on that.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Well, we're continuing to work on improving the overall product portfolio in that business across both the storage and security areas. And from a go-to-market perspective, kind of the next frontier for the joint venture is really getting traction in the U.S. The other part of that, as you know, we're in discussions around what's the best outcome for the joint venture. And so we're continuing down that path, working with Huawei to determine: is it something that we continue to manage jointly and drive towards an IPO? Or is there a potential different outcome? And so we're probably in the late innings of really having a determination. And I would hope that by the next call, the next earnings call, we'll have an opportunity to give you a more detailed update on where we are with that.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Enrique, given that over half of your organic constant currency growth is still coming out of consumer and you've got potentially Windows 8 on the horizon at some point, what's some of the industry thinking right now? What's the feedback been from the OEM channels? They actually make a decent amount of their money off AV being onboarded by folks like yourselves?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Well, I think everybody is looking at Windows 8 and  what are the things Microsoft's trying to do. Obviously, their priority is really around thinking out how they stay relevant in a what I'll call the move to next-generation or other non-PC devices. And that's really the priority. Everything we've seen, that's the focus. Now clearly, Microsoft, like all the vendors, is always trying to think about how they make sure that their platform is secure. And the OEMs, as you say, a part of the profits that they make is the aftermarket products that they sell, security being one of them. And so they're working closely with us and with Microsoft to make sure that we still can deliver, sell security products on their traditional PC platforms. Obviously, it's still early, Rob. There's -- they've shown some of the things that they're going to do. But we expect to see some continuing changes in the approach and what they're going to do with Defender and other things. So we're all working together. We've got folks in Redmond as we speak talking about how our security continues to add a lot of value beyond anything that's being done in the operating system.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then for James, what was the organic deferred revenue contribution from Clearwell?", "James Beer", "Clearwell, gosh that would have driven of the order of about $10 million to $15 million worth of additional deferred revenue, something of that nature.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to James Wesman with Raymond James.", "James Wesman", "It's James sitting in for Michael Turits. First question now. What is the VeriSign business growing pro forma x the remaining write-down?", "James Beer", "Well, the VeriSign business that we've seen growing in this past quarter at so mid to high single digits, so we're pleased with how the value-added items that Enrique was talking about on an earlier question, things like the additional malware scanning capabilities, the much enhanced management platform that we have integrated into the VeriSign SSL certificate sales, are getting traction in the marketplace.", "James Wesman", "Okay. And then one other question on the Consumer side. As you start selling into more emerging markets, though, what type of impact are you expecting on ASPs?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Well, clearly, the ASPs, there's more price sensitivity. And we've always used a number of approaches to emerging markets from some of the things we've done with our PC Tools brand to the work we're doing around some of the premium offerings where we can deliver a capability and then do some upselling. But clearly, there's more price sensitivity in the emerging markets, and we take that into account with the mix of products and price points.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Brian Freed with Wunderlich Securities.", "Brian Freed - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Can you guys give us a little bit more color around the scale and number of customers for your Norton Online Backup business? And maybe just some -- to the extent you can give some clarification as to what percentage of your consumer business you would attribute to that business?", "Enrique T. Salem", "So I'll give you -- the headline number is approximately 15 million, 1 5, 15 million people using our online backup capabilities. And what we continue to see is that business is driving good growth rates on top of a small base. We haven't broken out the specific online backup numbers, but when we talked about the 4% of the business coming from the nontraditional products is that one of the biggest drivers there, Brian, is the online backup business. But clearly, service is another thing. They're also contributing there. But ultimately, we are encouraged by the capabilities and the adoption of the online backup feature.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Enrique Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Thank you, operator. I'm pleased with the team's execution and solid results for the fifth consecutive quarter. We'll be focused on executing our key priorities for the remainder of the year. Thank you very much for joining us this afternoon, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss fiscal third quarter 2012 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter, then James will provide highlights of our financial result as well as discuss our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. ", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will review our financial results focusing on year-over-year constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Net income, EPS and sequential growth rates are based on as reported results. For the December 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.30 per euro compared to our guided rate of $1.37 per euro. For the December 2010 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.35 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro. We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release table and in our supplemental information, which can be accessed on the website. ", "Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in those statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. ", "And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with the team's execution of our information-centric vision. In addition, our strategy to secure and manage information and identities on any device or platform is resonating well with enterprises and consumers globally. We continue to gain traction with our long-term growth initiatives in the areas of cloud, computing, mobile and virtualization. In the December 2011 quarter, we continued to build momentum as we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of consistent execution. We generated better-than-expected revenue, earnings and deferred revenue results on a constant-currency basis. Our performance was driven by market share gains in Backup and strength in Enterprise Security, including DLP, Managed Security Services and Authentication. ", "Now let's take a closer look at some of the highlights from the quarter. Following on the strength of last year's December quarter results, our focused sales execution coupled with robust demand for our industry-leading products drove strong performance across all products and regions. We continue to cross-sell the product portfolio with 41% of our December quarter deals over $1 million, including sales from both of our Enterprise product segments, up from 38% in the year ago period. Our Backup business continues to gain market share. Growth in this business was driven by our unique ability to provide integrated deduplication, backup and virtualization solutions in a variety of form factors. Our investments to create industry-leading appliances are paying off as our Appliance business continues to exceed our expectations. ", "We have signed several large transactions with our NetBackup 5220 appliance, displacing established competitors. Our embedded V-Ray technology continues to differentiate us from the competition. Leading organizations such as FedEx and NBC Universal use NetBackup with V-Ray because of its ability to provide load-balanced, indexed and easily recoverable backups in both physical and virtual environments. ", "To further extend our lead in Information Management, we are bringing together our on-premise and cloud-based backup, archiving, eDiscovery and data security solutions. Due to the explosion of electronically stored information, customers are demanding a unified way to proactively classify, retain and discover information while reducing risk and avoiding costs. With tightened integration of our leading archiving and eDiscovery products, we will better protect information, establish retention policies and streamline the eDiscovery process. ", "Along with advanced technologies such as source and target deduplication our Backup Exec Appliance also includes critical system protection to protect the server from attacks. Our Enterprise Security business delivered strong double-digit results as we continue to extend our lead in Data Loss Prevention, Managed Security Services and Authentication. Competitor displacements drove ongoing stabilization in our Endpoint Security business. Customers are adopting SEP 12, 12.0, our best-in-class endpoint protection product, faster than previous versions, and it is already installed on more than 3 million endpoints. For the second year in a row, Symantec surpassed the other vendors, receiving the highest rating in both completeness of vision and ability to execute in the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection platforms. ", "Data Loss Prevention continued to outpace the market with double-digit growth driven by organizations needing to safeguard their intellectual property and prevent leakage of their critical data. Our Managed Security Services business closed its largest transaction ever with a global hospitality company, generating another quarter of strong double-digit growth. We're the only MSS provider that has received a top rating from Gartner in all 3 geographies. ", "Trust Services and User Authentication had a great quarter as we continue to displace our competitors. We increased our lead in both the premium and value SSL segments as we grew our install base by double-digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. According to Netcraft, Symantec has more active extended validation SSL certificates in use across the web than all other certificate authorities combined. Our user authentication solution, known as VIP, had another record quarter driven by solid execution across all geographies. We extended VIP's product leadership by adding intelligent authentication, which includes advanced security technologies such as system device fingerprinting, user behavior monitoring and geolocation monitoring. ", "Our storage and availability management business had a strong sales quarter driven by the successful release of Storage Foundation High Availability 6.0. Demand for centralized management across physical and virtual Linux, Windows and UNIX platforms was again a major driver of new sales. Today, Linux is the fastest-growing platform for our storage management software as an increasing number of customers are deploying Linux in their IT environments. We continue to partner with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate critical workloads into their private clouds.", "Our Consumer business generated its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, driven by our multichannel distribution strategy as well as our award-winning Norton products and services. Our 2012 Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security have won 54 awards to date, more than double that of the top 2 competitors combined. The high quality and performance of our 2012 products have helped us sign a new multiyear agreement with Lenovo to include Norton Internet Security on their Think-branded personal computers. New products and services continue to drive growth for our consumer business. Our online backup business delivered double-digit revenue growth as we continue to expand our go-to-market initiatives. ", "For household and small offices with mixed environments of PCs and Macs, NortonLive Ultimate Help Desk now supports Macs and provides customers with an easy-to-use support service. We continue to expand our partnerships with ISVs and ISPs, creating another channel for us to upsell our NortonLive solutions. Our cloud services business, known as Symantec.cloud, continue to deliver new value-added services, and we have broadened our distribution. During the quarter, a large public-sector customer in Europe with more than 450,000 users chose Symantec to build out their cloud services with improved security standards. We have also received positive feedback from customers and partners on our new Endpoint Protection and Backup Exec cloud-based solutions. In addition, our extended cloud portfolio -- in addition, we are extending our cloud portfolio with the acquisition of LiveOffice, a cloud-based archiving provider to offer customers a comprehensive information management solution delivered on-premise, in the cloud or as a hybrid solution. ", "Now turning our attention to our mobile offerings. We continue to add new capabilities to our mobile device management solutions to secure and manage smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices. To drive market share gains, we launched a set of services that help enterprises evaluate their mobile security needs and develop defenses against mobile threats and vulnerabilities. By leveraging Symantec's extensive knowledge base and technical expertise, customers can mitigate risks associated with mobile devices and mobile apps. We are also enhancing our mobile solutions for consumers. We announced new updates for Norton Mobile Security for the Android platform and the availability of our Norton Tablet Security. In addition to protecting against online threats, these offerings provide advanced antitheft capabilities to remotely lock and locate a lost or stolen device. Our Norton Mobile Security offering averaged 270,000 downloads per month, an increase of 50% from the previous quarter. We expanded our OEM partnership with LG to include Norton Mobile Security and Norton Tablet Security in their smartphones and their tablet devices. Consumers will also be able to download our Norton mobile solution from the Samsung App Store. Our ongoing focus on building device and platform-independent solutions as part of our Norton Everywhere initiative has positioned us well to protect consumers anywhere they go. ", "In conclusion, I am pleased with the solid results we delivered in the past 6 quarters, and I expect the momentum to continue. We have laid the foundation for a continued growth in fiscal year 2013. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. Our results were driven by growth across each of our primary business segments. Continued consistent execution drove record December quarter revenue and deferred revenue as well as double-digit earnings per share growth. GAAP revenue totaled $1.715 billion, an increase of 6% versus the December 2010 quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened by approximately 1% against the euro as compared to the year ago period. Overall, foreign currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by one percentage point, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 7%. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, revenue would have totaled approximately $1.721 billion, above our guided range. Year-to-date, revenue has grown 8% year-over-year. ", "December quarter license revenue declined 1% year-over-year, while content subscription and maintenance revenue grew 8% year-over-year. Year-to-date, license revenue is up 2% and maintenance revenue is up 9% year-over-year. Subscription sales, which are made up of our consumer, authentication and cloud services businesses, accounted for 39% of total revenue, up from 37% in the year ago period. In total, subscription revenue grew 13% year-over-year. Our subscription offerings represent an increasingly significant portion of our new business growth but are not included in our license revenue line. Continued subscription growth, combined with strong maintenance renewals, increased the proportion of December quarter revenue that came off the balance sheet to 70%, up from 67% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income of $314 million grew 15% and resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42, up 20% from the December 2010 period. Year-to-date, EPS has grown 16% year-over-year. ", "The Consumer business generated December quarter revenue of $525 million, up 5% year-over-year, and benefited from our continued success in selling new products and services to consumers. These new offerings grew 78% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the Consumer business in the December quarter. OEM placement fees were lower than we had originally forecast by $10 million, as our OEM partners shipped fewer PCs than expected. ", "Turning now to the Enterprise business. Solid sales execution continued again this quarter with large transaction counts hitting all-time highs. We generated a total of 674 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, up 24% year-over-year, and 135 transactions valued at more than $1 million each, up 14% year-over-year. Of our deals valued at more than $300,000, 78% included multiple products. ", "The Security and Compliance segment generated record revenue of $511 million, up 17% year-over-year. The successful release of SEP 12 drove another quarter of growth in our Endpoint Security business, while Data Loss Prevention and Managed Security Services continued to gain share, resulting in double-digit growth. The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $617 million, an increase of 3% as compared to the December 2010 quarter. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup, archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 10% year-over-year, driven by our differentiated deduplication and virtual machine protection features. We realized $14 million in revenue from our Clearwell acquisition, in line with our previously provided guidance for the quarter. Revenue from the Storage and Availability Management business was down 10% for the quarter and down 5% year-to-date, in line with our expectations. As Enrique mentioned, we're encouraged that our customers continue to acknowledge the strength of our products, as evidenced by our Storage Management business generating strong bookings during the December quarter. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, down 12% year-over-year but flat sequentially, as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. ", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.7% for the December 2011 quarter, up 40 basis points from the year ago period, reflecting the transition of our consulting services to specialized partners. However, offsetting increases in cost of goods spending were driven by the success of our Appliance business, which we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.2%, up 220 basis points compared to the December 2010 quarter driven by ongoing expense management, improved operating leverage through revenue growth and lower-than-expected OEM fees. ", "Cash flow from operating activities for the December quarter totaled $403 million. We have generated operating cash flow of $1.214 billion year-to-date, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We exited the December quarter with $2.38 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we utilized $220 million to repurchase 13 million of our shares at an average price of $16.69. 30% of our cash balance was onshore as we exited the December quarter. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and maintain our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. ", "GAAP deferred revenue at the end of December 2011 was $3.67 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In the month of December, the dollar appreciated 3% against the euro, negatively impacting our reported end-of-quarter deferred revenue balance. At our guided rate of $1.37 per euro, deferred revenue would have totaled approximately $3.716 billion, above our guided range. ", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the March 2012 quarter. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.37 and the end-of-period rate of $1.41 per euro in the March 2011 quarter. Our $1.30-per-euro assumption reflects a 5% decrease from our weighted average rate of $1.37 for the March 2011 quarter. As a result, foreign currency movements would decrease estimates both sequentially and year-over-year. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27.5% and a common stock equivalence total for the quarter of approximately 735 million shares. For the March 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion, as compared to revenue of $1.673 billion during the March 2011 quarter. We expect year-over-year revenue to be up 2.8% to 3.4% on an as-reported basis and 4.9% to 5.5% in constant currency. Approximately 69%, or $1.2 billion, of our March quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. ", "The Clearwell business is expected to contribute between $15 million and $17 million to our March quarter revenue. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.23 and $0.24 as compared to $0.22 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.41 and $0.42 as compared to $0.38 in the year ago period, up 8% to 10% on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.915 billion and $3.935 billion compared to $3.82 billion at the end of March 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 2.5% to 3.0% on an as-reported basis and 4.8% to 5.3% in constant currency. ", "In conclusion, we are pleased with our operational execution and the solid financial performance across the business. We will continue to focus on carefully managing our expenses while driving long-term growth. ", "And now I'll turn it back over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We will be presenting at the Stifel Conference on February 7 and at the Morgan Stanley Conference on February 29. We will be reporting our fiscal fourth quarter results on May 2. In addition, please save the date for our Vision User Conference on May 8 and 9 in Las Vegas and our Financial Analysts Day on May 24 in San Francisco. More information regarding registration for these events will be distributed later in the quarter. For a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit our Events calendar on the IR website. Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Enrique, your strong large-deal metrics would suggest Symantec is becoming increasingly strategic to customers. And as we enter a new calendar year, I'd imagine you have close discussions with CIOs at some of the world's largest organizations. So I'm hoping, can you comment on how you think budgets for security and storage are shaping up in 2012?", "Enrique T. Salem", "When you look at the underlying trends that drive that demand, storage continues to grow at a very rapid rate. This morning, we started to do some of the work around our NetBackup and Backup Exec launch. And in some of the comments that I made this morning, Brad, we talked about growth in storage being forecast for this year close to 50%, I think I said about 48% for the year. And when you look at that growth in storage, there continues to be demand for our solutions that help customers deduplicate, better manage that whole backup environment. When you look at the current demand for our backup appliances, that continues to be robust, given that growth in information. On the other side, some of the comments I made around the strength in DLP, Managed Security Services, it's clear that people need help thinking about how do they protect their information. So even as we look at all the different news about the economy and unemployment rates and so forth, there continues to be good demand for the range of our portfolio. And my expectation is that, given what I'm seeing, is that we'll continue into this year.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And, Enrique, just diving into Europe.  Flat this quarter, down from growing 2% last quarter. And I think last quarter you had said that you had achieved your internal plan, and I took that to mean on a bookings basis. I know Mediterranean regions were weak last quarter, but can you maybe just give us more insight to what's happening in the region and maybe even from a bookings perspective what you're seeing there?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Absolutely. So we saw strong bookings across all 5 regions in Europe. We did see a little bit of weakness in a couple of Mediterranean countries. But in general, across all of the regions, bookings were strong. I was actually, to be honest, pleasantly surprised with the strength that we saw across Europe on a bookings basis.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Enrique, you've talked about a number of Enterprise product releases that are starting to ripen here. As you think about those moving into your fiscal '13, how do you think about the balance between the license and the subscription growth? Do you expect that sort of balance to change at all as you focus on some new product cycles?", "Enrique T. Salem", "What you see happening in our business is that we're starting to get a lot more of our .cloud businesses growing at a faster rate than our on-premise offering. So when you look at .cloud, our VeriSign business, we definitely -- our MSS business, we continue to see real good growth in the subscription side of the business. Now with the new releases, of course, that will drive some new license growth. But my expectation as we look forward in this business is that subscriptions are actually going to grow faster than licenses, just given the mix and the move in the marketplace.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just sneak a quick follow-up here, probably for James. But it looks like that the currency is going to have about a $35 million headwind here in the March quarter if I did my math right. Do you have an equivalent impact to the earnings side?", "James Beer", "In terms of EPS, I would expect that we'd be seeing a headwind somewhere of the order of $0.02 to $0.03, in that trajectory.", "Operator", "And we'll go next John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Enrique, it looks like the Corporate Security business was really strong this quarter, but when I look -- I'm going to follow up to Brad's question on the storage. Because when you back out sort of the Clearwell stuff, it looks like storage was flattish again. And we saw some discontinuity from that business for several quarters, and then we saw some meaningful -- some strength for a couple of quarters, and in the last few, it's just sort of been flattish again, even with what you talk about sounds like a pretty exciting market. So if you help explain that and help to explain why we shouldn't be seeing a little bit more growth out of that on an organic basis.", "Enrique T. Salem", "When you look at the Core Storage Management business, what we saw in the quarter was strong bookings performance. And as you know, that takes time to roll into the P&L, into revenue. And so my expectation is that we are continuing to see improvements over the last 3 or 4 quarters in that business. I look at what's happening on the non-Solaris platforms. For example, on Red Hat and Linux, we definitely are seeing good demand for our products, and we're working very closely with both Red Hat and with VMware on how do we continue to extend the Storage Management business onto those platforms to increase our overall penetration. And I see that is a trend that's going to continue as we look forward.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So is it the Solaris business? I mean, because for a while there, it looks like Oracle was spending a lot more time and probably money on marketing their high-end Storage business or the Sun high-end Storage business. But it looked like maybe it was helping a little bit, but is that sort of falling a little bit by the wayside at this point?", "Enrique T. Salem", "What you see happening in the Solaris business is it's becoming a smaller percentage of our total business as the other platforms continue to grow. The moves towards the non-Solaris platforms is definitely, as a total percentage, just increasing every quarter for probably the last 8 quarters, if not longer, and I expect that trend to continue. And we've got a number of initiatives that should continue to accelerate that trend. So it's more that the percentage or mix of our business is changing away from Solaris. And definitely, this -- Solaris is not a growth platform for us.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I'm sorry, just one quick follow-up, because you said the bookings were strong, and that's good to hear. And, yes, we understand that oftentimes it's recognized ratably, but that's usually the maintenance. Is there something else going on, too, where you're just selling capacity deals and you're recognizing that over time versus like a licensed component upfront?", "James Beer", "No, nothing changing in terms of the types of deal constructs that we're entering into around storage management.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually Keith Weiss sitting in for Adam Holt. I was wondering if you can talk about margins for a little bit. Maybe start with your gross margin line. It sounds like a lot of the fast-growing growth initiatives are stuff like the Appliance business, the Managed Services business, .cloud, areas that perhaps are at lower gross margins than some of your more traditional businesses. How should we think about that gross margin line on a going-forward basis and as these elements start to really take off within your P&L?", "James Beer", "Yes. Well, as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, in the December quarter, the year-over-year benefit of the gross margin line percentage-wise is being driven by the fact that we have fewer consulting services activities this period, December, versus the year ago period. Now we're starting to get towards lapping that type of an effect. And so that will start to mitigate as a driver of gross margin in the coming quarters. Now going in the other direction, we've talked about the success of our Appliances business.  As we continue to ramp up the scale of that business, then that will tend to lower gross margins somewhat. So I think we'll probably be expecting to see a reversal of the gross margin trajectory driven by the success of the appliances.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And what impact will the services businesses have on that? Are those going to be an overall margin drag like the .cloud businesses and the managed services business?", "James Beer", "Well, at the operating line, the operating margin line, what we talked about back at Analyst Day now is that, as we continue to grow, scale these higher-growth, currently smaller businesses like MSS, hosted service offerings, then, yes, that will have something of an impact on margins. But obviously, we're very pleased as to the progress we've made in developing those businesses. We see a lot more growth opportunity in them coming down the track in the next few years. And so as we scale them, then their margin contribution will improve.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then maybe if I could get one follow-up in just on operating margins, particularly the impact from the consumer margins. You've seen some nice year-on-year improvements in consumer margins. You were talking about on the call earlier how weaker PC shipments had positively impacted or reduced your OEM fees. Going forward as we look into maybe past Q4 and going into the back half of 2012, some people, including ourselves, are expecting Windows 8 to come out. You have the possibility of the PC shipping cycle ramping back up. How should we be thinking about consumer margins and the impact on overall operating margins as we start to look out a quarter or 2 in a potentially better PC shipping environment?", "James Beer", "Well, in terms of the December quarter, we saw OEM fees down around $8 million year-over-year, so that's driving about 0.5 point of margin at the operating line. And I would expect directionally that type of an effect in the March quarter. Now beyond that, obviously hard to say exactly how PC unit shipments are going to respond to the various market forces that you're referring to in your question. But that's what we see for the immediate term.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just wondering, Enrique, if you could talk on the backup side. You have a couple things going on there. You have the new appliances. It's my understanding that your NetBackup business sort of -- or your Backup Exec business sort of runs with server unit shipments, which have been weakening. And you also mentioned share gains in that market, which the overall growth rate in that business wouldn't necessarily point to share gains. I'm wondering if you could just help kind of pick apart the drivers there and help us understand what's the headwind and what's the tailwind for you in that business.", "Enrique T. Salem", "When we look at the opportunity, it absolutely is focused on people rearchitecting how they do data protection. The volumes of data that are out there right now and the growth rate is not allowing people to successfully complete backup of all the critical data in a traditional way. So what they're having to do is drive rearchitecture, which is saying they have to use new technologies, such as deduplication. The second aspect that's driving it is, as they move to more virtualized servers, you're also seeing a need to use updated or new technologies that are more efficient at backing up a virtualized server. So you've got a rearchitecture going on in data protection. The other thing that's happening is, because data and information is so critical in so many different processes, you're also seeing people having the need to keep some of that data more accessible or online using technologies like archiving. And then lastly, because of the legal issues around the discovery process, you're seeing them have to add new techniques and methodologies around the discovery process. And by the way, this is being done now both on-premise and in the cloud. So you look at that, and what you've got is a real rearchitecture of how you think about data protection, Information Management and so forth, so that rearchitecture really creates, in my opinion, a tailwind for us as they think through how do they get ahead of this problem. When you think about the other side of it, obviously, what we do every day is we have to continue to drive innovation. And so a number of the new capabilities that we're delivering into the marketplace with the new Backup launch are that improved support for virtual environments, improved deduplication rates, doing deduplication everywhere, from the client to the data center. And so there's a lot of opportunity for innovation in that market, and so we're continuing to do that. The only thing that I think about is over time, and we've talked about this, is we are going to move to more appliances. Our Appliance business keeps doing very well, and that will put a little bit of pressure on our margins. And so it's just a different cost structure than an enterprise software license. But from a market health, from a competitive perspective on the capabilities that we have, I feel very good about that. And then the only thing, the only headwind that I'm worried about right now is really the -- with the pressure on the margins.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just on the PCs, on the consumer side, you mentioned the OEM fees down.  Just trying to get a sense, is your new business in the consumer space growing? I understand you guys have always been a great company at driving the installed base to higher-priced products and so forth and selling them services and so forth. But on the new business, is that a growth business right now? Or is the PC headwind just too big of a headwind to make that -- to allow that consumer business to attract more new business?", "James Beer", "Yes, I'd say that component of the consumer business is pretty close to the flat line.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, but flat new business is roughly what you're seeing?", "James Beer", "Yes, that's right.", "Enrique T. Salem", "And so the benefit that we're seeing, as you touched on it, is because of our ability to better target customers and with our new e-commerce platform and then also adding the new Services set, products like Online Backup, products like Ultimate Help Desk, they are absolutely being used and adopted. And that drove 2 percentage points of growth in consumer in the last quarter. And we -- as I look forward and I look to the next year and the following year, I expect that those new services will continue to drive an increasing percentage of the growth of that business.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Enrique, I just want to dig into just the go-to-market side here. Just want to get a sense of how you feel about just a direct sales productivity but also just a word of where you guys stand in terms of just channels, partnerships and if there's anything we should look at going forward to improve that. And then also just along the lines, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on this call just on OEM fees and cost of service. But when you think about driving leverage long term in this model, where should, call it the OpEx as a percentage of revenue come down the most? Is it in sales as productivity improves? R&D? G&A? How should we think about that?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Sure. Let's start with the first part. When we look at the sales force and sales productivity, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the Enterprise segments. When I look at the large deal productivity, the metric -- I think James gave 135 deals over $1 million. When I look at the cross-selling, where 41% of the deals include products from both our security business and our Storage and Server Management business, we absolutely are being able to articulate a vision that says to customers the range of our products can help you deal with your information growth and information security problems. And so sales force productivity has continued to improve over the last 3 years. At the last Analyst Day, Bill Robbins talked about some metrics around expense to bookings, expense to billings, and my expectation is that, that metric should continue to improve, not just this year, but again next year. And I expect that to continue the year after that. And so as you know, we've been working over, I would say, probably the last 5 years to continue to improve that metric, and I expect it to continue. So now, coming into your second part of your question, some of the improvements in expansion and margin will come from continued improvements in sales, but I actually believe we'll see improvements across all parts of the business. I think there's improvements in every line of the P&L, and that gives me great confidence that over the next several years, we'll continue to be able to drive margin improvement each year. Obviously, I want to make sure that some of the improvement comes from top line growth, but we're absolutely going to drive better cost management, cost containment, which we've been doing over the last several years, and I expect that to continue.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Enrique, the number of deals over $300,000 has accelerated every quarter as a growth rate. And I'm just curious, are you seeing longer-term Enterprise agreements getting signed where, to your point, they're staying in [ph] 41% from both sides? But are you now locking customers up for longer periods and therefore giving you much better revenue visibility going forward as well?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Brent, I haven't seen a change in the length of the contracts that we're signing. I think it stayed pretty consistent over the last several quarters. What you are seeing, as we increase the deals at all of the metrics, we gave $300,000 and $1 million, is you are seeing us be able to bring more of the portfolio into each of those agreements. And my expectation, now that we've brought in technologies like Clearwell and LiveOffice, for example, when we are selling a backup solution or an archiving solution, my expectation is that we'll actually be able to sell a much broader set of capabilities. And so that would put upward pressure on our deal size.  Because instead of just buying Archiving, we're going to show you a compelling reason why you should buy our Archiving and our Discovery. And now we've got the market-leading Discovery technology that makes it a easier or a better discussion. And as we further integrate eDiscovery with archiving and backup, I expect that will just make it even better from a large-deal metric perspective.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Enrique, if you could just bring us up to speed on the storage market, just the competitive dynamics you're seeing in some of these new technologies that are coming to market, how that's changing your approach.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Brent, when you think about storage, are you thinking the Storage and Availability Management or the Backup side? How do you...", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Storage.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Okay, what we're seeing in Storage is the continued move to virtualization and the continued move to people looking at the Linux platform and moving mission-critical workloads onto the Linux platform. So our expectation is, as we bring some of the new technologies that do high availability on a virtualized environment, like our AppHA, that will continue to gain traction in the marketplace. When they move to non-Solaris platforms, what's happening is they're still relying on us for the robust and the high availability. And so I expect that, that will continue. As far as new technologies, we're at the forefront of file system performance, at the forefront of clustering technologies. We're showing people right now how they can more effectively build their private clouds using our technology. I was just in our Executive briefing center yesterday, and one of the things that's resonating very well with customers is we're saying, \"Look, use the existing infrastructure you have, your storage infrastructure, your computing infrastructure more effectively.\" When you're trying to build that private cloud, what you're really trying to do is get better utilization of all of your IT resources, not just your hardware assets, but also your people assets. And so using our technologies, we're able to show customers how we use the file system and clustering technologies to build out that private cloud in a highly scalable, highly cost-effective way. And so we absolutely believe that we're positioning ourselves well as people try to build out their private cloud infrastructure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.", "Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just starting out with the DLP business, can you give us a little bit more color on how that performed this quarter and maybe where you see the opportunity for that to grow as a portion of the business over time?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes. What we see is that the DLP business has been a catalyst for building our relationship with the CISOs. If you look at the product portfolio, products like control compliance were also helping us there. But DLP has changed the relationship that we have with the CISO, because that information that they get from their DLP product is being shared broadly with the minds of business leaders so that they understand the risks and the exposure that a business has. So my expectation is that DLP will be used broadly across the enterprise, and it will also start moving below what I would call the Large Enterprise segment into the Enterprise segment and, potentially, the higher end of the mid-market. The other thing that we're doing with DLP this quarter is we're delivering our DLP for tablets, which has been in very high demand because people are using more. I think you saw yesterday in iPad numbers where I think there were 15 million iPads sold in the December quarter, and a number of those iPads end up in the enterprise. And so customers are absolutely looking forward to the ability to use our DLP technology on their tablet devices. As far as the other part of your question, James, do you want to talk about the...", "James Beer", "Well, in terms of revenue growth, DLP had another good double-digit year-over-year growth quarter.", "Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Fantastic. Just talking a little bit about the Clearwell acquisition and integration efforts with your existing solutions, are you seeing more demand for these suite-based solutions? And is there anybody else out there that can potentially offer something competitive? Or do you think this is a real opportunity for you guys to offer a solution-based approach to really dominate the segment?", "Enrique T. Salem", "What customers tell me all the time is they don't want to be systems integrators. They want Symantec to deliver integrated solutions. And the more we can build the complete offering in data protection, the more interest and demand we get. And that's why we're seeing such good performance from our Appliance business, because customer previously were buying the backup software, they were buying deduplication hardware and they were buying the media server, all separately. What we're able to do with our 5240 appliances is integrate all of that. So then when you extend it to the other components of our data protection suite, our goal is to continue to bring in the other components. We absolutely have differentiated technology date [ph]. Clearwell is the market leader in eDiscovery; LiveOffice, best-in-class, hosted archiving technology; NetBackup, market leader in backup software. We put all that together in one integrated solution, I think you're absolutely right, that should start distancing us from the competition, because no one has the market-leading, best-of-breed technologies in the different areas that I've described. And so I'm very bullish on the prospects for all of our data protection capabilities. And as we further integrate them, I think that business will continue to perform very well for us.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Enrique, just as you look at the consumer business and obviously the consumer PC shipment numbers that are out there, obviously, it looks like there's another quarter or 2 as we try to rebuild the inventory. Can you talk to us how you see the kind of the next 6 to 9 months performing in the consumer business and how we should think about that trending?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Obviously, we're keeping an eye on what's happening with the supply chain in the PC marketplace, which is just another headwind in the overall PC growth rate. I absolutely don't expect any kind of turnaround in PC shipments until we get through probably to the Windows 8 launch. And what we're always doing, then, is saying how do we continue to build our business so that it's less dependent on the numbers of PC units that are being shipped? And that's been something that's not a new process for Symantec. It's something that we've been working on for some time. And so we continue to add new services. We're reviewing proposals for some of the new capabilities. I commented that we're seeing more and more downloads of our Norton Mobile Security for Android. And so my expectation is that the core PC software side is going to benefit for our ability to cross-sell other components of our portfolio, upsell to the higher price points. But I don't expect that -- as James commented on a previous question, I don't expect to see an uptick in PC units, and so new customer acquisition will be relatively stable. I expect the opportunity to be in these other services as we go beyond the PC. So my expectation is we'll continue to track the consumer business, definitely a headwind in PCs, definitely a headwind on the -- in the -- going beyond the PC and a headwind because of the supply chain.  But I think we just need to continue to build our business around some of the other new services that the consumer businesses continue to add.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe as a follow-up for James. James, could you help us out a little bit on the tax rate further out? I know you mentioned for next quarter, 27.5%. I think more or less, the street's a little bit higher from a tax rate perspective as we look out. I mean, do you think that tax rates stay stable around the 27.5%? Or do you think it will be ticking up going forward?", "James Beer", "Well, directionally, we think of the tax rate at around 28%, a little bit north of that. And then there are obviously different onetime items that tend to come up each quarter that land us on the published rate along with each quarterly set of results. So I wouldn't expect any change from that sort of 28%, 28.5% type base rate, if you will.", "Operator", "We will go next to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Chaitanya Yaramada sitting in for Steve Ashley. So the SEP 12 looks to have been a successful launch. Could you provide some color maybe around the actual revenue or bookings growth during the quarter? And how much of the business is tied to Enterprise? Was this mid and small business? And any color on the uptake? And maybe any difference in the uptake of the product in each of the segments would be helpful.", "Enrique T. Salem", "You're absolutely right on how well SEP is doing. I mean, 3 million people have already installed it. It's the best adoption we've seen. The team, quite frankly, hit the ball out of the park with the quality of this release, and so I couldn't be happier. And the feedback I've reported over the last several quarters initially came from our partners, and now it's coming from customers, where that product is absolutely the best-in-class anti-malware protection product on the market. So our team did a great job there. What we're also seeing, though, is, and I've commented that given the work to integrate McAfee into Intel, we're also seeing opportunity to displace and gain share across segments against McAfee. And so we're feeling very encouraged by that. I don't know that we -- we don't break out the Endpoint Security business revenue, but what I am seeing is very good improvement in that business where it was flat to declining previously. And we're definitely seeing a more stability and growth in that business as a result of the last couple of quarters. And so I expect that to continue, and I'm confident that the new product is really the best product on the market.", "James Beer", "Just one other fact in service of the adoption of SEP 12. This time a quarter ago, we had 1.3 million installations. As Enrique says, now we're over 3 million. So it's a fast acceleration rate.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And any comments on the take-up in the SMB market?", "Enrique T. Salem", "We definitely see opportunity there. As you know, we created a new group focused on this segment. We are driving a number of new initiatives. One of the most encouraging components of that segment is not just the on premise, but the opportunity with our Symantec Endpoint Protection .cloud business where we're seeing it easier for customers to use that product in that segment. And so my expectation is we're going to continue to see improvements over the next several quarters on a bookings basis in the SMB segment. The focus, the product and the flexibility that we offer with .cloud I think is going to bode well for that business.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Enrique, sticking on -- you just mentioned McAfee and some market share dynamics. Can you expand a little bit about what's happening on the consumer front.  Potentially some new commerce could be making it to the public markets soon. What's happening on that front? Any change?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Shaul, say the last part of your question, any change with the public market...", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "With -- kind of with market dynamics on the consumer front.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes. I would tell you that what we see is, our core business and the new products, again, this is something we'd -- as we drive the consistency in execution, what we're seeing is better products and better sales execution. And ultimately, I am convinced that our Norton products, the 2012 products, are the absolute best products on the market. So what that does is that starts having a positive effect not only on how do we bring customers in, but also on keeping customers happy. And we look at the metrics from what we call our customer loyalty or Net Promoter Score, and that business continues to lead the pack as far as the best customer loyalty. Now you are seeing the continued move at the lower end of the market to what we call the freemium, from freemium vendors. And they continue to be out there. I would tell you that, as I look at data that we have available, some of those vendors are struggling with some of their monetization models, and I expect that they're going to continue to struggle going forward, because their business model is going to get challenged as they try to upsell to some of the services, because we've got a better market position with better services, and I'm convinced that we'll be able to effectively compete with anybody who is offering a freemium product. As you know, there's probably a couple of them that are going to try to go public, and it will be interesting to see.  As they disclose how they're generating revenue, and some of them already have, I think it will become pretty clear that there's going to be some headwinds that they're going to face going forward, and I think we're going to be a driver of some of those headwinds.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "James, quickly on the cash flow, healthy at $403 million, but I think kind of slightly below what the street was expecting. Is that kind of timing -- that's a timing reason?", "James Beer", "Yes. Obviously, cash flow tends to be more volatile between one period or another. The last few quarters, we've been comfortably ahead. And so that's just particularly why I reemphasize year-to-date cash flow from operations having grown 10%.", "Helyn Corcos", "Gwen, that was -- I think that's all the time we have at this point.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Enrique Salem for closing remarks.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Well, I'm pleased with our team's execution and solid results for the sixth consecutive quarter. Thank you for joining us this afternoon, and I definitely look forward to speaking with you again soon.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 financial results. With me today are Enrique Salem, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Enrique. He will discuss Symantec's execution during the quarter and the fiscal year. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as a review of our guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental information are posted on the website, and a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website shortly after the call is completed. ", "Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the March quarter 2012, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.31 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.33 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.30 per euro. For the March 2011 quarter, the actual weighted average rate was $1.37 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.41 per euro. ", "We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on our website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangible and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now I would like introduce our CEO, Mr. Enrique Salem.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced last week, our fourth quarter in-period revenue was weaker than expected, driven by fewer license rich deals and a shift in our revenue mix toward subscriptions. Our fourth quarter bookings, however, exceeded our internal plans and the underlying billings activity came in line with our expectations. This resulted in greater billings going to the balance sheet, driving stronger-than-expected deferred revenue. Despite the March quarter results, fiscal year 2012 was a record year for Symantec. We executed on our strategy to strengthen our core businesses, while continuing to grow our emerging businesses. We laid the foundation to capitalize on key growth initiatives in Cloud, Mobile and Virtualization. We developed a number of important innovative technologies that support our strategy. We expanded our portfolio of SaaS-delivered solutions and recently launched 03, our new security service for the cloud. We also introduced multiple mobile application and device management solutions and DLP for tablets. Furthermore, we strengthened our partnership with VMware to provide storage solutions that facilitate virtualization of critical applications. ", "In our core businesses, we launched the best performing Enterprise Endpoint Protection product according to industry analysts. We successfully released our Backup Appliances with better-than-expected results and launched the industry's first membership offering for consumer security. We are continuing to make progress in penetrating the SMB segment, where there's more opportunity to grow. We successfully reversed the downward trend in our core Enterprise Endpoint Security business, which saw its third consecutive quarter of bookings growth, driven by SEP 12's award-winning product launch. ", "Our Trust Services business also performed well. This is a market many believed to be in decline when we bought it, yet the team's focused execution has driven growth and share gains across both the premium and value segments of the certificate market. ", "Our emerging businesses contributed to bookings growth during the fiscal year 2012. User Authentication, designed to protect identities, had another record quarter. Managed Security Services continued to gain share as customers relied on our security expertise to help them deal with the targeted threat environment. We simplified our pricing structure, which has both streamlined the buying process for our customers and improved our margins through better alignment of cost and value. We signed a number of new MSS contracts across geographies, highlighted by an important win at a major German bank. Our SaaS security services also grew as cloud delivery is increasingly the preferred solution for mail and web security. ", "As all of these growth drivers are subscription offerings, sales go to the balance sheet and will be recognized as revenue in the coming quarters. In the fourth quarter, we laid the foundation for both our Cloud and Mobile solutions. In order to help customers with the key trend of \"Bring Your Own Device,\" we acquired 2 mobile companies to round out our capabilities. Being able to offer customers mobile device and application management allows employees to use their personal devices in the workplace without having to compromise security or the native user experience. We also launched Phase I of 03, our Identity and Access Control service, enabling single sign-on for third-party cloud applications. We have received positive early responses to this service from a variety of customers. ", "With storage costs making up 17% of IT budget according to Forrester, it becomes increasingly important for organizations to manage their data in more efficient ways. Symantec enables customers to use virtualization technologies and the cloud to lower IT costs and confidently back up, recover, archive and discover information. Our Information Management products protect and archive physical and virtual machines, using integrated market-leading capabilities. During the year, we strengthened our partnership with VMware. We developed innovative technologies, such as V-Ray, and provided advanced capability for source and for target deduplication. In addition, we successfully delivered industry-leading Backup Appliances, which have driven incremental new business and have displaced established competitors. ", "In the fourth quarter, we refreshed our Backup products for the Enterprise and SMB segments. We differentiated ourselves by providing up to 100X faster backup speed and integrating with NetApp Snapshots. We leveraged our unique technologies across multiple delivery models, including cloud, fully integrated appliances and traditional on-premise software. We will continue driving the penetration of our appliances into new and developed markets, integrating our complementary eDiscovery and archiving capabilities and cross-selling these higher-growth businesses into our installed base. ", "Our Storage Management business received several large renewals from top Telco and financial sector customers, reiterating our customers' commitment to these products and the value of these relationships. Our large Storage Management customers use both our Backup and Storage Management products to better protect and manage their information. We will continue to expand our partnerships with Red Hat and VMware to help customers migrate business-critical workloads into their private clouds. The increasing momentum towards the Linux platform and data center modernization will continue to be the primary opportunity drivers going forward. This business generates an important source of cash and profits for the company. ", "Our consumer business generated its 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We maintained our consumer security leadership during the global decline in PC shipments that was felt most acutely in the developed markets, where the attach rates are much higher than in the emerging markets. In our beyond-the-PC offerings, our cloud backup solution and NortonLive Services continue to generate strong growth. Norton Online Backup now has 14 million users. This solution is an important part of our consumer protection portfolio and has proven to be an important driver of our renewals. Our smartphone and tablet solution, Norton Mobile Security, is also available as an app in the Android market and has received a 4.3 star rating. Today's consumer accesses information on a broader array of devices than the PC. Our recently launched Norton One service enables this trend by ensuring information protection moves with the consumer. Norton One, the industry's first membership offering, represents a new paradigm in consumer information protection. This premium service provides comprehensive protection across multiple devices, backed with a personalized experience and dedicated support, all managed through a single cloud-based interface. ", "In conclusion, while I'm disappointed with the lower-than-expected revenue results in the fourth quarter, I am pleased with the 9% revenue growth we delivered in fiscal year 2012. We will continue to focus on strengthening our core businesses and growing our emerging opportunities. We are excited about the roadmap for fiscal year 2013 and have many of the foundational elements in place to grow our business. This is the overriding focus of our team as we move ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results.", "James Beer", "Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon. As we discussed on our preliminary update call last week, our bookings activity met our expectations for the fourth quarter, but a year-over-year decline of 26% in license sales and a larger percentage of ratable subscription sales, caused revenue and EPS to come in below our expectations. The higher subscription sales caused more of our billings activity to be recorded on the balance sheet, resulting in a higher deferred revenue balance. For fiscal year 2012, we reported record results for each of our key financial metrics and across all of our geographies. This performance was driven by strength in our Backup, SaaS, DLP and Managed Security Service offerings, as well as the results of our recently acquired businesses. ", "First, I'll review the financial results of our fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011. As-reported revenue grew 9% and reached a record $6.73 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue grew 6%. Acquisitions accounted for $54 million in revenue, resulting in 1% organic constant currency growth for fiscal 2012. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 7%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 3%. Subscription revenue grew 15% and accounted for 43% of total revenue compared to 39% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Enterprise subscriptions grew 40% and accounted for 12% of total revenue as compared to 9% of revenue in the prior year. International revenue grew 7% to $3.49 billion and represented 52% of total revenue. The Americas grew 7%; Asia Pacific, including Japan, grew 14%; and the Europe/Middle East/Africa region grew 1%. As a result of our billings performance, we exited the year with a record $3.97 billion in deferred revenue, up 5%. ", "Our non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2% was down 20 basis points and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 13% to $1.61. We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, up 6% from fiscal 2011 on an as-reported basis. Capital expenditures totaled $286 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.615 billion for the fiscal year. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance totaled $3.2 billion, with approximately 28% of this amount residing onshore. During the year, we spent $893 million to repurchase 51 million shares at an average share price of $17.62, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 6.5% or a net 4.3%, after adjusting for the issuance of employee stock compensation. ", "Now I'll review the financial details of the March 2012 quarter compared to the March 2011 period. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year and totaled $1.681 billion. Clearwell generated revenue of $13 million, below what we were expecting due to increased competitive pricing in the eDiscovery litigation service provider channel. LiveOffice generated $4 million in revenue, coming in better than planned. For the fourth quarter, our organic constant currency revenue declined 2% year-over-year. As we mentioned last week, license revenue declined 26% year-over-year, in part as a result of record license sales in the year-ago period and the continuing shift towards subscription-based products and services. Content and maintenance revenue continued to grow steadily, increasing 4% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 10% and accounted for 41% of total revenue, up from 38% in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscription sales grew 30% year-over-year. Across the Enterprise business, we closed a total of 487 transactions valued at more than $300,000 each, approximately equal to the number in the year-ago period, and 128 of these transactions generated more than $1 million of bookings, up 7% year-over-year. The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year, driven by strength in MSS, SaaS and Authentication Services. Our Endpoint Security business also grew for the third consecutive quarter. The Storage and Server Management segment decreased 5% as compared to the March 2011 quarter, driven by weakness in our Storage Management business and a pause in sales before the launch of our new Backup Exec product. Revenue from our backup, archiving and eDiscovery business was down 3% year-over-year, but our newly launched Appliance business continues to exceed expectations, more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. ", "Revenue from our Storage Management business decreased 8% year-over-year, driven by lower license sales than in the year-ago period. The consumer business was up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our new cloud and service offerings, as well as improving renewal rates in the core business. The new service offerings grew 54% year-over-year and accounted for 2 percentage points of revenue growth. OEM placement fees were greater than our forecast by $5.4 million, as our OEM partners shipped more units than they had originally forecasted. For the June quarter, we expect PC shipments to increase as our OEM partners ship more units into emerging countries, which have lower software attach rates. ", "Our Services business generated revenue of $64 million as we continued to transition our consulting practice to specialized partners. GAAP operating margin for our Services segment was 17% as compared to 7% in the March 2011 quarter. ", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6% for the March 2012 quarter, down 110 basis points year-over-year on increasing appliance and SaaS sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2%, down 210 basis points year-over-year, driven by weaker-than-expected revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%, below our guidance of 27%, due to several onetime items being resolved favorably during the quarter. ", "We generated another quarter of strong operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $687 million. During the quarter, we spent $200 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares at an average price of $17.88. ", "We are reaffirming the guidance we provided last week. We are assuming an exchange rate of $1.32 per euro, a decrease of 8% versus the weighted average rate of $1.44 and the end-of-period rate of $1.45 per euro from the June 2011 quarter. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 27% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 725 million shares. Thus, for the June 2012 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.66 billion as compared to revenue of $1.653 billion during the June 2011 quarter. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to be up 2.4% to 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. We expect Clearwell and LiveOffice to generate combined revenue between $11 million and $15 million in the June period. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.18 and $0.19, as compared to $0.25 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.37 and $0.38, as compared to $0.40 in the year-ago period, down 1.5% to up 1% after adjusting for currency. GAAP-deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.715 billion and $3.735 billion, compared to $3.689 billion at the end of June 2011. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up between 2.8% and 3.4% in constant currency. 74% or $1.23 billion of our June quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. This is the highest deferred revenue rolloff percentage we've seen to date. ", "In conclusion, although our recognized revenue was weaker than we expected in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong bookings performance generated in fiscal year 2012. We remain focused on consistent execution and managing our expenses judiciously to drive top line organic growth in the coming fiscal year. And now I'll turn it back to Helyn to begin polling for your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on a few upcoming events. We will be hosting our Financial Analyst Day on Thursday, May 24, in San Francisco. Please note that registration is required to attend the event. In addition, we'll be presenting at the JPMorgan Conference on May 15 and at the Cowen Conference on May 31. Lastly, we will be reporting our fiscal first quarter results on July 25. For a complete list of our investor-related events, please visit our Events Calendar on the IR website. Operator, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "And that question will come from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Two quick questions. One, just on the Enterprise subscription metric you gave, you noted stronger growth there versus licensing. How should we expect that trend over the next year? And then secondly, if you could just walk through -- clearly the Storage business came out a little bit lower than your expectation and the margin was down about 1,000 basis points year-on-year. Can you give us a sense of where you think the margins should restabilize back on the Storage side?", "James Beer", "Well, in terms of the Enterprise subscription growth rate, I talked about 30% up year-over-year. That is seeing the rolling off benefit of the VeriSign acquisition, so the SSL business is obviously a large portion of that total Enterprise subscription amount. So as the quarters go by, I would expect that to normalize more in-line with the true organic blended rate of the SSL business with the higher organic growth rates of the other of our subscription services businesses. So I would expect it to come down somewhat over time. In terms of the margin around the Storage Management side of the business, I would certainly expect the Backup performance to be improving in coming quarters. We talked in our remarks about something of a pause around Backup Exec prior to the release of that new offering. We also have a new version of NetBackup into the marketplace. And so as those license-oriented sales rise, I would expect margins to rise as well versus what we recorded in the March quarter.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Enrique, clearly there are a lot of good things happening at Symantec, but investors I've spoken to over the past week are trying to better understand your comments that the company met its internal plan in Q4, despite having missed your combined guidance for revenue and deferred revenue. Can you help us better understand what metrics you're managing to internally and how they deviate from reported revenue and deferred revenue that we see in your financials?", "Enrique T. Salem", "The metric we use is -- we look at total Enterprise bookings for the quarter, was the number that I'm referring to, Brad. And when you look at that blend, what you end up with is, we are looking at the combination of what gets -- what's in revenue, what's in deferred revenue. And as we book longer-term deals, so, for example, our cloud-based services, we look at the total contract value, a commitment over a 3-year period. So for example, we give credit for somebody who closes a 3-year .cloud deal; that's 3 years worth of credit. And so it's important to note that some of the bookings are not going to show up in revenue and deferred revenue. They're actually going to show up in years 2 and 3. That's also the case for MSS and a couple of our other businesses. So it's just the total activity, because what we're trying to do is get customers to commit to longer subscriptions with us, and that's been our practice over the years, Brad.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "That's very helpful, Enrique. And if I could follow up, James, how did consumer bookings in the fourth quarter measure up against what you'd expected when you originally gave fourth quarter guidance? And can you maybe compare your consumer bookings result versus Enterprise bookings in terms of how much each deviated from plan?", "James Beer", "Well, the Enterprise bookings are, obviously, going to be very much back-end loaded right towards the last week or 2 of the quarter. And those Enterprise bookings drive the volatility that we saw -- the lower Enterprise revenue that we saw, driven by that mix shift away from traditional license to more subscription activity that we've been talking about. Now the consumer side of the business has obviously a very different profile in terms of the way the bookings build during the quarter. It's a much more linear approach throughout the quarter. So the consumer business came in close to where we would have expected it to be. The Enterprise business actually beat on the bookings, but those bookings translated through into fewer recognized revenue dollars in period.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's good that you guys give us a lot of information. I think it's good sometimes that we can ask questions like this next one I'm going to ask on storage. It's sort of a follow-up to Brad's question. Storage is down 5% on a constant-currency basis and I would assume that the maintenance renewal rates for Storage are actually pretty good. But -- and when I think of pretty good, I think for Enterprise maintenance renewal rates are in the 90s. That's sort of best in class, and that's why I would think you're in for that. But down 5%, that, even if -- let's say a 95% renewal rate, that means year-over-year, you didn't sign any licenses. Zero. And if it was all maintenance that you signed a year ago, that would be down 5%. So either maintenance renewals are actually going down in that business, which, actually, I'm not sure why that would happen because these are people that have installed Veritas or Symantec Storage, and/or license is just negligible here. And I don't know, if you can help shine a little more light on this. Because as a leader in Storage software, both in storage backup and in Storage Management, even if existing customers are just buying new capacity as they grow, I would think that, that should grow a little bit. And just -- in the market itself, it appears to be growing a little. Just kind of shocking to see those numbers. If you can sort of address that.", "Enrique T. Salem", "John is -- you're doing analysis, and -- let me give you a little bit more color that I think will be helpful. When you look at the overall Storage Management business, that is where we've seen the decline that is driving the shortfall that you're describing. And specifically, that segment is down 8% in what we call the Storage Management area, not the Backup and recovery part of SSMG. The other thing that's important to note here, that we shouldn't overlook -- we've been doing a lot of work on the HP-UX platform, and that is a reseller OEM agreement that is coming directly through HP, and so we saw a little bit of slowdown in those billings. And so the growth opportunity for us in Storage Management is really in 2 areas: one, around virtualization, as people start using technologies like Application HA to make their VMs higher availability; and then the second is the continued move and adoption of Linux, specifically, Red Hat. And so you're seeing a headwind in that business on some of the more traditional platforms and some opportunities around the new platforms of virtualization and Linux.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. So everything...", "James Beer", "To emphasize the strength of the renewal rates, as you alluded to, John, in the way you framed the question, we have strong renewal rates in those businesses and I was pleased with the continued growth of the maintenance line within our P&L results.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But -- and that makes sense, James, but I think the backup business, as you -- when you first spoke in the prepared remarks, was actually down 3% too. And I just -- I mean -- and if the renewal rates are high, you must not be -- and some people, I guess, are adding some kind of -- and this is my follow-up, I won't ask another one, are adding some capacity. Are you renewing maintenance contracts at significant discounts. Maybe the renewal rate's high, but you're just discounting the renewals?", "James Beer", "You see the -- certainly, the driver of the revenue result for the March quarter was that 26% decline in license revenue. Now both the backup and Storage Management businesses can be relatively license rich and we've talked in the past about how we saw fewer big deals in the March quarter than was the case a year ago. So it was very much the result of a lower volume of these bigger deals, driving fewer backup and Storage Management licenses that drove the revenue result. The renewal rate's continuing to build very nicely.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Aaron. You had talked about how you sort of met or exceeded your billings and bookings growth for the quarter, and presumably the year. And if we look at that in the context of your cash flow growth going forward, I know you're not guiding on an annual basis, but given that the billings and bookings growth, is there any reason why cash flow should not continue to grow in sort of that mid-single-digit growth rate, sort of putting aside the shift between the income statement and the balance sheet on the bookings?", "James Beer", "Yes, I think, directionally, you'll continue to see cash flow growth growing in-line with our operating profit growth.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, terrific. And then on the revenue guidance, if we look at it, I mean, you get about a negative -- at the midpoint here, 2.5 or 2.7 point hit from currency. If we factor that in, can you just talk about sort of your expectations in the June quarter for the different business segments in terms of your guidance here, would you expect the Storage Management business to continue to be weak here? Do you think the backup products should reaccelerate in the June quarter on the heels of the release, or does that take a couple of quarters? Maybe you could just walk through some of the segments in terms of how they should line up in the June quarter?", "Enrique T. Salem", "I would -- if you look at it by segment, I think you'll see our file system business continue to be at roughly the levels, with some of the continued weakness there. But when you look at Backup, specifically products like Backup Exec, our expectation is that they will start to pick up in the June quarter. With NetBackup, that will take a little bit longer as it's a larger Enterprise sale. But we do expect, for example, our appliances to continue to do very well. When you look at the Enterprise Security business, given the refresh of SEP 12 that we've done, continuing improvements in the Small Business segment, we also expect Enterprise Security to be strong in the June quarter. So that's how we'd look at it across the Storage business, the backup business and the Enterprise Security business.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just have a question on margins. If I can just sort of back into your sort of implied margin for Q1 here. It's a pretty solid drop year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, and -- I mean, how should we just think about margins and just, I guess, what your OpEx and your COGS, your spending plans are relative to revenue? Because if fiscal '12 is relatively flattish year-over-year despite the fact that you have the benefit of sort of the right backup of the VeriSign deferred revenue over the course of the year versus fiscal '11 and now in Q1, margin is down and I'll call it 300-ish plus basis points -- I mean, how do you think about these 2? Because if the bookings and the revenue growth's not there, basically you have to have the revenue growth to expand margins from here? Or how do you just plan on OpEx?", "James Beer", "Well, the emphasis of our spending is very much tilted, again, in the coming fiscal year towards the higher-growth opportunities that we're seeing in the market. And those are areas like appliances, areas like the Hosted Services, the other subscription types of services that we've been discussing, and those are coming with lower margins. We absolutely think that we can drive contribution, operating profit increases as a result of growing those businesses. But there'll be some impact on margins as we scale these higher growths today, smaller parts of our overall business. At the same time, as we look to continue to grow the core, that will tend to support operating margins. So it's a balance between continued growth of the core, which will translate through quickly to operating margin improvement versus growth of these lower-margin, higher-growth opportunity subscription and appliance opportunity areas.", "Operator", "And moving on to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually Keith Weiss sitting in for Adam Holt. On that note around margins, you guys did see a nice pickup on a year-on-basis, in your Security and Compliance margins, although the date is off a little bit from last quarter. Given that kind of mix that you're talking about, James, of the new and emerging businesses -- it seems like a lot of them are in the Security and Compliance business -- should we expect continued margin improvement in that business or is that an area that's going to really necessitate a lot of investments, and that should not be in our expectations on a go-forward basis?", "James Beer", "Well, we've been pleased by how the margins have expanded within Security and Compliance. Obviously, you've got products in that business unit like DLP and encryption. So those are more of the traditional type of license type sales and those, as we've discussed for several quarters now, have been coming along nicely. So they've tended to support margins in that business unit. You also see the impact of our authentication business, so the larger part of authentication is the server authentication at the sale business. And so the Security and Compliance business unit is continuing to benefit from the acquisition effects, and so that has been supporting margins in S&C as well. Now going in the other direction, you have much of our Hosted Services offerings within that business unit. We think that they'll continue to expand, and those come at a lower margin. So it'll, again, somewhat akin to my earlier answer, it will be a balance of those types of factors that will drive to the eventual margin result.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then on the Consumer Business, you guys actually sustained margins there as well, despite the, I believe you said a $5.4 million additional OEM expense from product unit shipments. Where's the offset to that $5.4 million coming? Where are you guys still seeing additional margin improvements in that Consumer Business?", "James Beer", "Well, we're obviously pleased by the continuing growth of the top line. I mean, that's where it all starts and there, it's very much the new services backup, the live services, that have been continuing to grow nicely, and we've been pleased. We talked on one of our earlier answers about the strong renewal rates on the Enterprise side of the business. The renewal rates have been strong -- getting stronger on the Consumer side. So the top line has been helping out the margin and we've been obviously working the expense equation as well judiciously.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, stepping back a bit on the shift to subscription. When you guys look forward, do you expect this kind of shift to subscription to continue at this pace? Do you expect it to decelerate or accelerate? And is there anything you're doing from a comp plan perspective to influence that? That's my first question. And then a follow-up question will be on Clearwell and LiveOffice. The guidance embeds a pretty low number there. Is there anything going on with the integration there that we should be aware of, or is it just conservatism?", "Enrique T. Salem", "On the first question, our expectations are that customers are going to continue to move to more cloud-delivered and subscription-based businesses. I mean, the 2 standout performers there have been -- for the fiscal year, have been our .cloud services and our Managed Security Service business, because people are absolutely saying, \"We need help dealing with the changing threat landscape.\" And so my expectation is you're going to continue to see a shift to the subscription businesses. Now the rate of growth, as James was commenting earlier, I think is going to moderate. But my expectation is, as you blend a combination of these rates, that they will definitely continue to be a much faster growing than our traditional core business. So continuing shift with a good growth rate. I'm going to let James comment on Clearwell and LiveOffice. The one thing I would tell you is LiveOffice is definitely one where we are seeing good pipeline building for that business as customers continue in their shift to the cloud-based services that I just talked about. I'll let James comment on the combination of Clearwell/LiveOffice, our guidance.", "James Beer", "Well, just in terms of the result for LiveOffice, remember that the accounting for this Hosted Service is fully ratable. So that recognized revenue will continue to build over the next several quarters, would be my expectation.", "Enrique T. Salem", "And also, we have the deferred write-downs.", "James Beer", "Yes.", "Operator", "And moving on to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "James, I noticed in the quarter, you had a higher restructuring charge -- I think $31 million -- than you've had in 4 or 5 quarters. And I'm wondering first of all, what was behind that? Was there some activity associated within end-of-year and kind of positioning for '13 or -- what drove that?", "James Beer", "Yes, Walt, as I was mentioning in an earlier answer, we very much look to reorient our spending towards the highest growth opportunities, and each fiscal year, we issue productivity targets to each of our business leaders. And so they have been taking moves that orient their spend in-line with where the best growth opportunities are and that's led through to the restructuring charge that you see that we recorded in Q4. So yes, this is very much an output of our stated strategy of moving our spend very materially to where the best opportunities are.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. And then just -- I don't know if there's an answer to this question. It may be an answer that could come at the Analyst Meeting in a few weeks, but, see, you have a variety of revenue streams here. Some are appearing in revenue, some are appearing on the balance sheet. You've got the kind of the -- the maintenance question that John was asking in maintenance versus subscription. And then you've got the pieces completely off balance sheet. And I'm wondering, what sort of metric could you show us that would give us a sense maybe more transparently of how you're managing the business or something that would help everyone get comfortable? Because it sounds like you're pretty confident with what the internal numbers show, but relative to what we see, we don't necessarily see things moving in the right direction.", "Enrique T. Salem", "That's actually something for us to contemplate a little bit further. Obviously, we -- you hit the 3 drivers, which are revenue, deferred and basically long-term deferred or off -- or what's off -- not on the balance sheet. We can think about it, Walter. I think it's a matter of trying to give you something that is consistent year in and year out. And one of the things that we struggle with is we have a bookings metric that gets refined each year based on a number of parameters, so I'll talk to our team about it and try to figure out if there's another metric for us to potentially share that'll give you that visibility that you're interested in. It's just something that I would want to be consistent. And what we like about things like revenue, deferred and potentially billings, is that those are going to be independent of aspects of managing the business. What we can absolutely do, though, is give you more specifics on things like what's the comp plan look like? We can talk a little bit about the changes, we can talk a little bit about the changes that we're continuing to make to incent the sales force to drive the results that we want. I think that's probably an area that we can spend a little bit of time during the Analyst Day that can give you a feel for the way we're driving the business.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "James, as you noted earlier, your license revenues fell 26% year-over-year and you spoke about the reasons behind that. But if we were to exclude Storage and Server Management, what would we have seen in license revenues for the quarter on a year-over-year basis?", "James Beer", "Well, I don't have that particular breakout for you, but it's safe to say that our Storage and Server Management business unit drives a preponderance of the license activity in any one particular quarter. Because if you think about the other business units we have, the Services business, that's generally, fully ratable. The consumer business is almost fully ratable. And then the Security and Compliance group, that has some amount of license content in products like DLP and encryption. But the biggest business there is the Endpoint Security and Suites business, and that has taken, if not fully ratably, almost fully ratably. So the single most important driver by a long stretch is the Storage and Server Management group when it comes to the license in-period revenue result.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Enrique, on the call last week, you expressed a lot of confidence that your integrated Backup Appliance and overall appliance business would see meaningful acceleration in fiscal '13. Can you put a finer point on that? Is that due more to technology, go-to-market, the pipeline you're seeing around the deals? Any color there would be helpful.", "Enrique T. Salem", "I think that the most important thing is that we've got the largest installed base of backup software. So NetBackup is the market share leader in the Enterprise and large enterprise segments. And what we see is an opportunity to deliver the integrated appliance that has the media server, the backup software and the deduplication software, all integrated as one device. Previously, what we were doing was we were selling the backup software and our customers were using other people's media server and other people's data deduplication technology. So really, this is an opportunity to sell appliances that, I believe, are differentiated because no one else can integrate these 3 pieces the way we have in one device and deliver that into our installed base.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "On the backup part -- I mean, the eDiscovery piece was down 3% and organic, that went down -- expect down even more x Clearwell. And I know there was a mix of rev rec issues in there. Can you give us an idea for what bookings would've been up? Because this has been a strong grower. So was this really all an accounting issue? Or if we look at this as on a bookings basis, what was the growth like there?", "James Beer", "Well, we don't have bookings and billings for you by business unit. So again, just going back to the, the sort of story of the quarter was around fewer of these larger deals, that particularly tends to be including backup and Storage Management. And so I think that gives you some sense -- while the volume of, for example, the million-plus deals that I referred to in my prepared remarks, were up several percent year-over-year, the dollars associated with those million-dollar-plus deals were down year-over-year, and that's very much driven by the typical big deal products, which tend to be NetBackup, the SAMG products, and to a lesser extent, Endpoint Security and so forth.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Right. So I just want to make sure it's clear, that it -- was that a bookings shortfall relative to your plan? I just want to figure out if this is a rev rec thing or if I'm right because if NetBackup pauses, NetBackup Exec pauses, that your real sales, however you want to measure them, were light, if that wasn't just accounting issue.", "James Beer", "No, I don't think we should describe this as purely an accounting issue.", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes. No, no, no, just -- we need to be clear on a point here, though, Michael. It's not accounting, but it's -- you may remember -- you remember 1 year ago, we talked about our deals above $1 million, and I also gave you a number, which is in deals above $10 million. So we -- 1 year ago, March, we did a lot of very large site license deals and those site licenses drive greater in-period revenues. So it's a bit of the volume of large-site license deals. That's not an accounting issue. That's an activity issue of large deals that tend to be more revenue rich. So it's a total volume of large-site licenses, is the point that we're making.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I'm not sure if that was my follow-up or not, but I'll take another shot. On the consumer you said that you did 2% growth and you said that was in-line with your goals. I can't remember if you said on bookings or revenue basis. But obviously, 2% is less than the 5-percenters trend that you had in -- less than my model, maybe less than others. So what should we think of as far as the trajectory going forward? Obviously, your prior long-term guidance was higher. I think you've said that on the pure list commentary that it would be in this range for a little while. How should we think of that trajectory longer term?", "Enrique T. Salem", "When we -- if you look at the consumer business, it came in around our expectation, maybe slightly below where we had anticipated for the quarter. And what we definitely are seeing, as you know, in our business, especially when we talk about the OEM deals, a lot of the units that we're shipping are going into the emerging markets that have a lower attach rate. Now we are seeing a bit of a pickup in total PC unit shipments, but that has continued to go into emerging markets. And so the outlook on the consumer business, my expectation is, that business will continue to grow year-over-year, but, I think, at a slightly reduced rate as we continue to see this shift in where PCs are going. Now the opportunity for us is, as Janice and her team have shipped products like Norton One, which allow us to create a capability that goes across devices -- as that product goes into the market, my expectation is that we'll start to see a improvement in the bookings for the consumer business. And so my expectation is that, that business will definitely grow year-over-year, but probably lower than we've seen in the previous periods.", "Operator", "And the next question'll come from Daniel Ives with FBR.", "Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Enrique, in light of a definitely slower growth, just walk me through rationale in regards to a potential dividend, and if your thoughts has changed in light of the outlook for next year?", "Enrique T. Salem", "We consider the various options of how we return value to shareholders. Obviously, our biggest goal is to drive the stock price and we work diligently at that. With regards to share repurchase and a dividend, James commented that we had repurchased about $893 million in the fiscal year. And we continue to always be open-minded to what we would do on dividend, but we do, at this point, continue to prefer the share repurchase. One thing that's interesting about $893 million is that number is a little bit higher than our onshore cash generation for the full fiscal year. And so ultimately, we are continuing to be a consistent, and quite frankly, aggressive buyer of our stock through our share repurchase. And that's probably the thing that we will continue through the fiscal year.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to come back to this transition toward more subscriptions. In the Enterprise subscription business, growth is certainly a bright spot. Could you comment on how much of that business may be replacement of existing products? And I know that most of this activity is in Security, not so much in Storage. But as you make this transition, how much is relative pricing playing a role and how much are you coming into new competitive dynamics when you go to a subscription model?", "Enrique T. Salem", "It's a bit of a blend, but when you look at businesses like MSS, Trust Services, User Authentication, those are net new opportunities that are not replacing an on-premise capability where we were the previous seller. Quite frankly, I look at these subscription business as a net new opportunity for Symantec. While there is some overlap in our traditional mail and messaging Security products, where customers are looking at the .cloud capability versus the on-premise, when I look at a lot of new growth opportunities, MSS, Trust Services, even our ev.cloud, where customers do have on-premise capability, ev.cloud is tending to go into new customers, not into the existing base of people moving from on-premise Enterprise vault to a cloud-based Enterprise vault. And the reason is when have a big on-premise archive, people aren't rushing to try and move that to the cloud for a number of reasons. And so I do see that a lot of these new subscription businesses are absolutely net incremental and not going into cannibalizing the existing base.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just to take a little higher level as a follow-up. I mean, you commented on Europe on your call last week. But looking forward at the different regions, what's your sense of tone of business in Europe and in Asia, where you've actually had some -- some pretty nice growth over the last couple of quarters?", "Enrique T. Salem", "We continue to look at the world in mature and emerging markets. Obviously, we've got emerging markets around the world. I think Brazil continues to perform well for us. Our emerging markets in Europe have continued to do well, obviously, emerging markets in Asia. I would tell you that the opportunity in Asia Pacific and Japan, I still believe to be probably in aggregate the fastest-growing. I do see the markets -- our emerging markets in parts of Europe will continue to grow. The German economy continues to be strong, and so I expect that to be the bright spot in Europe. Our performance in the U.K. was also very strong. That was a pleasant upside, but I do expect there to be a relatively more moderated growth in other parts of the more developed parts of the Americas.", "Helyn Corcos", "[Operator Instructions]", "Operator", "We'll take the next question from Philip Rueppel with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Philip C. Rueppel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just one last question around that sort of slowdown or the lack of growth in large deal count. Is there anything structural going on there? I mean, do you think that the pipeline for fiscal '13 looks like you should see growth there? Is there change in compensation that is causing less of the big deals or is it really just something that we're going to see from time to time ahead of major product launches, et cetera?", "Enrique T. Salem", "Yes, in a comp plan, there's no change that [indiscernible] to get the large deals. I think it's a matter of -- we definitely saw -- last March, we saw a number of quite a bit of pent-up demand and a number of very large-site licenses that came through. My expectation, though, is we are going to continue to see this mix shift, that I've been -- that James and I have been describing, to more subscription-oriented businesses. And I don't expect to see, as many real large site license deals going forward. Now, this is all built into what we've been sharing with you. And so as I look at the guidance we've given and the pipeline and the mix of products, given all the information we have, I'm very comfortable with the guidance and the mix of licenses subscription for the June quarter.", "All right. Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon and I look forward to speaking with you at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on May 24. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call to discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me today are Steve Bennett, Symantec's newly appointed Chairman, President and CEO; and James Beer, Symantec's Executive Vice President and CFO. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Steve. He will make a few opening remarks, then James will provide quarterly highlights and review our financial results as well as guidance assumptions as outlined in the press release. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website. And a copy of today's prepared remarks will be available shortly after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings-per-share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis only. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates. For the June 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.28 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.27 per euro, compared to the guided rate of $1.32. For the June '11 quarter, the actual weighted average was $1.44 per euro, and the end-of-period rate was $1.45.", "We've included a summary of the year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information, which are available on the website. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter, contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the statement. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website.", "And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Thanks, Helyn, and good morning, everyone. Thanks, really, for joining us at this rescheduled time. We apologize for the last-minute change, but because of the announcement, we felt it was the right thing to do to make this change on short notice. So I'm really glad to be here on our earnings call and my first day on my new job.", "The decision to replace Enrique was a tough one. It was not based on any particular event or issue but one that the board made after reflection on the ongoing company performance. While progress has been made over the last 3 years in many areas, it was the board's decision that making a change now was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. Enrique has been a significant contributor during his 19 years at Symantec. Throughout his time, and especially during his last 3 years as CEO, Enrique showed an incredible dedication to customers and strong enthusiasm to pursue new emerging opportunities. I want to recognize and thank him for his considerable commitment and wish him the best in the future.", "My perspective is while the company has very strong assets, we are underperforming against the opportunities.  And I'm very excited about working with our leaders to speed up the pace at which we create value for all of our stakeholders. My first order of business will be to speak with our customers, partners and shareholders, and over the next 90 to 120 days I'm going on a tour to listen, learn and work with the leadership team to figure out the right strategy to leverage all of Symantec resources to accelerate our rate of value creation. Once this tour is completed, I'll share our go-forward strategy to win in the marketplace and how we're going to drive accelerated revenue and profit growth. This is a process I've used before many times in the past. It's been successful, and I look forward to applying this similar playbook at Symantec.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review the quarterly highlights and financial details.", "James A. Beer", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Let me start by welcoming you, Steve, to the management team, and I look forward to working closely with you to drive value creation at Symantec. Now, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our consumer results were driven by ongoing cross-selling and up-selling. The consumer security products continue to demonstrate best-in-class quality, winning over 250 awards in the past 2 years. Though early in their product life cycle, our newest premium suites, Norton One and Norton 360 Everywhere, have received very positive feedback, with Norton One earning the Editor's Choice Award from PC Magazine. We also refreshed and extended our portfolio to target the growing number of Mac users.", "Norton Online Backup and NortonLive solutions maintained their strong performance and continued to be meaningful contributors to the growth of our business. Our Norton Mobile Security solution maintained its leadership position in the mobile security market as we surpassed Lookout as the top-grossing security app in the Google Play marketplace. While still a nascent market, our products continue to receive top reviews, with Norton Mobile Security earning 4.4 stars in Google Play. We also signed new Norton Mobile Security partnerships with several leading wireless retailers and carriers in all 3 regions.", "On the enterprise side, our backup, archiving and eDiscovery solutions continue to drive momentum. Our enterprise backup business continues to be driven by customers' desire to minimize complexity and backup challenges without complicating recovery. With 3 Best of VMworld awards, Symantec is the industry leader in VMware and Hyper-V backup. Only Symantec offers a single product capable of providing true individual file recovery, deduplication and policy management across the VMware, Hyper-V and traditional physical servers.", "Let me spend a moment on an area where we didn't execute to our high standards on a new product launch. While we delivered a much improved user interface For Backup Exec, we excluded specific functionality that customers still required. As such, we have now reinstated this functionality to further simplify the backup process. We expect it will take 2 to 3 quarters to get Backup Exec back on track.", "Our backup appliance business is gaining significant traction and has been well received by customers and the industry alike. Our 5220 appliance won the Backup and Recovery Award at Microsoft's Best of TechEd 2012 event. In the June quarter, we delivered our first appliance for the midmarket, and we continued to grow our Appliance business by expanding our portfolio into additional geographies.", "The quality of our endpoint protection product, SEP 12, continues to garner industry acclaim. Third-party research has confirmed that SEP 12 uses less computing power to provide greater protection than competitive offerings. In addition, at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit, the quality of SEP was identified as a primary threat to our competitors.", "Trust Services, our SSL certificate business, had another strong quarter. We continue to differentiate our premium and value SSL brands, driving growth in both market segments. We've also simplified and streamlined our online enrollment process, which will be rolled out to other geographies throughout the year.", "Our Data Loss Prevention solutions saw strong growth across all of our geographies, including an increased appetite for DLP in Europe. We are winning competitive bids by demonstrating our market-leading capability to protect sensitive information from the desktop to the server. We rolled out DLP for tablets in fiscal 2012 to accommodate the breadth of devices in use and plan to extend support to the iPhone later this year.", "eDiscovery and cloud-based archiving exceeded our expectations this quarter, as we leveraged the scope and scale of the Symantec sales force. Both products were named leaders in their respective Gartner Magic Quadrants as customers reported that our solutions were easy to buy, implement and use.", "User authentication continued its strong growth in the first quarter. We continue to gain market share as customers choose our Software-as-a-Service-based authentication solution for its ease of use and best-in-class security. As governments and businesses deliver more online services requiring security, we expect to see continued growth for these services.", "Leveraging our user authentication technology, our security for the cloud solution, O3, signed its first large enterprise customer and continues to garner significant attention. Enterprises are rapidly shifting their software needs to the cloud, and the security and visibility O3 offers addresses a critical customer need.", "We made significant progress towards developing the first complete enterprise mobility solution, including device and application management, data protection and full compliance capabilities. While we work towards integrating these best-of-breed capabilities, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers.", "Moving now to the financial details.  We posted better-than-expected first quarter results to each of our key financial metrics for which we guide: revenue, deferred revenue and EPS.", "GAAP revenue totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of 4% versus the June 2011 period. Our Clearwell and LiveOffice acquisitions together accounted for $24 million of total revenue. Our organic constant currency revenue growth rate for the June quarter was 1% year-over-year. Despite the U.S. dollar strengthening by approximately 11% against the euro year-over-year, our results were better than expected. Total foreign currency movements negatively impacted revenue growth by 3 percentage points, driving a reported revenue growth rate of 1%.", "Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, our license revenue declined 6%, while content and maintenance revenue grew 2%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and Software-as-a-Service offerings, grew 10% and accounted for 44% of total revenue compared to 42% of revenue in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year-ago period.", "The Consumer business generated revenue of $521 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by upselling customers to our premium suites and growing our emerging businesses, such as Online Backup, NortonLive Services and our mobile applications.", "The Storage and Server Management segment generated revenue of $584 million, an increase of 1% as compared to the June 2011 quarter, driven by continued growth in our backup and archiving business. Revenue from the Information Management business, which includes our backup archiving and eDiscovery offerings, increased 6% year-over-year, driven by our appliances, cloud-based archiving and eDiscovery solutions. Revenue from the storage and availability management business declined 8% year-over-year. This business continues to be highly profitable and generates strong cash flow for the company.", "The Security and Compliance segment generated revenue of $501 million, up 10% year-over-year, as our endpoint protection business continues to gain market share with enterprise customers. Our authentication services and data loss prevention solutions continued to post double-digit growth.", "This is the first quarter of year-over-year growth for our Services business since we transitioned our consulting services to specialized partners. Our Services business generated revenue of $62 million, up 1% year-over-year.", "Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 140 basis points to 84.3%, as higher costs are associated with these businesses, a trend we expect to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1%, down 60 basis points compared to the June 2011 quarter. Operating margins were better than we expected in the June quarter due to lower-than-expected OEM fees which accounted for approximately $0.01 of benefit to EPS. In addition, ongoing cost controls decreased expenses as we continued to tightly manage our expense structure.", "Improved operating leverage from better-than-expected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. Net income of $309 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Continued growth in subscriptions and maintenance contributed to deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.75 billion.", "We exited the June quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which was an increase of 79% year-over-year, driven primarily by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14 and the sale of our 49% stake in the Huawei-Symantec joint venture. As we exited the June quarter, approximately 47% of our cash balance resided in the U.S., which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from our June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 30% of our cash balance resides in the U.S.", "We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $301 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 19 million shares at an average price of $15.59. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted operating cash flow by $12 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $340 million.", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the September 2012 quarter. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, we expect GAAP revenue for the September 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.635 billion to $1.665 billion dollars. We expect year-over-year revenue to be down 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 76% or $1.25 billion of our September quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. LiveOffice is expected to contribute between $7 million and $8 million to our September quarter revenue.", "As a result of raising $1 billion in senior notes during June, our interest expense for the next 4 quarters will be higher by $8 million per quarter. This will decrease EPS by $0.008 per quarter for a total of approximately $0.03 of dilution through June of 2013. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.15 and $0.19 as compared to $0.24 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.39, down 10% to flat on an as-reported basis. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.49 billion and $3.55 billion. We are expecting deferred revenue to be up 1% to 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% to 4% in constant currency.", "I'd like to remind everyone that the September quarter typically produces the lowest quarterly operating cash flow of each year. Lastly, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.23 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.41 and the end-of-period rate of $1.34 per euro in the September 2011 quarter. Our $1.23 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 13% from our weighted average rate in the year-ago period and a decrease of 4% sequentially. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 710 million shares.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on our upcoming conference events. We will be presenting at the Citi Technology Conference on September 5 in New York City, and we'll be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on October 24. For a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit our Investors section of the Investor Relations website. Operator, we're ready to take our first question.", "Operator", "And our first question will come from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Steve, I appreciate the need to do some initial fact-finding over the next several months and go out and do the tour that you spoke of, but are there any observations as Chairman that you can share and any obvious changes that could be made to drive shareholder value?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Brad, I think the answer is -- I debated whether to put this in the script or not. In the employee communication, what we're saying is a two-prong approach. While we spend 90 to 120 days working through to make sure that we have the right strategy to lead the security market in the future, to win in the mobile-connected virtual world like we won in the desktop PC world, we're also going to be making  -- we're going to learn a lot of things in that process that we'll make action-oriented decisions as soon as we run into. I don't know exactly what those are. I don't come in to the job with some clarity on that, but rest assured that I want to make a difference quickly in Symantec and help energize the place and make the kind of decisions that are going to help us accelerate value creation. So it's a two-prong approach. While we're working on the strategy, we will also be making shorter-term decisions.  But I can't give you any clarity around what those will be today.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And just a follow-up for James. James, if I look at -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks that cross-selling was strong in the quarter, but if I look at the percentage of deals with both storage and security, it seems to be at an all-time low. Is there something about the coordination of the sales effort that might've changed, and do you still believe that Symantec has the right offering to be successful in the market in terms of going to market with both halves of the offering?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, Brad, I think our sales force absolutely continues to make more progress in terms of the cross-selling effort. I think what we're seeing in the marketplace right now is more, smaller transactions, customers really looking to purchase what they need for their immediate term rather than some of the broader transactions that we've seen in prior quarters. So I think that's just a reflection of the macro environment.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question is for Steve. Steve, I appreciate that it's probably too early to say exactly what you're going to do, but one of the things whenever we see a change at the helm like this, there's always a high probability or high risk for disruptions in the business. And I guess, just a question, what you're going to do to try to offset that, at least over the next couple of quarters?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, I think the advantage I have coming in from the Chairman role is I've been working and getting to know the management team over the last couple of years. And there's a lot of really positive things going on here. I'm quite excited about some of the new product launches that we've just launched. So I think it's too early to speculate, because I think it's -- there's going to be a lot of subtle things that have to change and evolve. This is an evolution, not a revolution. And so maybe I'll learn some things that as we go forward that we'll have to change, but I don't sense a big amount of disruption. I think we have a very strong leadership team. I compare this to what I saw when I came to Intuit in 2000, and I actually think Symantec has a lot of capabilities in place that we had to build at Intuit. So I don't see a lot of disruption, but we'll see and deal with that.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And if I might change, I guess just a question on guidance. It looks pretty modest here, and probably appropriately.  But does that have something to do with some of the change here? And I guess, what's behind us? Is it more about it's pretty much flattish revenue, and, I guess, kind of constant currency up 1% to 3%.  But is there increased concerns about the economy? Are there -- it looks like Europe actually was up on a constant-currency basis or EMEA, which is interesting. I guess can you comment about that, about the macro environment and how that may be affecting guidance?", "James A. Beer", "Obviously, as we go through our usual guidance process, we think about the macro environment, the customer environment, so forth and we feel as though we've appropriately taken that into account in both the absolute guidance and the way in which we guide. You, I'm sure, have noticed we've broadened out our ranges, for example. We've also acknowledged that foreign exchange is a material headwind here, both year-over-year and sequentially as well by the looks of things. So I think those are important factors to really focus on as you think through the guide that we've offered this morning.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "James, just a follow-up on Brad's question on the multiproduct transactions. It does look like independent of size, both of those metrics, the 300 and under and the $1 million and over, took a pretty dramatic downtick. And, I mean, was that a factor of Backup Exec in the quarter? Just trying to maybe put a finer point on what drove that, because it was fairly steady, and those metrics did both take a tick-down.", "James A. Beer", "I think it's also fair to say that year-over-year, the June quarter was a tough compare for us on these large deal statistics. We had some quite robust statistics this time a year ago. And so Backup Exec, as we've acknowledged in our commentary that we have challenges there. And so yes, that's a component of it. But again, I see a clear shift towards people buying more so for their immediate needs rather than making longer-term commitments, necessarily, at this point in time. And I don't think that's surprising, given where we are in the overall environment.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just a question on Europe. I guess maybe also for you, James. It looks like your performance was pretty good, especially in light of what's going on over there, and was just wondering if you could put a little bit finer point on either country commentary or some regional commentary around what you saw in the different geographies and if it varied between consumer and enterprise and so forth.", "James A. Beer", "Yes, we were very pleased with the continued performance of the U.K. and also in our emerging EMEA regions. So Middle East, parts of Africa, parts of Eastern Europe. Not surprisingly, Southern Europe was much tougher for us, and I was pleased by what we saw, both on the consumer and enterprise side of the house.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Steve, welcome back into the game. I guess my first question is for you. Obviously, you've answered the operational questions, but can you just refresh us on your philosophy around capital distribution and capital structure?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think that it's emerged over time. I think that at the end of the day, and we've had this discussion at the board meeting in my previous role, to be clear on our capital allocation philosophy is to first define how much money we need to run the company, kind of a minimum cash threshold. And then above that, I think a lot of companies now that I've been involved in, are evaluating the best way to return excess cash to shareholders. And so that's a discussion that we're having. We don't have any decisions or any change in direction at this point, but that's something. And then I think obviously, we want to look hard at adjusted rate of return on acquisitions that is accretive to our portfolio. I give Enrique and James and team credit for really putting a lot more rigor in the acquisition process at Symantec over the last couple of years, both on the pricing, the negotiations and the integration, and I think the results have been better. So I think that we're going to continue to think about how we return excess cash to shareholders. I think the company will continue to produce excess cash and that we will produce more cash than we will spend on acquisitions. So the real question is what's the most thoughtful way to return that to shareholders?  And I think that will be an ongoing discussion for the board, and if we change some thoughts on how to deal with that, I think we'll let you know. But it is a topic that's on the agenda for discussions.", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then maybe a question for you, James. If you look at your license revenue growth in the last several quarters, it had been kind of stable, and obviously, it's starting to move around a little bit. Is the -- license revenue growth down 6% in constant currency.  Is that something that starts to improve as you get better mix around some of the emerging products?  Or is there something else that you have to do at this point to get that business or that part of business, I should say, reaccelerated?", "James A. Beer", "Adam, in terms of the license revenue growth percentage year-over-year, obviously, we saw a bounce-back from what we were recording in the last quarter. So that was important to see, and clearly, we'll continue work on building that statistic. But once again, I really emphasized in my remarks the growth of subscription, because more of our new offerings into the market are on a subscription basis. And so, we're really pleased by the strong growth that we continue to see on our subscription business basically, overall, but we particularly also break out the enterprise subscription, which is growing at quite a nice 20%-plus pace.", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So should we be thinking about that business, then, as continuing to decline going forward? Or is there a level at which there's kind of a run rate where it stabilizes, the license side?", "James A. Beer", "Clearly, when you think about the license drivers of the business, it's largely on the enterprise side, and products like Backup Exec, as we work to get that back on track, that will be a relatively license-revenue-rich product, as is today NetBackup and so forth. And you know how we're focused on building our appliance activities around both of our backup product areas. So I think there are opportunities to continue to build on the year-over-year license revenue statistics. But I would just really emphasize the continued growth of the subscription business on the enterprise side. And of course, largely, the Consumer business is a subscription service as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Steve, just a question for you.  As you start to evaluate the business here, are all sort of strategic options on the table and in your mind, i.e., sale, divestiture, or do you actually believe that the current structure of Symantec is the appropriate one right now?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Phil, I think it's a good question, and I guess my view on this is one of the advantages of coming in from the outside is you start with a clean sheet of paper. And that's why I'm so excited about the listening tour where I'll be out talking to investors, customers, partners, employees. But I don't feel constrained at all by anything. And I think that will be healthy for our company, to take a clean sheet of paper, zero base to look, and I have lots of questions to ask. And I'm going to collect a lot of data. But I'm completely wide open, I start with a clean sheet of paper. But the most important thing is strategy, and structure follows strategy. So this is an important thing for me to really get right, working with the team. I'm not going to figure it out by myself, but we have a team of really smart people here, and I think this fresh look will really help us. But I will tell you that I don't feel at all constrained by the board. I took this job because I believe that our assets are better than our performance, and I need to learn what's getting in the way. And I think there's strategic clarity that we should be able to bring that will improve our focus and execution and resource allocation, and as I said earlier, so that we get back to the leadership position in the future, mobile-connected world that we had in the desktop PC world. That's my goal, is to bring a strategy to the table in the next 90 to 120 days that positions us for that position in the future.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just one quick follow-up. I have a lot of questions today on sort of the cross-sell percentage of this company. Do you actually believe a single sales force for both storage and security is appropriate? Or is that a to be determined?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "My view on this is I think it's a good use case to run through the previous thing. I think it will be a great thing for me to learn, and I think we want to be sensitive, obviously, to any transition. I don't think you'll see any big decisions like that until we have a strategy. But structure and resource allocation follow strategy. So let's figure out where we're winning and why, where we're losing and why and then make thoughtful, informed decisions based on which hills we're going to charge and then get everybody mobilized to charge those hills, and we're going to pick hills that we believe we can win based on the competitive environment, the resources and assets we have, and then we'll make whatever decisions are required, whether organizational, resource allocation, sales force alignment, to get all of our employees in the boat rowing in the same direction. And I think that clarity of purpose will produce better results than what we've produced over the last few years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A lot of my questions have been answered, but can we go quickly, James, maybe into the cost base?  You've done consistently better on the sales to market side than we have kind of anticipated. Can you just talk a little bit of, as you go through the transition, as you kind of see how the top line is growing, how you think about cost in that process?", "James A. Beer", "Well, Bill Robbins and his team have been focusing for some years now on gradually improving their productivity and so forth, and I'm pleased by the progress that we've all made together. We certainly feel as though there are opportunities for continued improvement over time. Some of what Bill has been focusing on of late is redesigning the way we have our specialist teams in the marketplace in order to gather together what were previously separate specialist groups into larger groups that focus on related technologies. And so it's things like that, that are allowing us to be more effective in terms of serving our customers and getting a greater productivity as a result. And of course, the best leverage here in terms of productivity is by growing the top line.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I think a question that's come up a little bit that some people may have is, Steve, whether this is sort of a transitory role for you or this is sort of a long-term position that you're going to commit to.  And in this process, I know you pointed out that this was not sort of based on any singular event but whether sort of full sort of outside candidate was also looked at.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "The answer to that is no, because the board believed that because of my experience and track record and knowledge of the company that I was the right CEO. Some background on that is they did look at and did a dry search, actually, before the decision was made to promote Enrique 3 years ago, and it just turns out coincidentally, I was on the short list for that decision 3 years ago, so although that search was never commenced and the decision was made to hire Enrique. So no, I'm the CEO, and I have told my wife, Ma [ph], \"This might be a 5-year deal, it might be a 3-year deal, but the commitment I made to the board when I took the job is that I will do this job until I'm comfortable we're in a position and have either an internal candidate, preferably, that -- like we did at Intuit, turning over the reins to Brad Smith. I will not turn over the leadership of this company until I've been able to get it on a course I'm comfortable with, and my goal would be to stay on as Chairman at that point.  So I have a long-term involvement. And in the mix of what the roles are and how that shapes out will be determined by our ability to make sure we've got the leadership in place to help the company achieve the strategy we're going to set out.\"", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe a follow-up question for James. You made some comments about sort of the seasonality to the cash flow here in the second quarter, but would you expect still that for the year that the cash flow could be sort of flattish with prior year?", "James A. Beer", "Well, we don't guide to the full year for cash flow, but I'll just remind everyone, obviously, over the last couple of years, we've grown cash flow consistently, and obviously, that's a key goal for the company overall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "James, maybe just a couple of questions. You talked about as it relates to the segments of the business, Backup Exec being kind of 2- to 3-quarter decision process that we got to work through here. It looks like the Consumer business, we all know the PC market doesn't look very good, at least for the next quarter or 2. Can you just talk to us directionally on how you see, given that you have the deferred revenue visibility that maybe we don't have, how do you expect the Consumer business to trend over the next -- or over the year, I should say? And then maybe just as a backup question to the prior analyst, when you think about cash flow, you're coming in at $340 million and seasonally low, it would appear difficult that it would actually grow year-on-year just given where DSOs are at 34 days for the quarter. Any other finer points would be helpful.", "James A. Beer", "First of all, in terms of the Consumer business, we're very pleased by the ongoing growth there. Janice and her team have put together a remarkable string of quarters of continued and consistent growth. And obviously, we are very focused on continuing that. Underlying that is the fundamental strength of our core products that get terrific reviews consistently, while at the same time, we're very much focused on bringing new services to market, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, very much oriented around the mobile world. And I think underpinning all of that is the investment that we've put in recent years into the e-commerce engine, which offers us such greater granularity into pricing, the behavior of different segments of our customer base on a geographic basis. So we're able to continue learning, continue developing in order to allow us this consistent ability to upsell and cross-sell, which drives the growth as we, in essence, seed and develop our place in the newer mobile space. So that's the strategy. We're absolutely focused in continuing on that, and as we execute, I think there's more opportunity for the Consumer business to grow. So we're pleased by how that is consistently developing. Now in terms of cash flow, obviously, I did note earlier how we had an FX headwind. And certainly, looking at how the euro is going, it's perfectly plausible that there would be those continuing headwinds for the next several months.  We'll see. But that said, we're very focused on continuing to grow the top line. We've got a strong set of products and services that are very relevant to the marketplaces in which we operate. Yes, we have a problem in the Backup Exec area. We're really focused on sorting that out. And with that focus, with that level of effort, we'll keep building the cash flow. And it is volatile, more volatile than an accounting metric, obviously, in any 1 quarter, but I think we have plenty of opportunity ahead.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Steve, a question for you, then a follow-up for James. Stephen, obviously the business has been pretty flat. If you had to take a look and say what you thought were the areas that would be most likely to drive reaccelerated growth near term and those that would be most likely to drive it long term, what would those be?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think that's too early for me to answer that question, because I'm going to start from a customer-back -- Intuit has been successful by starting with the important customer problem and then working back. So I'm going to actually -- in my listening and learning tour, I'm going to be out talking to futurists and people that are very \"where is the world going in the future?\" And I'm going to start from the market back and as we build the strategy. So I actually prefer not to articulate, because I want to start with customer and projected future needs and work back and then organize around the company around what are the mountains that we are going to charge, what are the hills we're going to take?  And so I actually think it would be inside out to think about products and services today. And I actually think that's part of our opportunity, is to rethink strategically the whole way the company approaches the market, come market back and be unconstrained by existing structures and existing way we think about things. And so I'm actually quite excited to go on this listening tour and get opinions from all over the world on the most important customer problems that we can solve better than anybody else and make money. And if we do that right and focus on those critical areas, I think we'll accelerate the rate of value creation for our investors and our other stakeholders. So I'm going to defer that, but that will be a robust discussion in the next 30 -- 90 to 120 days or whenever I get to the point to share that. And you guys, I'm sure, will be, other than our employees, some of the first ones to hear where we come down.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And James, we had down bookings this quarter and last quarter, and it looks like the guidance is for slightly down next. I think the hope had been in the second half, you would start to see bookings positive in terms of growth. Do you think we're still on track to that?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I wouldn't try to go beyond the guidance that we've already offered this morning, but as you look at the implied billings statistics, if you do the foreign exchange adjustments and just really focus on the organic statistics, the June quarter implied billings were up 4% year-over-year. So that was an important rebound from where we had been in the previous 2 quarters, where we were down year-over-year in both of those.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, you had mentioned earlier that Symantec has a lot of capabilities in place that did not exist at Intuit when you joined 12 years prior. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that and perhaps provide some examples of what you think currently works very well at Symantec, whether from an R&D, distribution or operational standpoint?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think, Gregg, it's an excellent question, and let me just give you a couple of specific answers, because as you know, what you see in the depth of level of knowledge you see as a board member or a Chairman is a lot different than you see as a CEO. So there's some things I know, but there's a lot of things I don't know. The board actually went through and did a tour on Monday of the -- I think it was Monday now -- of the new e-commerce platform that Janice and her team built that James referred to earlier, and I saw just an incredible e-commerce platform, that I say this is an unbelievable asset in our A-B testing capability, and the team that is running that is very exciting. Frankly, my conclusion on that is, \"Boy, there's a lot of companies out there that should be using this, because it's better than anything I'd seen.  And so what do you do with that now as a company? I mean, we've built it internally. It's awesome.\"  So that's the kind of thing, Gregg, that I've got to learn more about and say, \"Hey, this is an asset. Are we really leveraging this in the way that we could, or we are just using it internal?\"  Now there may be something there.  There may not be anything there. So it's another -- I'd give Enrique credit for. I mean, we have a performance management system for the organization here that's pretty robust.  That's pretty important as we move forward. So there's organizational things, there's assets in the customer and marketing area. I think there's a lot of questions. To be honest, I bet I have the same questions that many of you would have, and those are all things I'm going to take on in this listening and learning tour, and I'll be much better prepared to talk about that as we get together here again toward the end of the year, 120 days from now. But I'm actually looking forward to that discussion, because I think that I'll be much better informed now than I am then -- or then than I am now.", "James A. Beer", "And just building on one of those points, Steve, one of the areas where the team is already under way around thinking -- the next step, if you will, is around the e-commerce engine, where we see potential to bring it also over onto the enterprise side of the business, particularly focusing around small-, medium-size businesses where you put a lot of the same types of needs and capabilities. So there are -- I think there's some very interesting opportunities in the areas like that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just was going to go back to the \"blank sheet of paper\" kind of line of questioning, and I believe the mission, I don't know if it's written into the formal mission statement, has been to protect information. Do you go to the field in just fact finding kind of under that existing mission statement or is that mission statement subject to revision in the future after you go through this process?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think it's a very thoughtful question. When I -- all I can do is give you kind of my experience at Intuit, which is the most relevant, which the mission statement is revolutionize people's lives by solving important problems. And it was an unconstraining mission statement, because there's a lot of problems, but the logic there was uncover important customer problems that we can solve better than anybody else in the world and make money. And that's the same logic I'm going to apply at Symantec. I learned that from Scott Cook and Bill Campbell at Intuit. I think it was very powerful, simple, strategic logic. Symantec has very strong assets in many areas. The customers' needs are changing dramatically and radically. As I said, our goal is to lead in the future mobile interconnected world like we did on the desktop PC world. So I believe, and I'm very sensitive, we did not change the mission at Intuit, but it was broad enough to allow us to change the strategy. And so I don't know, to be honest.  I don't believe we will be constrained by the mission of Symantec. I'd like to be consistent there if it does not constrain us, but that's one of the questions I'm going to have to figure out. I will not be constrained in how I think about finding important customer problems that we can solve better than anybody else in the world and make money. And that will be the foundation for the strategy this company is going to move forward on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I had a question really for James. As -- you had mentioned that enterprise subscriptions saw 22% growth, and this really goes back to the question about the mix between products and subscriptions and the transitions toward more cloud-based solutions. Could you comment on how this is -- how you're seeing this impact the mix in the business? And for Steve, how this broader transition may inform the questions that you ask and how you may be looking to derive value out of some of the assets like the e-commerce platform?", "James A. Beer", "First of all, the enterprise subscriptions business actually grew 24% year-over-year, so a good strong number, and where we're in the financial model seeing this manifest itself is a continued increase in the volume of our in-period revenue that is rolling straight off the balance sheet. So in this September quarter, we're going to have 76% of our revenue coming off the balance sheet. So that's been a steady increase over the last couple of years, and I would expect that to continue as we bring more service offerings into the marketplace.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So Ed, strategically, again, I love the question, and I really appreciate the strategic nature a lot of these questions you folks are asking today, because I really do enjoy that kind of dialogue with our investors or our analysts. Look, the best thing I can do, again, is bring a philosophy that was developed at GE and applied at Intuit, which is I don't start with whether it's subscription or whether it's desktop or license. I start with how do we solve an important customer problem?  How do we deliver that product or service? I actually call it an offering so we don't have a debate of whether it's a product or a service.  And how do we be ubiquitous to how customers want to buy? Because I'm indifferent if they bought TurboTax on the web or as a Software-as-a-Service or on a desktop. What I want to do is win the product offering game, solve that problem than anybody else, however they want to buy it. Is it a license? Is it an appliance? Is it a Software-as-a-Service subscription? I want to be better than anybody else at meeting that customer need, and I don't want to start with growing -- now I think the outcome of that, based on the secular trends, is we're going to see more Software-as-a-Service and all that.  But I want to be the best appliance solution and the best license solution and the best subscription-offering Software-as-a-Service solution and let customers pick what's right for them. And small businesses, consumers, different enterprises might pick different solutions. If you had to say, \"How are you going to prioritize?\" or, \"What's your thinking going into it?\"  Look, I think we want to skate to where the puck's going, not to where it's been. And so we're going to be much more focused on the emerging and the future needs, and I think we're going to have to accelerate our pace and rate of change away from winning in the past to winning in the future.  And that may take some courage and some leadership from our team. But that's what we're going to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.", "Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "I'd like to ask if there's a possibility that you'll be back sooner than 90 or 120 days? It seems to me many of us on this call would say it won't take you that long to find out what the value perception is among your customers for signature-based anti-malware. So is there a chance you'd be back sooner just to let us know, perhaps, a binary statement about whether the plan will be incremental or bold with respect to your portfolio? And the second question's specifically on the Consumer business. Do you have a strong hypothesis or opinion about the changing risk profile of your Consumer business right now with respect to Windows 8 or Microsoft's willingness now to, perhaps, move strategically against its hardware partners and maybe close that platform up a good deal and resemble Apple much more?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Look, I think we have to figure out a way to leverage our assets, do something that other folks can't do. And I think our products have big advantages over a single-platform system today. And I think what we will try and -- I mean, I think the answer -- first, let me answer your question. I think the answer is no. We will make some decisions that you might see or hear about that to me are more strategy-independent. But I think those will be more on the shorter-term value creation. I think the big, big leverage point and the big decisions will be sorting through the reality of how the market's evolving, to your point, and figuring out where to place our chips. So I would defer, I don't think there's going to be any big strategic decisions. And look, I want to travel around the world. I'm going to go to India, I've got to visit all of our customers. So there's a lot for me to learn not just about the strategy, but part of this is learning  the organization's capability to execute the new strategy and make them part of the process. So I think there's something more than just figuring out the strategy. I think it's all part of getting the organization mobilized and starting that [ph] so we can execute the new strategy, however that comes down. So I actually think that's an important part of this process. If it was just the strategy process for presentation, I could do it faster than 90 days. But the big part of this is making sure I'm working the organizational and change-management part of this, which I've got a long track record of doing multiple times, to produce excellent results. And so that's what takes more time than just the strategy. Look, to me it's an integrated process, and that's why it will take the kind of timeframes I talked about.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, operator. I think that's it.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Let me just close to everybody. Thank you. I'm glad to be back in the game. Actually, the last day or so, I realized I might have missed it more than I thought, and I'm quite excited and energized to be back. I'd like to thank all the Symantec employees for delivering a solid quarter, and I look forward to working with all of them to make Symantec continue on the path to accelerate value creation for all our stakeholders. So thanks, and I look forward to our next discussion next quarter or at the appropriate time. Thanks for joining us, again, on short notice.

He will make a few opening remarks, then James will provide quarterly highlights and review our financial results, as well as discuss our guidance and assumptions. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information are posted on our website as well. Today's prepared remarks will be posted on the IR site after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for all constant currency year-over-year growth rates.", "For the September 2012 quarter, the actual weighted average exchange rate was $1.25 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.29 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.23 per euro. These compared to the September 2011 quarter, where the actual weighted average rate was $1.41 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.34 per euro. We've included a summary of actual and currency-adjusted growth rates in our press release tables and in our supplemental information which are available on the IR website.", "Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, deferred revenue, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on the IR website.", "And now I'll turn it over to our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When a company announces an unplanned CEO change, you never know what to expect because of all the uncertainty that's created. Thanks to the focus and dedication of all Symantec employees, I'm pleased to report that the team stepped up during this transition. While working on our plan to change and improve the company for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders, we executed well in the second quarter, delivering better-than-expected financial results. While the team focused on delivering in the current quarter, we are also working on creating value over a longer term time horizon.", "Starting with a clean sheet of paper, the team is hard at work developing a strategy and operational plan that will help us deliver even more value for our customers and partners. So we win in the market and improve our financial performance. Our goal is to deliver a strategy and plan that will consistently deliver greater than 5% organic growth and 30% operating margins within the next 2 to 3 years. At this point, we believe we will reach sustained greater than 30% operating margins faster than 5% sustained organic growth. This plan will be one that both the leadership team and the board believe we can deliver against in the short and long term.", "In the meantime, we are also -- we also continue to evaluate all of our strategic alternatives to create shareholder value and believe we are on track to share our new strategic direction and operational plan in late January of 2013. We are moving to quickly change so we can continue to improve our performance on a global basis. With more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., we can no longer operate like a U.S.-based company with global distribution.", "As you can see from our recent history, our growth rates are higher outside the U.S. Our head of worldwide sales will be leaving the company. To better position us to win globally, we've decided to elevate the geo leadership roles and have them report directly to me. This move expands the scope of our regional leaders, making them ambassadors and general managers of their geographies. While their primary focus will be sales in their geographies, they will also play an expanded Symantec leadership role. We believe this will allow us to accelerate our pace of change and make better and faster decisions so we perform at a higher level on both a global and local basis.", "I'd like to spend a moment on our guidance for the December quarter. We're pleased that revenue and deferred revenue continue to grow year-over-year and sequentially, especially in this uncertain global economic environment. However, operating margin is lower in the December quarter than either the September or year ago December quarters. This may seem counter to what I told you in September, that we would self-fund investments without reducing operating margin. And that's still my commitment.", "After our January announcement, we will self-fund this and future investments without reducing operating margin. But we need to make these investments now and not wait until after the January announcement to set the foundation for longer term organic growth. The investments will be allocated to areas like technical support, so we better serve our customers and partners. This is the right thing to do to create long term shareholder value, no matter where we come out on our strategy and operational plan announcement in late January.", "Over the past 90 days, I met with front-line employees, customers and partners, industry experts and shareholders all around the world. Our customer is saying what you probably already know. They want us and need us to become better and to win, but think we're getting in our own way. We must become more customer and partner solutions focused rather than product-specific. We must move faster to solve their future versus their past problems. And we must become easier to do business with and less fragmented as a company to become a better and stronger partner.", "I've been positively surprised by the amount of unmet and underserved needs customers have in this challenging and fast-moving security and information management market. And while I still have a lot to learn, I can say with confidence that there are plenty of big opportunities for Symantec. To take advantage of these opportunities, we need to think and act differently, both strategically and operationally in ways that leverage all of our significant assets to better solve our customers' most important problems. And that's what the January announcement will be all about.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our quarterly results.", "James A. Beer", "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon. We posted better-than-expected second quarter results with record September revenue and deferred revenue, as well as strong operating margins and EPS. These results drove our organic constant currency revenue growth to 3% for the September quarter year-over-year. GAAP revenue grew 5% to $1.7 billion, driven by strengthen in our Security and Information Management businesses. Our hosted archiving acquisition of LiveOffice contributed $10 million in revenue, which was better than expected. Our subscription business continues to grow. In constant currency, content, maintenance and subscription revenue grew 7%, while license revenue declined 9%. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, MSS and SaaS offerings grew 10% and accounted for 45% of total revenue as compared to 42% of revenue in the year ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude our consumer offerings, grew 24% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% of revenue in the year ago period.", "We recorded a strong quarter in our Consumer business despite the challenges we've seen across the PC industry. The Consumer business grew 3% year-over-year to $528 million and generated its 16th consecutive quarter of growth. These results were driven by up-selling customers to our premium suites at improved pricing and growing our emerging backup, NortonLive Services and mobile businesses.", "Our Consumer business is ready for the release of Windows 8. In third-party testing, Windows 8 ran 50% faster and 20% safer when paired with our new Norton solutions versus machines running the Windows Defender alternative. PCs with pre-installed Norton trialware will begin shipping with the Windows 8 launch on October 26.", "Moving on to the Enterprise. The Storage and Server Management segment, which consists of our Information Management and Storage and Availability Management businesses grew 2% and generated revenue of $595 million. Revenue from the Information Management business increased 2% year-over-year, driven by NetBackup and appliances, but offset by weakness in our Backup Exec product. Sales of our backup appliances continued their momentum as we expanded our footprint across more geographies. Customers continue to be attracted to our integrated backup and deduplication offering, which is proving to be an easier to deploy solution with a lower total cost of ownership.", "We are also seeing good traction building for our Backup Exec Appliance which was just launched last quarter. We continue to work through our Backup Exec software challenges. We are focusing on restoring some of the functions and performance characteristics that were available with the older versions of the product. We are making progress, but there is more work to do. Revenue in our Storage and Availability Management business increased 1% year-over-year as we see customers continuing to deploy more mission-critical applications on Linux and virtualized infrastructures. Headwinds from the decline in our customers' usage of the Solaris platform are being offset by increased penetration in both the Linux and Windows platforms. This business continues to be highly profitable, generating strong cash flow for the company.", "The Security and Compliance segment grew 9% year-over-year and generated revenue of $512 million, driven by double-digit growth in all of our emerging security businesses, and our continued leadership in Endpoint Protection. In particular, SEP 12 continued its success in the large Enterprise segment. This was particularly true in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region, where we won several competitive tenders with large governments and corporations.", "Data Loss Prevention was one of our security businesses that recorded double-digit growth. EMEA and Asia Pacific/Japan, both geographies that have traditionally been slower to adopt DLP are now seeing an uptick in demand for our solution, as demonstrated by several large financial services wins. Our Trust Services business continues to perform well, in part because SSL authentication is now being used to protect all interactions with many corporate websites, not just those web pages involving monetary transactions.", "Our Services business grew 7% year-over-year to $64 million in revenue.", "Turning now to total company margins. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margin declined 80 basis points to 84.6%. Given the higher cost of goods sold associated with these businesses, we expect this gross margin trend to continue going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin grew 250 basis points year-over-year to 27.5%. Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenue and lower spending across the company.", "Net income of $322 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45. Improved operating leverage from better-than-projected revenue positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.04. Lower-than-forecasted PC OEM fees accounted for $0.01 per share of improvement and tighter spending across the company accounted for approximately $0.02 of benefit to EPS.", "Continued growth in our subscriptions and maintenance businesses drove deferred revenue growth of 5% year-over-year to total $3.62 billion. We exited the September quarter with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments driven, in part, by the proceeds we received from our $1 billion senior note offering on June 14.", "As we exited the September quarter, approximately 42% of our cash balance resided in the U.S. which includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from the June debt offering that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing in June of 2013. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 23% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. We continued repurchasing our shares during the quarter, spending $200 million of our domestic cash to repurchase 12.1 million shares at an average price of $16.48. Symantec has $483 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan.", "Cash flow from operating activities was lower year-over-year, driven by higher tax and severance payments, as well as lower previous quarter billings which, in turn, impacted September quarter cash collections. Foreign currency movements also negatively impacted operating cash flow by $18 million year-over-year. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $178 million.", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance for the December 2012 quarter. We expect GAAP revenue for the December 2012 quarter to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.75 billion, flat to up 2% on an as-reported basis, and up 1% to 3% in constant currency. Approximately 73% or $1.27 billion of our December quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.17 and $0.19 as compared to $0.32 in the year ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.36 and $0.38 as compared to $0.42 in the year ago period. EPS is projected to be lower due to our decision to spend more in the coming quarter in areas that will better serve our customers' needs.", "In addition, on a year-over-year basis, our interest expense is higher by approximately $0.01 due to our recent debt offering, and we're expecting another $0.02 impact driven by a higher tax rate, foreign exchange movements, and the liquidation of certain accounting entities as we work to further simplify our operating structure. GAAP deferred revenue is estimated to be between $3.765 billion and $3.825 billion, up 3% to 4% on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.30 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.35 and the end-of-period rate of $1.30 per euro in the December 2011 quarter. Our $1.30 per euro assumption reflects a decrease of 4% from our weighted average rate in the year ago period. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 28.5% and a common stock equivalents total for the quarter of approximately 700 million shares.", "And now I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on our upcoming conference events. We will be presenting at the NASDAQ Investor Program on December 5 in London. Lastly, we'll be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on January 23, 2013. For a complete list of all of our investor-related events, please visit the Events section of the IR website.", "Operator, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll move first to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Steve, impressive operating margin during the quarter. I guess I had a couple of questions. One is just from your perspective, where are you still seeing the biggest opportunities to help drive operating margin, you saw good margin improvement? And then secondarily, maybe James, if you can just comment on your comment to spend more in Q3 to serve customers' needs? I guess if you could just help us understand that comment a little more and drilling into that, that would be helpful.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Brent, I think that -- this is Steve. I think I basically had very little to do with the performance of the organization in this last quarter. I give the credit just to the volume, the profitability that came from the volume leverage that came in very stronger than frankly we expected. I think that the big area of opportunity, and we'll talk more about this in January, is we have an inordinate amount of complexity in this company. Complexity and redundancy as we've basically grown through acquisition that we didn't integrate and assimilate and has made us unwieldy in terms of complexity, as I've said, and extra costs. And we're not leveraging our size and scale. So I think we'll talk about that more in January, and I want to answer the second question too, because I made the decision that we needed to invest more money to put out -- to deal with some legitimate and real customer issues and challenges we have supporting our customers. We have been reducing costs in areas that were hurting our position with customers, and I decided to turn that around. And no matter where we come out in January, these are strategy-independent decisions to do a better job of serving our existing customers and start earning some of the goodwill back that we've been eroding over the last period of time. And so I will more than fund for this investment after -- as a result of things we're going to announce in January. So that was my decision to stem the bleeding, frankly, in terms of how we were delivering. A big part of it is technical support because we can't grow if we don't have -- if we don't do a better job supporting our existing customers with our existing products. And so that's what the big investment is, and it's the right thing for our company to do.", "Operator", "Next, we'll move to Brad Zelnick with Macquarie Capital.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Steve, as I listened to James' comments around the Storage and Availability business, it sounds like it's stabilizing. It's relevant to modern computing architecture, like Linux in virtual environments. It generates a lot of cash and maybe isn't as nonstrategic as some might think. Is there anything you've learned over the past 3 months that impacts your thinking as to whether or not this business is essential to Symantec's future?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think I'll tell you more about this, but I think the thing I would share at this point is -- I'm building on your thoughtful comment is that -- we have some of our best IP in the company and most talented resources in this heavily engineered product that we clearly have to diversify or focus resources on solving different customer problems, that in the long term, if we just played business as usual and defined the product as it was, it would be a declining asset. And unfortunately, we've been actually managing it, in my opinion, as a declining asset. So we're thinking now about what would happen if we managed it is an asset that could really help solve important customer problems and focused on it as resources to help us drive accelerated growth, solving new customer problems. Now while I say that, I mean, we've been selling SAMG with a generalist sales force which, I think, may not be the accurate go-to-market strategy given that this is a million-dollar-plus architecture-driven decision. So I think we could execute a lot better, and why I say that, we're still looking at all of the strategic options. But we've never played, in the last few years, our A game in this business using this as, as not necessarily a product, but as a set of assets that we could deploy to solve important customer problems and grow faster. So we're going to compare that strategy against the strategy of inorganic options and see how that fits. So hopefully, that sheds some light on my latest thinking which is in line with your question.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "It does, Steve. And if I can ask a quick follow-up for James. James, on the Consumer business, can you maybe comment a little more about unit versus ASP growth? And specifically, was there a price increase in Norton this quarter and just maybe -- just the general pricing strategy relative to what it's been in the past?", "James A. Beer", "Well, on the NIS and 360 side, we increased renewal pricing about 10 months ago now and added $10 to that. So yes, we have seen some ASP lift as a result of that. We've also seen a nice continuing growth in the emerging Consumer businesses that we have, both the service live help and the backup type businesses as well as mobile. So we're pleased with the overall result from Consumer this quarter.", "Operator", "Next, we'll move on to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Steve, I wonder if you can talk about the SAMG business. It sounds like the headwinds there abated a bit this quarter. I'm wondering if that's a trend that you see sustaining or if that was more of a blip that you're seeing here in the short term?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Walter, I think the -- number one, I still have a lot more to learn. But I think we're still considering all of our alternatives. But I want to conserve -- compare our A game in playing and what would he do to maximize the value of these technologies as opposed to harvest this business. And so I think that's the process we're going through in our strategic review and then we'll share more in January in terms of where we come out. But we're right in the middle of the process. James has some thoughts he wanted to add too.", "James A. Beer", "So this quarter's result, I think it's illustrative of the traction that we're getting around our high-availability product sets in Linux environments, particularly in virtualized environments. And that's a theme that I would expect to continue to build over time.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just around the investment you mentioned at the end [ph] of the quarter, you mentioned tech support, are there any other examples? It does seem like a relatively large investment and maybe something that's hard to do just very short term. But what other types of investments beyond that tech support are you contemplating?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think the primary one is making investments and better serving our customers and partners. And then there's some -- as James talked about, a few cents a share and year-over-year compares where we have tougher compares. And so the investments, I think, are significant enough to mention and the right thing to do. But I wouldn't focus too much on the investment versus the year-over-year compare. And as I said, the big message on this is, we're going to self-fund this investment and future organic investments without any compression in margin.", "Operator", "We'll move next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up question on the Consumer business. Steve, I don't know if you have a view yet, but as you think about transitioning this to mobile over time, do you have any sort of thoughts on routes to market and whether the business is sort of constrained in targeting that growth opportunity? Or any initial thoughts on that would be terrific.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, number one, I think Janice and the team have done a really nice job. I mean, when I came or as a board member I heard and read all the things about, this iceberg is going to melt and for 16-plus quarters in a row, the iceberg has actually been growing. So I think that's a tribute to Janice and her team and how well that team has performed against all these headwinds, even in a shrinking PC market as the world has gone to -- more and more to tablets. So a tribute to her. At the same time, I think our company has put constraints on Janice and her team solving for a margin percent that has hindered our ability to invest in and grow and solve new and exciting customer problems. I think we started to change that philosophy, and I think Janice and her team now are thinking about new customer problems we could solve to grow the iceberg even bigger and faster. I would tell you, and I've talked to Janice about it, I think we spent too much money in our legacy business and not enough money on new things. So I think we expect the iceberg to continue to grow from investing in new things, and I think if we do this right, and I believe we will, we'll self-fund that. And over the long period, I think margins will go up in Consumer too.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually Keith Weiss sitting in for Adam Holt. Digging into the investments into -- or perhaps digging into how you're able to hold down expenses this quarter versus the investments you're making last quarter, how should we think about that from a headcount perspective? I mean, to me it looks like OpEx was basically flat from the June to the September quarter. Were there any headcount reductions in there? And vice versa, for the rather large uptick in OpEx we were looking for in December, what type of headcount increases will we see behind that?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think the simple -- this is Steve. I think the simple answer is, my management team and I know we're going through a transition period until we announce a new strategy and operational plan targeted on 5% sustained organic growth and 30% margins. Our company is too complex. We have lots of opportunity for streamlining. And I think the discussion we've had, number one, is we've had no risks [ph] , and there's been no reductions in force of any size to make these numbers. What we're doing is we're being prudent about what we're investing in, in anticipation of the January announcement. And I think this has just been kind of a smart way to approach the transition between the time I started and what we announced in January. So there's been no master plan other than be thoughtful about the decisions we make every day.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then perhaps as a follow-up, in changing the very top of the sales organization, of getting rid of the worldwide head of sales and having the geo leaders report up to yourself, are there any other changes that go further down in the organization or is that it? It was just really right at the top?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think the news -- there's a couple of other things that are related to that, but I don't think they're material to investors at this point of time. And I think the thing I would say is, I'm quite excited now to take a layer out, have the geo leaders work directly for me so we can move to more quickly to be a more global company versus a U.S. company that ships stuff around the world with global distribution. And I also think, with the geo leaders and a couple sales leaders in the U.S. working directly for me, we'll be able to drive change much faster and help us improve our execution and do a better job for our customers. So I think this is really about those 2 things. So I'm excited to see how the new team steps up and delivers, and I think they've got a great opportunity.", "Operator", "And we'll move next to Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A question on cash flow as you look forward. I know there was some temporary stuff in the September quarter, but when you look at it on the first half of the year basis, it's still down significantly. How should we think about normalized cash flow over the past 6 months and how should we think about cash flow compared to kind of the net income profile as you look forward in the back half of the year?", "James A. Beer", "I think what you can expect from our cash flow growth over time is that it's going to line up approximately with operating profit growth. I think obviously, in any one quarter, you're going to have various ins and outs that are going to drive dislocations, if you will, on a year-over-year basis. But I think that the way to really model this is cash flow growth in line with operating profit growth.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think our quality of earnings is very consistent and high-quality. So we should -- over a longer period, an annual basis, we should see pretty strong alignment.", "Operator", "We'll take Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Siti for Phil Winslow. Steve, you mentioned how you now have a geo-based sales force reporting in to you. Could you comment on what your view of the structure of the sales force is beyond that, particularly in terms of product specific specialization in addition to geo-specific management?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, I think it's a really good question that I'll answer in January. I think that we are in the process, as we've talked about, of looking at our -- relooking at our entire product and market strategy, as well as our go-to-market strategy. And I think you should expect a reasonable good degree of change in the January announcement from what we've traditionally done. I think this announcement that was made today is a strategy-independent announcement that is the right thing to do now, no matter what the strategy is. And so stay tuned for more. And I think this change today will help us move faster in the direction that we want to go when we declare that direction in January. So stay tuned for more details on what's coming because this really is the news today. But there's more news coming in January.", "Operator", "And we'll move to Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just comment on the overall -- your expectations around how Windows 8 may impact the overall Consumer business, how your placements are in terms of OEM relationships and what the dynamics are in terms of your -- sort of the broader competitive landscape in the Consumer?", "James A. Beer", "The first thing I'd point out is how our Consumer business growth is being in significant part driven by the new businesses around mobile, live services and backup. So the traditional linkage between PC shipments and Consumer business growth at Symantec has clearly broken down over the years. So that's how we have been able to sustain very consistent Consumer growth now over several years. So I think that's really important to focus on. That said, as I had in my prepared remarks, our products are absolutely ready for the Windows 8 environment. We feel as though Windows 8 is clearly going to run better, run safer with our software versus the Defender software. So we like where things stand.", "Operator", "Next, we'll take John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My question is on the Americas. When you look at your regions, the Americas was the weakest region in regards to growth on a constant-currency basis. And it really doesn't look like it was a very difficult comp. Can you talk a little bit about that? Obviously, we have issues in other parts of the world. I mean, the macro economy isn't great anywhere, but it was just kind of surprising to see the Americas the weakest.", "James A. Beer", "This is a quarter where obviously the federal government year-end falls. So there was relative versus other years, some softness there in the Federal business. But we'll continue to be competitive across the product set. I was really pleased with the NetBackup performance, for example, and the performance of the security business, overall. The information security businesses, in particular, showed very nice growth, and that was the case across the world. So yes, Americas, less growth overall, but we were pleased with the totality of the picture.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "John, this is Steve. I guess I'd be less sanguine on this than James. I actually don't think we've been performing as well in the Americas as we have in other parts of the world, and I'm expecting that the team will be more focused and execute better going forward. I hope that's right, but we'll see. And as I said, I think as we move toward January, we'll have more news, and I think things that will help make sure that we're growing the Americas in a way that's consistent with the rest of the world. We can do better in the Americas, and we're working on learning what the root cause of this underperformance on a relative basis is. And we'll deal with it as we go forward. But don't know the answers yet, but it's unacceptable performance to me.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Great. Steve, so that -- I don't want to -- I just want to make sure. So it sounds like you think it's more something that you have to fix internally versus -- because we cover a lot of other companies too, I guess I was wondering if we were going to start to see weakness, more weakness from the Americas, but it sounds like you think it's probably something internal right now.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think the majority of our shortfall here relative to other parts of the world is an opportunity for us to be better.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And if I might, just a quick follow-up for James on the guidance, the bottom line implies margin compression next quarter. And I apologize if I missed it, but what's the reason for that? I mean, you actually had some big outperformance this quarter, which is nice to see.", "James A. Beer", "So a couple of themes. First, where we're going to spend some money, where we feel as though -- in completely strategy-independent fashion, we need to deal with some issues that will allow us to do a better job with customers. So that's one item. And the second item really is a variety of nonoperating headwinds year-over-year: tax rate, foreign exchange, interest income -- interest expense, excuse me, so forth. So it's those 2 themes.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So it sounds like it's probably the first one since you're building the business or making some corrections.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "No. Yes, John, this is my decision. We have been reducing costs and reducing service levels by lack of investment in delivering good customer experience for too many of our customers, and that's unacceptable to me. And I need to put my money where my mouth is because the idea of driving sustained organic growth where you have situations where we're not supporting existing customers in a fashion that I'm comfortable with is unacceptable to me. And that's why I said, \"Look, if you define margin expansion in a quarter, I'm guilty here potentially or flat, but I will fund this investment and everything else with the announcement that we make in January.\" And I just don't want to wait until January to make the investment to do right by our customers now.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, that all makes sense.", "James A. Beer", "And I should add that the second theme that I mentioned to you, the nonoperating, that's worth $0.03 year-over-year.", "Operator", "We'll take Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe James, just doubling back on the Consumer stuff, can you give us an idea of how many of the legacy customers or the non-mobile customers have moved or upgraded to the premium suites?", "James A. Beer", "Well, when you look at our 3 primary products for PC security, Norton 360 and Norton Internet Security are almost identical in size now. Norton 360 a little bit larger. But both of those businesses are more than 4x the size of Norton AntiVirus. So that gives you a feel for how we have successfully up-sold our customers, and we believe particularly armed with our eCommerce engine and the analytics that come with that, that we are well-positioned to continue that path.", "Operator", "We'll take Steve Ashley with Robert Baird.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Chaitanya Yaramada for Steve Ashley. License growth decelerated a little bit from last quarter and given Storage Management and DLP executed well, it seems like the Backup Exec business continues to be challenged. Could you just provide an update on how you're tracking and fixing the execution issues you saw last quarter? You said it'll take 2 to 3 quarters to fix, and what we can expect for license growth going forward?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, you're quite right. The Backup Exec is the driver of that license decline year-over-year. And we have continued to work on the products, put out multiple service packs since we were last speaking with each other 3 quarter -- 3 months ago. We do believe that these are self-inflicted wounds, if you will, and we acknowledge that, and we're working really hard to fix the situation. One of the other things that we're doing is very much reaching out to key customers and partners and bringing them into our design process to help us really get it right.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then just your expectations for going forward?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I think, I alluded in my remarks, so there's still much work to do. So I would not expect the Backup Exec license performance to turn around in the next quarter or 2. And I think we've got plenty of work to do, but we're very focused on this, it's a very important product in the portfolio.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "And let me just add to James' thoughtful comments, is that we've changed basically the whole team responsible for this product. So this is unacceptable performance to me, and we're digging out of a hole. We've got some of our best talent in this business now focused on turning this around as fast as we can. This is a business that's going to get back to growth. We're going as fast as we can. The better we do, the faster we'll move. But I'm actually very confident that this business will turn around based on the leadership and talent we've put to fix this problem.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And just a quick follow-up, if I may. We saw a nice rebound in the deals that include both security and storage for $1 million deals, but we saw the $300,000 deals cross-selling continue to decline. Any color on the discrepancy there and what's helping the $1 million deals?", "James A. Beer", "In terms of the $300,000 deal stat, I wouldn't read too much into a single data point. We continue to grow the number of the $1 million-plus deals in totality. And as you rightly point out, for those $1 million-plus deals that involve both security and storage, we're seeing nice growth in overall dollars. And so I think this is just a reflection of the continued relevance of our overall portfolio, and our efforts to continue cross-selling and up-selling. And we think that there is a lot of runway in front of us. A lot of opportunity to continue to do that, and that will be one of the things we'll be focusing on.", "Operator", "And we have Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "James Wesman", "It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. James, just a quick question. What was your LiveOffice contribution guide for the next quarter?", "James A. Beer", "Well, we've now reached the point where we've lapped that acquisition, so we won't be offering projections of revenue for coming quarters.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So it's organic growth now versus [indiscernible] ...", "James A. Beer", "Yes, in essence, organic. But I was pleased with that last quarter result. We had guided to $7 million to $8 million of revenue, you may recall, and we recorded $10 million. So we were pleased. It's illustrative of the momentum that we have in the Cloud archiving area.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll move to Richard Williams with Cross Research.", "Richard T. Williams - Cross Research LLC", "Could you give some geographic color in terms of business opportunities both on storage side and on security?", "James A. Beer", "Well, geographically, just taking a look back at the Q2, I think EMEA really put out a very nice performance, and they did particularly well in the security arena. I would call that out. Within Europe, we had strong performance in the U.K., in Germany and in our emerging regions of the EMEA geography. So very good to see that growth rate, and we continue to think we've got a lot of opportunities in front of us there. And in Asia, where we again recorded a nice constant-currency high single-digit growth rate. So nothing I would particularly offer as to a forward-looking geo split, but we're confident that the international business is going to grow nicely in the coming quarters.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "And I would add that I think this change in structure in having the geo leaders for the Enterprise businesses work directly for me is going to have more voice at the table now as we make decisions so that we will -- as I said, this is a big change in my view in a positive sense for both our customers that are not in North America and for our employees and for our channel partners. I think they will have more voice at the table to make sure we're integrating non-U.S. voices into our product roadmaps and our strategy. And so I would expect our growth outside the U.S. to accelerate because they've got a full seat at the table now, and that's one of the reasons why we delayered the organization and are now -- because so they can help us make sure we're doing the right thing for their geographies.", "Richard T. Williams - Cross Research LLC", "Could you also comment on which products are selling well at the moment and which ones other than Backup Exec that you're focusing efforts to remediate?", "James A. Beer", "Well, on the storage side, NetBackup is growing very nicely across the world, and that's in part because of the growth of our appliances business. Something I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And then on the security side of the business, the information security, growth businesses, things like DLP, Managed Security Services, authentication, they all had very nice performance. So that's a little bit of an overview as to how things are looking.", "Operator", "Next, we have Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Steve, James, you guys had a strong showing in the Enterprise segment, as well as kind of Consumer. But specifically on the Enterprise side, should we be starting to think about Symantec going forward as a share gainer in this market? Without a doubt [ph] that wasn't the deal over the past couple of years.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think it's too early for me to answer that question. I think that you'll learn more about our strategy for that in the January announcement. I think that would be a big change from what we performed in the last few years. And so I would say that my focus at this point, as I said at the Citi Conference in New York is, 5% sustained organic revenue growth. Depending on how you define the markets, that's probably still share loss. But in the next 2 to 3 years, if we can deliver a plan and execute against a plan to deliver 5% or more organic growth, that would be a big positive statement. But that wouldn't be ultimately my end goal. So I think let's stay tuned for the details on that. I mean, you ultimately will have to be the ones to decide whether we'll become a share gainer or not. My short-term metric defined is 2 to 3 years is 5% sustained organic growth.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Operator, if there's no more questions, that's fine. We want to take any questions anybody has, but if there's no more questions, we can -- Helyn can wrap up.", "Operator", "It appears there's no more questions in our queue at this time. That does conclude our question-and-answer session at this time. I'll turn it back over to our speakers for any final or additional comments.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Look, I think, everybody, I said, I'd turn it over to Helyn, but let me just give you a few thoughts. It goes back to my script. I'm actually thrilled with how this team performed in this transition. It performed better than I thought. I think I am the one that made these hard decisions to sacrifice short-term profitability to invest in doing the right thing for the long term. I know that's the right thing for our company. I know it will yield benefits long term. And you got my commitment that I will fund that through the things I'm going to announce in January. So you understand based on my track record how sensitive I am to margin expansion and margin rate improvement, I just needed to make this decision now to keep our customer service at a level that I'll be proud of, as opposed to embarrassed about. And that's one of the advantages when you travel around the world and talk to your employees and customers. You don't grow if you're not delivering for customers, and we have not been doing as good a job as we needed to do, and that's why I'm spending more money here. Strategy independent, which I will fund through the January announcement. So that's my big message. I could have taken the short term and delivered more EPS. That would not have been the right thing to do to create long-term value. And so that's why we made the decision that we made. I think that's a decision that would not have been made in the past, but I know it's the right decision. So thanks for all your support, and I look forward to a much more robust decision or discussion in January after we announce both our new strategy and operating plan. Appreciate your support. Thank you.", "Operator", "Everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today.

We are very excited to have you here join -- Thank you so much. It's wonderful to have you all here to join us today for the strategic direction and third quarter announcement.", "I'm going to be really quick here. I am just going to do some housekeeping comments and then move on. What we'll do is we'll start with the agenda. We will cover earnings very briefly with guidance, and then we'll move onto the strategic direction and the operational plan discussion. And then we'll have a Q&A session. The event is actually being recorded. We'll also have the presentation on our website right after the event.", "In addition, as you know, we will have a lot of comments here today about products and financial statements that are forward-looking. So we do encourage you to please check our risks and uncertainties statements in our filings.", "And in addition, we also talk about GAAP and non-GAAP financial information, and there's reconciliation comments at the -- on the website that you can also refer to.", "And I think that's really it for me today. So I am going to turn it over to our CFO, Mr. James Beer, and he'll kick it off with the earnings.", "James A. Beer", "Thank you very much, Helyn. Good afternoon, everyone. In our December quarter, we were very pleased with the 5% revenue growth rate that we've recorded on a constant-currency basis, and that equates to 4% of organic revenue growth. That's, in fact, the highest percentage growth rate we've seen organically in over 4 years now.", "These results is very much driven by strength in our Europe, Middle East, Africa region, as well as our Trust Services business and our Information Management business. That's the backup and archiving part of our business. And that area particularly helped us build our license revenue growth at 8% year-over-year. Maintenance grew 5% year-over-year, and our enterprise subscriptions business grew 12% year-over-year.", "In terms of our beat the EPS line, it was very much a balance of both revenue, overperformance and, on the expense side, beating there as well. So about a 2/3 revenue, 1/3 expense balance that drove the EPS performance.", "Looking at some of the details of the revenue performance across the business units reflecting growth across our portfolio, on the Consumer side, continued growth as we upsell our customers to our premium suites, as well as continue to grow our emerging businesses, including our mobile business there.", "In terms of the Security and Compliance business unit, in addition to Trust Services, we saw a nice growth from our Managed Security Services and encryption businesses. And in terms of Storage and Server Management, we saw growth on both sides of this business. So first of all, on the back half and archiving side, a very strong performance, 12% growth driven by our NetBackup products. Capital. So, in terms of Storage Management, we saw 1% growth there year-over-year. So that's the second consecutive quarter of growth for that business as we saw more of our customers continue to convert their mission-critical applications to Linux and virtualized infrastructures using our software.", "Services grew, again driven by our Business Critical Services unit. That's the high-end support offerings.", "In terms of cash, we saw 15% growth in cash flow from operations year-over-year and our domestic cash balance represents 26% of the total after setting to one side $1 billion to cover the maturity of our convertible debt that comes due in June later this year. We spent $200 million during the quarter to repurchase shares at an average price of $17.94. Moving on now to our guidance, as we'll be discussing this afternoon, we're entering a period of some transition. So I think it's appropriate for us to be prudent when offering guidance here. We're suggesting revenue and deferred revenue both growing 1% to 3% on a constant-currency basis year-over-year, 73% of our in-period revenue coming from the balance sheet. In terms of earnings-per-share, we're looking for it down just over 1 point at the midpoint of the range. We do expect to record a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, driven by the catch-up effects of the recently reinstated research and development credit that got put back into place earlier this month.", "And in terms of GAAP EPS, that large decline year-over-year is driven by the fact that this time last year, we booked a onetime credit for the profit associated with the sale of our stake in the Huawei joint venture.", "So with that, we have to shift gears and focus the rest of the afternoon on the 4.0 strategy and operational plan. And to introduce that, we're going to show you a short video.", "[Presentation]", "Stephen M. Bennett", "All right, we're stopping at 61%. I'm not quite sure why, but welcome to the unveiling of Symantec 4.0. Before we start today, what I'd like to do is first personally thank all of our employees for delivering just another very, very great quarter. I'd be remiss if I didn't start with that. We've produced better-than-expected results in a time where we've been going through quite a bit of transition as a company and there's lots of uncertainty for our employees.", "I'd also like to start, before we get into forum, by introducing -- we just announced today the creation of an Office of the CEO at Symantec. You see the other 3 members with me here today. Stephen Gillett, who joined us recently; Francis de Souza; and you've already know or met James Beer.", "So let me start by saying when I took this job in July, I said we're going to start with a clean sheet of paper. We were going to evaluate all of the options on the best way to create shareholder value. We commissioned an outside firm to help us, a reputable firm and we looked at a bunch of different scenarios. And I think we have 3 of our board members, in addition to me, are here today. And I think we participated in multiple discussions, looking at all sorts of different portfolio analysis. And at the same time, we commissioned a separate firm to help us put together a transformation strategy to evaluate at full potential or at a reasonable potential how could we best create shareholder value, so we'd be able to compare that against all the other options. We had a board that what I would call the 5 and 30 plan, because that's what we had been messaging.", "We had a board meeting a couple of weeks ago in early January. And the board -- management made a proposal to the board, which the board concurred for clearly the best way for this team to create shareholder value, it is the 5 and 30 plan. And that's what you're going to hear about, that's what Symantec 4.0 is all about.", "So there's a theme that we're using, and it's a very simple theme for Symantec 4.0. It's all about organic growth, an organic growth-focused company that finds, identifies and solves unmet, underserved customer needs that we can solve better than anybody else and drive organic growth. We not only solve them better than anybody else, we can do it in a way that builds competitive advantage and creates sustainable financial performance. If we get that, it's also about expanding margins, it's also about increasing cash flows and a disciplined use of capital allocation. We'll talk more about that as we go through. But this the financial theme for Symantec 4.0.", "And so this is the talk track for today. I'm going to just start with quickly, as you know, I said I was going to go on a around-the-world learning tour. I'm going to share some of the key conclusions and insights from that. Stephen and Francis are going to give you a sense of how we view the market. Francis is going to go through our offering roadmap, which is how some of the things we're going to do to solve these unmet or underserved customer needs better than anybody else and create competitive advantage.", "I'm going to hit a little bit on go-to-market strategy, some of the changes that we're going to make in that area. Then I'm also going to lead into our organization structure, both strategy and structure and the leadership team.", "James is going to come back and talk about how we're going to fund these investments in organic growth, kind of the sources and uses of resource. And then finally, we're going to give you some forward-looking financial review over the next few years. So that's the talk track for today's program.", "I looked at this map when we put it together and it kind of boggled my mind, but this is where I was in the last 6 months. Every location for Symantec around the world with more than 400 employees. And I put on a lot of miles. And I will tell you, I learned an awful lot. It was -- I talked to customers, partners, government officials, third-party outside analysts, investors. Just anybody that I thought could give me insight to help identify 2 things. What are the strengths that we have at Symantec to build on? And what are the areas of opportunity that we could capitalize on to perform as a company at a higher level?", "And the thing I would share is the theme no matter who I talked to anywhere in the world, the themes were very consistent. It's very, very clear. Let's start with what were our assets? And I would like to start by thanking Gordon, John and Enrique for version 1, 2 and 3. They built a portfolio of strong assets that we will use as the foundation for us to deliver for customers going forward.", "We have deep expertise and capability and learned a lot of things about our security expertise and our information management expertise and also some things that we can do that really leverage these across the portfolio and drive some synergy in how we saw these customer problems. Francis will give you some examples on how we're going to find synergies between the information management side of the house and the security side to solve important customer problems.", "Portfolio of leading products. Look, we have great assets that were built by those that came before me. Nine products, 9-point solutions in the leadership positions in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. We've got positions in 98% of the Fortune 100 companies and 93% of the largest financial institutions. We've got over 175 million Norton users on a global basis, all of which are assets that, as the world starts to merge between consumer and business, put us in a position that are very difficult for others to match.", "But the question you'd have to ask or the question I had to ask, \"Well, you've got such great assets, why have you been underperforming over the last period of time?\" And the simple thing I would tell you is while we had the great assets, we didn't have a strategy or an operational plan to focus on delivering value for customers, and that's what Symantec 4.0 is all about.", "So here are the themes on the areas of opportunity. One of the things is despite the fact that we have such great point solutions built mostly from acquisition, while those point solutions add a lot of value to our customers, the fact that we own all of them doesn't add much value. We haven't really integrated the value of these different point solutions to solve important customer problems, and we compete point solution by point solution. And people all over the world told me that that's a great opportunity for you if you could figure out how to break that situation. And everywhere I went, we talked a little bit about this in terms of the additional investment we made in the previous quarter, we weren't delivering technical support experiences for our customers that we were proud of. And that's something that we have to fix across the world. We've made progress but we still have a lot of work to do.", "On our go-to-market strategy, what I would say is simply we have talented people everywhere in the world really working hard, but that our system doesn't work. Or probably better said, we don't have a system. Our process, our technology, the tools we have, our knowledge management, our sales force is not empowered and freed up to sell. They're doing too much administrative stuff, they're doing too much internal negotiation. I ran into a situation where on one multiproduct deal, we had 6 different sets of terms and conditions our salesperson had to negotiate with the customer. We had no single set of Symantec terms and conditions. Just a symptom of a bunch of different acquisitions where we didn't have one set of standard terms and conditions.", "In terms of our people and organization, we had talented people that had been working hard but felt like they were losing, and they've been losing for a while. We were an exporter of talent, and the organization was a bit demoralized. One of the things I heard when I was in Washington which really struck me is somebody said and they're describing Symantec we were a company of promises. And more properly said, probably unfilled promise. And that's what we're going to change in Symantec 4.0.", "So I came off the bench, after being on the bench for four years, because I thought this company had great assets, tremendous opportunities and was underperforming against the opportunity. I can tell you emphatically, the opportunities are bigger than I ever dreamed. There's a lot of work. I would tell you also that there's a lot of hard work to get there. The challenges and what has to be done is more than I would have expected, but the opportunities are bigger and the talented people here are way better than I would have expected.", "So we have some nice tailwinds. We're in markets. We're fortunate to be in markets that are growing very quickly, with a talented and now much more engaged workforce. And we're just starting. We're only 6 months into this. And I think that's what it's going to take for us to transform Symantec.", "But because of this, the world is changing quickly. We have tough competitors. We'll talk about that. So this won't work to be an evolution. We can't get there through incremental steps to try and move to where we need to be. So no evolution, Symantec 4.0 is all about a revolution.", "And so we're going to get into the content today. You're going to see that we're going to lead a revolution to focus on delivering more value for our customers, whether they're consumers, whether they're businesses, small business, large enterprise or countries all around the world. And doing that, we're going to deliver at a much higher level than we have traditionally for customers and partners, for our employees and for our investors.", "So with that tee up, let me turn it over for a little market backdrop to Stephen Gillett.", "Stephen E. Gillett", "Thank you, Steve. I think it was Confucius that once said, \"May you live in interesting times.\" And if I put my voice-of-a-customer hat on, which is what I'm going to take you on a little bit of a journey with, I would be hard-pressed not to say that the information and the security and the data world that we live in today is probably, if not the top, definitely one of the top 3 areas to be in for the -- and frontiers to be working on over the next decade. And I've seen this from multiple hats, multiple angles, and I want to share with you a little bit of that at the voice of the customer.", "So a little bit about this presentation. I want to make sure we talk about, which is what is it like to be on the other side of Symantec? What is it like to have been a customer for 15-plus years of our company? And on that journey, I want to share with you some of those insights and some of the learnings about what's happening out there in the world.", "When you talk to CIOs and you talk to leaders across the industry, you find now there's actually a convergence of themes that tend to emerge. Yes, you hear about economic uncertainty. You hear about the changes in the EU. You hear about Greece and the financial crisis. You hear about the U.S. and the debt. You hear about all these different things that are top of mind for business executives across the country and, frankly, across the world.", "And it's important to note that as this global concern is emerging with economic uncertainty, coupled closely to that is the concern of information security. With all the new ways people and organizations and governments are working to protect the information of citizens, of employees and of individuals, it is a key theme of what it is we see in this new frontier.", "When you look at this, you see the full emergence of digital and social media. Four, 5 years ago, we were talking about digital as the new frontier and the social -- interesting social graph is going to emerge. When you fast-forward to 2013, that era is upon us, right? It is upon us in new and, in some ways, unexpected ways. You read about things like the Arab Spring and you watched that unfold on TV as countries across the Near East revolt and change their constituencies, which ultimately change their governments. You look at the role of Twitter and Facebook and these social medias which governments try to stop with magic red buttons to kill Internet access in the country emerge and overthrow regimes that have been in place, in some cases, for decades. You see that the intellectual property of our company, everything you do and invest in R&D over decades is just one tweet away from the world to know it.", "And you say with all of these information, all of these access, all of the power of what used to be inside data centers, inside server rooms, in the palms of people's hands, whether they're in the company or individuals, whether they're government or citizens, whether they're friendly or hostile is the era by which we operate, and this is part of that frontier.", "If you look at the concepts that we're now starting to fully realize with the Cloud and emerging analytics, you hear these areas. What is big data? What does this mean? It's exploding, 60% year-over-year growth in enterprise data today. Okay, you hear a lot about that, but what does that actually mean? How do I as a business or an individual or as a government use that data for good? How do I make sure it stays in the right hands of the people that own it or are authorized the use of it?", "You look at the ability for enterprises and organizations using packaged software, using analytics and Cloud technology to be able to simulate and maneuver business situations before they ever take place, the ability and the power to do that using big data. You see the rise of NoSQL and Hadoop clusters. You see the products that companies are using to bring this data to actionable intelligence, which is framing that as the new strategic data frontier as part of this.", "This is all part of the frontier by which we operate as an organization. And as I believe one of the most exciting, it also is demanding that enterprise IT change and evolve the way they've offered their solutions and services to companies worldwide. And we're going to talk about that. Francis, in particular, will talk about that to a great detail a bit later.", "So as unnerving as some of these technologies and powers can be, the excitement of being able to participate and understand and be stewards of good in this world, I think, is a huge task for Symantec. It's something I'm proud to be a part of and I know that many thousands of employees are proud to work here everyday, supporting.", "If you look at the enterprise view of that voice of the customer, you really start to see some additional themes emerging. We'll talk just about a few. I mean, this could be a whole presentation in and of itself.", "You see the hybrid of Cloud, both personal enterprise emerge, which are redefining the boundaries of what's happening. Employees are going into a Best Buy on Friday or on Amazon.com, they're buying an iPad, they're going to the Apple Store. They take that iPad into work on Monday. They go to their IT support person and they say, \"I want to get all my data on this. What's the corporate policy for that?\" And in many cases, the IT department will struggle with what to do. They have security, data retention, what happens when the employee leaves, how do we remotely wipe the device? What about encryption? The list goes on and on about things that enterprise IT has to worry about. So that boundary between what was traditionally a sacred ground of the enterprise and the consumer is now very porous, and organizations and companies have to adapt very quickly to that.", "You see the convergence and adoption of enterprise technologies into the consumer. We've all heard the trend, right? We've all heard the buzzwords, the consumerization of IT, things that you buy in the store online brought into the workforce. But there's another frontier which is what is called the IT-ization of the consumer. How many of you as individuals worry about your identity, worry about encryption? How many of you used products that store your information in the Cloud? How many of you download content and use iTunes in different frameworks from Amazon all through to access and share your personal information, from credit card to content selection to reviews and ratings to medical records. How many of you use services? I'm a big fan of Mint.com, which is storing all my financial data and aggregates it all from across the Internet. That IT-ization of the consumer, the fact that you as an individual have to care about encryption and privacy law and what information is being used for what is a part of this new frontier.", "Another notion is the sophistication of people that are actually going after this information. One of the most fascinating things that I've had to work with as an IT professional most of my career is the sophistication of these attacks, how they're trying to get information that want to use it for no good. You see individuals doing it, you see digital arms of the organized crime units doing it, you see governments doing it. And the sophistication and triangulation of how information is being sought after by those that don't want to do well with it is a real and is one of the most talked about discussions in the enterprise world. Francis will talk about how our products can uniquely work to solve and partner with you to fix and protect you against that.", "But all of that gets coupled with the other notion of the technology enterprise landscape, which is there's a huge transfer and a huge porous of what was traditional to what is new. The consumer world, in many ways, is defining the future of IT from the applications to the devices, from the computing architectures. It used to be bring your own device. Now it's bring your own whatever, right? Your application, your Cloud, your social graph, your mobile. All of the things that need to go into that are now being defined by the consumer.", "And more importantly, that is wrapped in what I'm calling today a dispersion of authority. It used to be just 5 or 6 years ago that the IT department was kind of a gatekeeper of everything technology within the enterprise. And over time, as marketing or legal or supply chain or any of the other groups have went out and partnered with nontraditional IT vendors, they've brought those technologies into the organization. In fact, they've dispersed that IT authority over the last 5 or 6 years to be much more level than it was in the last 30 years.", "I was reading that Gartner report, I found fascinating that by 2017, the CMO in the organization will control more IT spend than the CIO. And if you look at that convergence and that dispersion of authority, it is a key element intended of the next frontier that we talked about.", "When you go fast-forward from enterprise and the voice of the customer, you have to, in order to really paint a picture, understand that this doesn't stop in the 4 walls of your company. We all travel, we're global citizens in many cases. We travel the world for business, for pleasure. We bring our devices with us. We switch to international plans on our smartphones. We plug in to ethernet ports in foreign countries and hotel rooms that have very American sounding names. All of these things are being contributed -- or are contributing to the new flat world of business.", "When you look at that, you have to realize that governments are responsible for protecting their nation's critical infrastructure, which includes all the private assets. In fact, in the U.S., the latest stat is about 80% of the critical infrastructure is owned by private institution. The information we share as governments try to get more efficient. Here I am moving to California again for the second time in my life and I have automated driver's license. I'm doing things online to get permits. I'm trying to transfer my medical records and my health care coverage, right?", "It's automated, it's centralized. All of that information about me and my family is stored somewhere. And as governments try to get more efficient by using technology and adopting different IT platforms to make that a more seamless transaction wrapped around that comes a responsibility and, frankly, a necessity to protect that information to make sure it doesn't get into the hands of those that would do harm.", "You see, and it ties back into the economic uncertainty, when governments are under pressure to cut non-mission critical activities in government, they actually go after discretionary things like IT, like infrastructure. I remember talking to the CIO of the U.S. Government a couple of years ago, and he was talking about all of these multibillion-dollar projects that they had going, in which some were late, some were getting cuts, some he had to figure how to streamline. And he was reaching out to CIOs in the industry to get an understanding of faced with several of these high-priority projects, which ones would you sequence in what priority order? So as enterprise deals with the realities of limited resources and limited funding as do governments across the world, I think that's a hugely important element of the frontier.", "As the government seek out this nimble nature to access information, it sometimes comes at a cost. You saw the video, which stopped about 60% in. But if you were to finish that, you'll actually see some of those elements emerge where in many ways we're playing catch up here. We're playing -- we're going after the bad guys who tend to bring the biggest and most advanced opportunities for us to engage with our products.", "The attacks on citizens. This isn't about something that happens at work. You leave home and now you're an individual again. These attacks, these institutions are seeking you out where you go, the business traveler, at home, online, at work. It's a very porous, as we talked about. You're no longer just an employee of a company or an individual or a citizen. You're going to see that these threats are emerging that span and cross the various frontiers and the various traditional silos. You're an individual now that can be sought after no matter where you are in the world, no matter what company you're in, whether you're an individual, business person or traveler. We'll talk about that a little bit later.", "The last part of this is the fifth frontier. After land, sea, air and space, cyber is now talked about as kind of the fifth domain of warfare going forward. I've met with several individuals, both business leaders, local politicians, state politicians, national politicians, and I've been told just anecdotally that the #1 issue talked about in D.C. after the economic situation is the cyber threat that we all face. And governments are increasingly worried and concerned about the ability to engage in this as an equal or as superior against the people that would do harm.", "And so when you wrap all of these together, the voice of the customer, the enterprise, the consumer, the government, the country, it starts to paint a very different picture that we thought about security over the last decade.", "There's a couple of concepts that I think are important to really lay out as we get into talking about the rest of the Symantec 4.0 strategy. The first one all of you may have heard about is called the Internet of Things. This was a term coined, I believe, in 1999. And the whole concept was in the late '90s, anything done on in terms of information online was done by a person. You rated a review of a movie, you took a picture, you sent e-mail. The content that was created in the early days of the Internet was people created. Everything you did as an individual online. Now, we have the Internet of Things where in 2013, in '12 and '13, for the first time, there will be more devices connected to the Internet than people. And when you have devices talking to the Internet and sharing information, your router at home for your cable provider, your cellphone's talking to the Internet right now, your tablet, your e-reader, your laptop, those devices now are having a discussion with the Internet, with -- sharing information of which you may or may not know about as an individual, depending on how much you take the time to understand that. RFIDs, 2D bar codes. As you know, I worked in Starbucks for several years and we did a mobile payment in the store. That is 2D bar code technology that you're using that knows about you and knows what you do and your preference, your loyalty. It knows when your birthday. I had a birthday on Sunday, it gave me a free drink. I was really happy with my free drink.", "The devices are now outnumbering people, and I think this is an important thing to notice when you talk about the security nature and the security transaction between those devices and the online world.", "Mobility. This is another frontier we talked about 8, 9 years ago. That is now fully upon us. Mobile devices will pass PCs as the most commonly used device to access the Internet this year. Fascinating, one of the stats is by 2015, 80% of handsets in the developed world will be smartphones with more computing power than some PCs had as much as 8 years ago. Think about the power of the citizen with this kind of tool in their pocket. It's fascinating. I remember reading the stat where if you lose your wallet, it takes you about 30 minutes to realize it. But if you lose your phone, it takes you about 3 minutes. What's more important to you now? And with mobile wallet and all the things that are happening, it is absolutely the new device of the future.", "The personal Cloud. I use Cloud technology. It accepts all the data on my computer, puts it up there. I can get devices. I can get the access of the information on my device, my work computer and get on my laptop. All of that stuff is now stored in the Cloud. I came to Symantec. I said, \"What's our solution for that in the IT department? How can I get off this personal Cloud that I have and use the enterprise Cloud?\" And while we have the offering here, my personal Cloud was 500 gigabytes and my corporate one was about 5 gigabytes because I had to try to figure out how to squeeze. With a 5-year-old kid, it's hard to get rid of those pictures. So the convergence here between the digital life and what you store online and what you do in your personal world has crossed the boundary now and it's readily used in the enterprise.", "And then we talk about these computing ecosystems, right? These are not just I have a PC, and I do everything on and I dial up to the Internet and I go online. These are entire ecosystems. iOS is an ecosystem. Android, Windows is now emerging, WIM [ph]. They all have ecosystem with apps, privacy, security, malware and virus issues in some of them. All of those ecosystems now compete for you as the individual.", "It's hard to be in one ecosystem with our family, for example. We have Amazon Kindles. We have laptops, Samsung. We have iPhones. I have an Android device. I have a new Windows one I'm testing. I have a Linksys router and I have a Comcast cable. I have a Samsung TV with smart apps. I log in to my TV now. My 4-year-old walks up to the TV and expects to be able to swipe on it, all right? This is a new world than even a few years ago. And all of that has information. My credit card, my purchase history, movies I like, preferences I like as an individual. Those ecosystems are very powerful. The more you participate in them, the more they know about you, the more information they have about you.", "And so as we bring those things together into 4.0 for Symantec, you start to piece several things together. One, the porous nature by which information is flowing across enterprise, individuals, governments and your personal world. Those boundaries are now taken down. Two, the frontier over the next decade that we participate in is one of the most exciting and thrilling and hugely opportunistic as a company, as an individual, as a professional, as an investor. I think we are sitting in the middle of that. And three, the ability for us to uniquely participate in that offering with our products and services. And I think you'll see that later today, it's very exciting.", "So on that note, I'm going to pass it over to Francis who's going talk about some of those product offerings and how we can uniquely participate and lead in many of these areas. Thank you.", "Francis A. de Souza", "Thank you, Stephen. Thank you. Well, the trends that Stephen talked about are having profound impacts, as you can imagine, in how we think about protection as an industry.", "One powerful idea is that the industries we participate in are all interconnected. Recently, we were tracking and investigating an incident where a businessman had his personal smartphone compromised as he went through the security line in a foreign airport. Now what happened is the attackers then compromised the corporate credentials he stored on his personal smartphone, and they used those credentials to compromise his company. And from his company, they then staged an attack on a government agency. And so what started out as a consumer hack became a corporate compromise, became a national cyber attack, right? So it's all interconnected.", "Next, as we think about the world today, it's very clear that we, as an industry, need a new model for protection. So as we think about how the protection model evolved, it really started as being very compute-centric. What that meant though was that for consumers, for example, as an industry we focused on protecting the PC. We focused on securing the PC, on backing up the PC, on performance-tuning it, but it was really all about the PC. And in the enterprise, similarly, it was really about the big 3. It was about protect the endpoints, protect the data center and protect the corporate network. That's what we did as an industry.", "But as you heard, the digital landscape is changing, right? With the addition of mobile devices, bring your own devices, web services, the Internet of Things, personal health devices, web platforms and in emerging software-defined data center, you've seen the digital landscape expand enormously both for consumers and for enterprises. And because in security we're dealing with an active opponent, every time the landscape expands, it becomes a battleground. And so as we think about protection, we need to think about where we're putting in the control points to protect this landscape.", "And what's clear is that what used to be an enterprise world of 1 control point, the PC, and a corporate world of 3 control points has now expanded to well over a dozen control points that all need to be protected.", "Now as we think about a protection model, it turns out that it's not that the new area, the new control point replaces the old one. It's not like you won't have firewalls anymore because you have BYOD. What happens is this is all additive, right? And so you need a new control point every time your landscape expands.", "Now what's happened over the last few years is that there has been growth in security, for example. But a lot of that growth has been taken up by startups that have formed new categories around these new control points. If you look at market share numbers, for example, in 2006 the top 5 security companies, we had 60% share of the security market. By 2010, our share had dropped to 44%, all 5 of us had lost share, and all of that share growth happened by startups, right? So new control points get created, new security gets -- new security categories get created, but a lot of that is taken up by startups.", "But startups are not the only companies we compete with to protect this new environment, right? We also face, on the other side, the stack providers. The providers of the big stacks for enterprises that increasingly are looking to put the various types of protection, whether it's backup or high-availability or security, into their platforms. That's true if you're building an operating system like Windows or Apple iOS. It's true if you're building a virtual ware like VMware or even a storage stack. And so we face competition from the startups that are looking to get into the new categories, as well as the stack providers. And then there are other companies like us. We call ourselves specialists. No other name than that's sort of what we do. That focus on a particular area. So there's CommVault in back up, for example. McAfee in security.", "So as we think about this landscape then, there are few things that are important to remember. One is across the different areas of protection, this is a growth industry, right? So as the landscape expands, there's more you have to back up. You back up your physical environment, you back up your virtual environment. There's more that you need to secure. The challenge is how should you get your share of this buy.", "So in thinking about our strategy, we spend a lot of time talking to customers, talking to analysts and putting together our plan around what does it take to win. And what we heard is there are a few things that are essential in the protection industry. The first thing we heard loud and clear is that it's important that you deliver a best-of-need offering. And what does that mean? That's a combination of a best-of-breed technology that does the protection that you're about but that meets the particular need of that customer. Now that could be tailored for the size of customer, so a large enterprise versus a small business. It could be the way they want to consume the offering, right? So they may want it as a service or as an appliance or software. Or it could be that they have particular legal requirements that they have to meet. They could be in a country, for example, where you offer an online backup service but the data have to stay in their country. So they're telling us that best-of-need is important.", "Second we heard loud and clear, that scale matters in the industries we're in. And scale matters in a number of different ways. Having a large global intelligence network actually does matter in terms of delivering better security, whether you're a consumer that's buying that security offering or a military that's buying that consumer -- that security offering. So scale matters in terms of delivering quality of protection. It also matters to enterprises in terms of being able to support them as they move globally. So scale is very important in these industries.", "Next they told us, and this is an area I think we have been challenged with historically, that integration matters and will matter even more so going forward. I spoke to the Chief Information Risk Officer of a very large financial services firm who said, \"Look, Francis. I have 65 different security products in my environment that I'm responsible for.\" And he estimates that he spends a full 1/3 of his $300 million a year budget deploying and operating those systems. It's an awful lot of money. And what frustrates him is not just the amount of money he has to spend for a task that frankly he thinks we should do. But increasingly, he's saying it's hard and harder to find security professionals to do the job even if he had the money. And so more and more, as the threat landscape gets more toxic, people are going to want this integration to be done by the vendors.", "And then cross-platform. If you go into a house, you've heard Android and the various flavors of Android are still the market share leaders in smartphones. People have iPads in the house. They have Macs and they have PCs. It's a heterogeneous world. You go into the enterprise and it's clear that not only it is a heterogeneous world, but it's getting more heterogeneous going forward. And the truth is whether you're a consumer, a small business, a large enterprise or a government, you don't want to run different protection technologies on every flavor of platform that you have in your environment. So we heard very clearly is that to win long-term in protection, you need to deliver best-of-need offerings that offer scale, integration and work cross-platforms.", "So now we look at this and think about so how does this play out for startups, for us, for the large stack providers? And the truth is we feel that while startups will actually do very well in individual categories as the categories emerge and get to scale quickly because in protection you actually get adoption faster than you would in other IT industries, they'll be challenged to be the big providers of protection, right, because of all the scale that they will need to deliver to offer the entire offering.", "For the stack providers, the big challenge is going to be around being cross-platform, right? It's hard for them to be credible in providing protection in platforms outside their own. And so we feel that there's a real opportunity in front of us if we look at this list and deliver against this list for our customers to really take advantage of the growth that's happening in the various flavors of the protection industries.", "So what's our plan to do that? What we're doing is really focusing on a plan that helps us to better meet customer needs through internal innovation and diving faster organic growth. And I'll talk about some of the highlights of our plan.", "The first thing we're doing is really looking at how we're spending our R&D dollars. Overall, we expect our R&D dollars to go up as we do more R&D to drive organic innovation for our customers. We're also going to do a lot of reallocation though. As we look at our best and brightest and make sure that we have them focused on creating intellectual property that solves the problem that matters most to our customers and will drive growth. So there will be a lot of reallocation of our talent against the hard problems. We'll do more advanced research to deliver the protection capabilities that are necessary. And in addition to focus on more innovation, we'll do a lot more around leveraging innovation.", "And that's a change of model for us. Historically, what we've done is we've created intellectual property within a product, and we've leveraged that IP for that product. We're changing how we do things and really focusing in a concept around centers of excellence where we create technologies and common components that can be leveraged across products.", "Now we have some examples where we've seen some success that we'll build on. For example, the file system technology that came out of our SAMG group. Tremendous technology and we've seen good success, and we took that technology and put it into our DLP, our Data Loss Prevention offering, our security offering. And what that technology allows us to do is to actually understand who's been accessing important files in your environment, again in SAMG technology in a security context. We're also looking to deploy that technology in our integrated backup offering. And we believe that allow us to set a new bar in the scalability of our integrated backup offering.", "The idea though is that instead of doing this as one-off integration between products, we'll focus on creating centers of excellence and use those technologies across our portfolio, in a lot of cases to solve new unmet customer needs. And this isn't just an internal concept. We're going to take these centers of technology and look to leverage them through partners.", "So I'll talk about one example is network security. I know I'll get this question in the Q&A, so I'll address it now. We're not getting into the network security business. But you wonder, right? If you look at what's happening in that business, that business is evolving from protecting just the protocols to being more application-aware. That's the big move, right, to go into this next generation network security.", "But you ask yourself, we have this tremendous Data Loss Prevention technology that's actually content-aware. So more than knowing what application you're using, we can tell you what the content is. It may make sense to leverage that technology through a partner ecosystem to go to the next next-generation of network security. So those are things we're thinking through to say, \"Look, we have these tremendous technologies that we can create in Centers of Excellence and leverage across our portfolio and through a partner ecosystem.\"", "And then finally, we're taking a 0-based mindset view of our entire portfolio. So what we've done is we've put all products together for the first time, and I'm responsible for that group, and I'm looking across the entire $1.8 billion spend to understand do we have the right level of investment, the right level of resources focused on our biggest growth opportunities?", "Next, we'll also look at improving the customer experience in using our products better and easier. We heard loudly and clearly that there is enormous value for our customers and opportunity for us in improving the customer experience when they're using our products and when they're supporting our products. And we have a number of initiatives underway to improve that. I'll just pick on a couple.", "One is, for example, we're simplifying the licensing of our products. We have over 41 different meters by which we control the licensing of our products. We don't need that many. We're going to make it simple for people to consume our products, to know how much of our products they've consumed and to buy more products using things like in-product licensing, for example.", "We also have this great technology that we use in our Norton products today, which is around self-healing. So it does a proactive diagnosis of issues that your product may be having and then remediates the issues without you ever knowing about it. That's great technology, and our Norton products will look to leverage that now across our enterprise portfolio to improve the experience the customer has.", "Similarly, we're investing, as you've heard before, in our technical support capabilities to improve the experience there, expanding the channels, for example, by which our customers can talk to us today. The vast majority, over 80%, of the support is done over the phone. We think there is an opportunity to actually give customers the level of support they need in their moment of need through their channel of choice.", "Next, we're going to focus on right for me offerings. So what we've heard from customers is that while they like the core technologies we offer, in a lot of cases they actually need the offerings tailored for them. It could be, again, I said, if you're a small business, you may want to consume our products a certain way, maybe in the form of a web service. If you're a consumer, you may want it one way. So depending on the size of the customer, we'll offer tailored offerings. But we're also being told that for certain geographies we need to offer tailored offerings. I've talked about the fact that, for example, if you're consuming a web service that stores data, you may have in-country residency requirements for that web service. And then we're looking at offering tailored products for specific industries where you need a customization of the product, a more specialized product. For example, telcos are a vertical that we're looking at where we'll offer a more tailored capability for that industry.", "And then next we're hearing loudly and clearly and we'll offer our customer is the ability to consume more and more of our capabilities across deployment options. So software, appliance, Software-as-a-Service and, increasingly now, a hybrid between those form factors.", "Now, in addition to focusing on improving our existing offerings, I'm very excited about the work we've been doing over the last few months by talking to customers and understanding the bigger jobs that they're hiring our customers to solve. And to address those, we're going to be launching a set of new offerings that are broader, more integrated and target higher value customer needs. Now, the reality is customers will be able to buy our products as they are today, and they will be able to do that going forward. They'll be able to buy these products, they'll be able to upgrade, they'll be able to maintain them but they'll also be able to buy our capabilities through these broader offerings. And the idea is it will also allow them to turn on capabilities as they need so they'll be able to step from point products to the broader offerings.", "So let me paint that in a little bit more. When we talk to customers about the jobs that they're hiring our products to do, it turns out that they said there are 3 categories, 3 areas that they're hiring our products for. The first category was user productivity and protection. And in their words, they said make it simple for me to be productive and protected at home and at work. Next, for information security. They're saying keep my business safe and compliant. And information management was all about keep my business information and applications up and running.", "Now if you look at our existing portfolio, you can see how it maps into those 3 areas. This is just a sample list. The reality is we have over 150 different products, so I didn't show the entire list. But you can see how some of our core offerings map to those focus areas. Now we're going to continue to develop and make those offerings available to our customers going forward. But in addition, we're going to offer 10 new offerings over the next 6 to 24 months. And the 10 new offerings are going to be an aggregation of capabilities across those customer needs. So I'll give you 3 examples.", "The first one is an offering that we're calling mobile workforce productivity. It's our working name. And the idea here is that if you talk to customers about their end point real estate, and I'll give you an example. There was one large pharmaceutical company, and as the CIO was describing his real estate he said, look, we have 60,000 PCs. We have about 7,000 Macs. We have 15,000 iPads and over 10,000 Android smartphones in their environment that he was aware of. And he said what he needs is an offering that allows him to let people use those devices but, at the same time, protect the business. And he had a number of regulations that he has to deal with being in the pharmaceutical industry. Now as we talked about what it would take to deliver what he needed, there's a whole set of products that he would have to buy today. Now you can buy those products from us or you can buy from a set of vendors, but you can see it's about a dozen different offerings from the market today that you would have to buy to enable that CIO or any CIO like him to be able to meet the needs of managing their end point real estate. Or the idea is you can buy a single offering from us that brings all those capabilities together and gives you a single holistic view around what's happening across all your endpoints, endpoints, PCs and Macs but also smartphones and iPads, whether they're owned by you or owned by the employee but plugging into your network.", "And here's also the real power of having Norton. Because one of the things that we heard from customers was they would love the idea to let people use their own devices but require them to have Norton on it. Because if you know that somebody is protected by Norton, well then, frankly, you have a higher level of confidence and may give them more privilege in accessing your environment than if you didn't know what they had.", "Let me give you another example of an offering that we're looking to launch. This is around an information security service. We talked about the environment where the CIRO said he had over 65 security products, right? And one of his challenges was even with those 65 products, he said, \"I don't know at any point how secure I am. I don't know what my security posture is. I don't know what my compliance posture is.\" And so what we're looking to do is address that problem. So this is a service that actually looks across your environment, takes in feeds from Symantec security products, but partner security products or other third-party security products, and takes in logs from products that aren't security products at all, your server logs, your endpoint logs. Also, it takes in a feed from our Global Intelligence Network and gives you visibility around what's going on. And in addition to doing the risk analysis and correlation, we'll have our own threat analysts that will also look at escalated events and tell you whether you need to wake up at 3 a.m. in the morning because you're having a real incident or it's something that we could have remediated for you.", "This offering also then, we believe, addresses a very important customer need and builds a strong competitive advantage because this is hard to replicate. I'll give you one more example of an offering we're looking at around business continuity. Probably the best way to do this is go through an example, right?", "So if you look at an enterprise running an application like SAP. Now, that's a big app. Typically runs across multiple tiers, right? The front end tier usually runs on Linux, the middle tiers typically run on Windows and the database tier, typically an Oracle database, will run on Solaris. Now SAP is typically a mission-critical app for a company, and so they want to make sure that it remains highly available and performant. Now to do that, companies need lots of technologies, right? They need to make sure that they're backing up the Linux environment, the Windows environment, the Solaris environment. They need to make sure they're backing up any of those layers that have been virtualized. They need clustering. They need replication. They need disaster recovery. And because they have so many pieces, they need something to orchestrate it all. For example, if it goes down, they need to make sure that the database goes down last and comes up first. That's an awful lot of complexity to manage that SAP implementation and make sure it's running consistently.", "To do that, they could buy all those offerings or the idea is buy a single business continuity offering from us that has all those capabilities. This is hard to do. It solves an important customer need, and we believe builds competitive advantage for us going forward.", "So those are examples of the 10 offerings that we're looking at aiming to bring to market in the next 6 to 24 months. What's in it, overall, for our customers? We'll talk about how we think this really transforms how they think about Symantec. But to do this, we have to enhance the capabilities we have. I talked about the centers of excellence concept that we're building internally.", "But to do this, we have to enhance the capabilities we have. I talked about the Centers of Excellence concept that we're building internally. There's work we have to do to expand those Centers of Excellence. Today, we have 23 different Cloud platforms that are on the different Cloud services we have. We're changing the model to create a single Cloud platform that can be accessed by the different Cloud services. That will provide for a faster delivery of new services and more consistent user experience and, frankly, eliminate a lot of redundancy.", "We're looking to expand our hardware supply chain as we sell more of our appliances around the world. We're also building a capability we're calling the information fabric. And what this does is it gives you information about what the data is that you have in your backup, in your archives, on your end points. This is a powerful concept. Because if you know what the data is across your enterprise, you can be more intelligent about what you need to back up and store, how long you need to keep data. And you can be better positioned from a security perspective, as you know what the information is that's moving around your enterprise and in and out of your enterprise.", "We're also looking to expand our Global Intelligence Network from a security perspective and enhance the big-data, back-end capabilities. Today, we believe we have one of the largest big-data, back-ends from a security perspective. We leverage 1.7 trillion pieces of information and munge [ph] data on over 100 million URLs to deliver a verdict every 6 hours. That's good. But the reality is, as we look forward and we look at this Internet of Things that's churning out so much data, we know we'll need to invest to drive that capability forward.", "So how does this all benefit customers? We believe this is a big step forward in terms of our ability to meet the things that customers told us were important. We'll solve bigger problems from them -- for them and stop them from being the integration between our products. We'll deliver right-for-me offerings, so that they can consume these capabilities in the way they want. We'll improve their customer experience by making it better and easier. And it will allow them to buy how they want to buy from us, by improving our licensing programs and the way we offer our capabilities.", "Now before I turn it back over to Steve, I wanted to say -- make some personal thoughts. Look, it's a real privilege for us to be in a company that's driven by a mission like we are. The team is incredibly energized by what's been going on here over the last few months, right? They'll focus on solving the bigger customer problems rather than moving point products forward feature by feature. They'll focus on fueling innovation to drive organic growth. They'll focus on collaboration, whether it's structural and putting all the products together, whether it's the partner meetings that Steve and I are doing to look for the deep set of partners that we feel, by working together, we can bring real value to our customers. Those things are incredibly powerful, and we think they'll make a very big difference. Thank you.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Before we get into the go-to-market, I wanted to just take some thoughts and share how we're thinking about the portfolio. Francis, now, gave you a sense for how we were thinking differently about applying technology to solve our most important customer problems. So as part of our 4.0 strategy process, we looked at everything in our portfolio, every product, every technology. And we use a 2-key criteria that you can see on the slide, as a standalone or something that we could integrate, like file systems, into an offering that will solve new and important customer problems.", "We put everything through there, and we have nothing to announce today. This process is going to be ongoing, and we'll deal with anything that doesn't fit. This is where we are today. It's an ongoing process. But what I really wanted to share, and you'd expect this, as we continue to look at all the business and things we've done. But one of the reasons I picked 4.0 is because with the new version, sometimes we all have to change our software and think differently than we did in the past. Our leadership team and our employees are going through some of that now, as we roll out 4.0 thinking in the company. I would also say that we're going to have to communicate in different ways with you as we go forward.", "For instance, we don't have a Consumer business anymore in Symantec. And I'd like to thank Janice for all the things she did over 10 years to build a great solid asset for the company. As we talk about the new structure, and I'll get into this, but my need to functionalize the company so that we could move faster on the things as opposed to through the decentralized silos that we have, we concluded that we didn't have the right role for her. So she's going to leave Symantec, and that's a loss for us. But it's logical for her to move on to be a CEO somewhere, given her history and track record.", "So we're not going to have a Consumer business. We're going to have an end point business. We're going to organize our company around our customer problems. We're going to have to change segment reporting. So we'll work through all of the ways to do this. We're not going to have SAMG business anymore. We're looking at SAMG as technology that can solve important customer problems. So I'll share more of the details there, but this is a big and exciting change for our company. We know this will be part of the transition. But the goal is to leverage all of our products, services, technology to solve higher-order customer problems and drive faster, organic growth.", "So a couple of other things. First, on a simplified go-to-market strategy, this won't take us long. The important thought here is that we're going to add, Francis referred to this, a new vertical business. There's 4 verticals that we're going to focus on. The key there is where we need specialized offerings to better meet the needs of customers, where our product -- our individual products don't meet the needs and there's 4 we've identified. One is national public sectors, where you need things like certifications to sell. We've talked to, Francis mentions Telco. The Telco part isn't the sell-to part of Telco. It's more of the sell-with. I've met with -- talked with people at Comcast and Vodafone. They actually want to take -- integrate some of our products and services, whether it be Norton or some of our small business services, into their web service offerings to their small businesses or consumers.", "We used to have 3 different organizations, all calling on these big customers, and it made them crazy. So we're not going to do that anymore. We're going to have somebody that owns named Telcos, and the customers are pretty excited that we're going to make this change and focus on them. We'll cover the sell-to, the sell-with. And I think will develop much deeper and stronger relationships with those kinds of customers. Call it Telcos, ISPs, XaS -- or XaaS. Call that, an example, Amazon S3. There are a lot of new hosting companies, as the world moves to the Cloud or hybrid Clouds, that we need to figure out a way to get our technology integrated into their stack so that they can provide a better, secure environment for their customers. So we're going to have a specific focus. So almost like an OEM sale to get our technology, we -- which we think is best in breed, integrated into their offerings. And we're going to invest leadership and focus resource to make that happen. That's the concept on verticals.", "And at the top of the pyramid, enterprise and the verticals -- named verticals, named accounts in these vertical industries. We're going to have Symantec resources calling directly on these customers with partners involved on a customer-led basis.", "On commercial, we're basically going to have self-contained teams focused on the channel, dedicated to the channel, self-contained, working with our partners to grow their business and grow our business in collaboration with a philosophy that says, \"We're going to work together to win in the marketplace, and we'll split the economics in some way that's fair.\"", "We're also at the bottom of the pyramid, going to make some real progress on consumer and small business, call it SOHO [ph] business. We're going to, I believe, come up with more web services for small businesses and sell them through our e-commerce engine, which is, if you understood how we worked in the past and I'll talk about, I think we had a Norton transactional e-commerce engine. And small businesses couldn't buy from us through any kind of e-commerce capability. And I think that's one of the root causes why we've not performed well over the last few years in small business. I'm going to talk about what we're doing to change that.", "And we have some of our Geo leaders here today. What I wanted to say is we're not going to use a one-size-fits-all. This is our standard theory, that case is going to be applied in a thoughtful manner in every country. So it was very haphazard and decentralized in the past, where, frankly, it was the Wild, Wild West and everybody did their own thing. And that's part of the reason I say our system did not produce. Our marketing sales system was high cost and did not produce high-quality outcomes.", "So here's some of the specific changes that we're going to make. First, I think you've learned we're going to move from individual point solutions to have great point solutions plus more integrated offerings that solve higher-level customer problems. It's an and, not an or. And we're going to move from short-term bookings, making the current quarter's financial results, which we all want to do, to life-time customer value and make decisions that are going to lead us to more of a longer cycle. But as Jack Welch always said, \"Anybody can manage short or long. If you want to be successful at GE, you have to deliver both.\" And that's what we're going to do.", "So here's some of the specific things that you've been talking about for a while. First, new business growth. Over time, not tomorrow, especially for any of our salespeople that are listening, we're going to focus our sales force on new business only. We're going to create a renewals team. We don't -- we haven't -- we have the concept. We have a leader. We're going to figure out how to do this in a thoughtful way over time and make a smart transition from the way we've always done it to the future. I'm quite excited about this, because our renewals performance is below industry norms and our costs are way above industry norms. So we're going to get better outcomes more cost effectively and do a better job for our customers by implementing both of these challenges. And we're going to turn our sales force into hunters versus farmers.", "We're also going to make much more use of high-volume, high-quality, lower-cost sales channels, telesales, e-business. In the past, we had a wonderful -- and I give Janice credit for this; she led this process -- e-commerce transactional website for Norton. So it's logical that somebody would say, \"Well, why don't you use that for the whole company?\" Well, that's what we're going to do. And it's logical that you would say, \"Well, customers come to a website to do more these days than buy. They come to get support, and they come to do research. They come to do other things.\" So we need to broaden the scope of our e-commerce capability or e-business capability and also take that platform capability built by Janice and the consumer team across the whole company. And that's what we're going to do.", "We've added a new sales global process enablement function, which we never had before. Hard to believe, but we didn't ever have anybody whose job was to enable our sales force across the world to be productive with the tools and capabilities that are going to help them sell more, acquire more new business and be much more productive as we go forward.", "We're going to build out marketing. We -- I would say that we have some great marketing talent. But there's a lot of gaps, because we've been so sales driven. We want to be still strong in sales, but we also want to add resources to help us be more strategic and take on some of the opportunities to be more thoughtful in how we go to market. And we're going to redesign our partner program, so that we provide more value to partners that provide value to end customers. So a lot of action here, things that I've heard from some or many of you in the marketplace. These are things that we're going to do in a thoughtful fashion over the next period. And we don't want to -- we got to change the tires while the car is running.", "So now, a couple of thoughts. We've alluded to this. So I won't take a lot of time on this. But I talked about -- earlier when I took this job, we weren't going to stand still, while we were making this -- while we're building strategy for Symantec. We've made a lot of strategy-independent moves, some of which we've announced over time. Here's just a level of some of them. You can read through this slide. I don't need to share that. What's new today is now that we have a strategy, we can organize the company around the new strategy and match the talent to the new structure: strategy, structure, talent. That's the way we think about it, and that's the approach we took.", "One other thought I would say, I skipped through that, you saw today and I'm 100% supportive of this, that we split the Chairman and the CEO role at Symantec. I'm 100% believer in that. I lived in that environment before at Intuit. I think they are different jobs. They should be different jobs, and we're fortunate to have somebody as strong as Dan Schulman that's willing to step up and be the Chairman of Symantec. One thing that I didn't say today that I would tell investors, that I think is material, I'm also, as many of you know, the presiding Director of QUALCOMM. I'm not standing for reelection. My last board meeting will be in March. I love QUALCOMM. And what Paul is doing there is remarkable. But I'm stepping down from that board so I can focus all my energy on Symantec.", "In terms of the new organization design objectives, before I get into -- you can see kind of the concept as we put the structure together. This is a very interdependent organization and for the degree of change we have to go through, we need a team, starting at the top, that's very collaborative, whose skills are complementary and work together.", "So that's why we created the office of the CEO, and we're going to make a lot of decisions based on ability to collaborate. And the people that work here are going to be team players. We're going to increase our customer focus but not with our traditional structure. We're going to skate to where the puck is going, not to where it used to be, with the worlds merging between small business and consumers. I find Francis' story about -- so interesting on how the world\u2019s are merging. What we want to do is organize around the company around solving important customer problems and to get the kind of progress we need to make. Based on the redundancies and the lack of process focus and accountability and execution, it was my judgment the best way to get there with the least amount of risk was to functionalize the company. And that's what we've done. Francis is on products and services, technology; Steve and I, ham-and-egg kind of a marketing and sales; and the sales leaders still work for me, which we'll get into. But we have a focus on creating the offering and acquiring customers and expanding the relationship. And I think ultimately, this focus plus our investments in things that drive growth are going to serve us well as we go through a pretty significant transition from the way we were to the way we're going to be. And that's something that I'm very conscious of in terms of minimizing the execution risk.", "So we talked about the office of the CEO, and my peers on the stage that are part of that. I'm going to have 11 direct reports. And you can see, I highlighted in green, kind of major changes or major new roles. While Francis has been here doing the enterprise with the decision to functionalize and Janice's decision to leave, we now -- he has full scope, which I think will help us really leverage the side or the capability of the company to help us to be even better on organic growth and product development technology.", "If you take a click down one layer, this is what Francis' organization looks like. We're going to organize around end points. We put one of our best and brightest, Fran Rosch is over here. And [indiscernible] over to the right, is going to run our mobile business, one of our best and brightest engineer product management leaders. He's a superstar in the company.", "We also are going to put together -- you'll start to see the power of what Francis talked about. Norton and SEP are going to be led by the same engineering leader, Jens Meggers, who was the Norton engineering leader, one of our best engineering leaders in the company. He's now going to have a much bigger domain, so that we cannot have 2 separate everythings and start to get some synergy in our development and free up resources to redeploy to invest in things that are going to drive organic growth.", "And then Norton and SEP Product Management, Dave Cole is going to take that over. So we're going to have that hybrid. And Information Security, Anil is going to run that; and CJ is going to run Information Management. So all of those things organized around the 3 different higher-order customer groups that Francis talked about.", "Stephen's got a lot of green on his slide, which talks about how much work and why we need such an experienced and talented person. And we're so fortunate to get him to come and help us. But look at the work he has to do. #1, Allad [ph], who runs Consumer Sales, is going to work for Stephen. So Stephen is going to have Marketing and Consumer Sales, and I think his innovation and understanding of the market will really help us accelerate innovation. Plus, by eliminating some of these redundancies, we're going to find enough money to give some to investors and to invest some in solving important customers needs. And I think we can accelerate some of our innovation on the Consumer side.", "We talked about the new Renewals organization. We talked about expanding the e-commerce scope. We have to build this Cloud Ops. I don't know about -- you caught the subtlety. James will talk about this a little bit but 23 or 24 different web service platforms, that probably doesn't seem like the right way to run a company in the current environment. So we have to consolidate that over time. We're going to hire a CMO. We've added the sales process and enablement role already. And so you get a sense for the amount of transition we have to go through as a company, and it's a lot.", "So with that, I'm going to turn it over to James to tell you how we're going to both fund this and some of the numbers. And I'll come back after that to close us up.", "James A. Beer", "Thank you, Steve. I'll clip along through this session just to make sure we've got time for your questions. But we'll need to spend a moment on where we're going to be looking to invest to drive the organic growth that we plan for here. I look at it both from sources, users perspective, how we're actually going to be able to pay for the investments, how we are going to be able to drive margins up as well. So when you look at the opportunity side of the equation, I say there are 3 key drivers here. We've grown obviously through acquisition, down through the years. And we've only partially integrated many of those acquisitions. And so that fact, combined with the traditional business unit organizational structure that we have had, has really created a lot of silos. And with that comes a lot of redundancy. Add a lot of management and what we've got is a situation with significant duplication of activity, of structures, of applications, as well as the complexity that is, frankly, getting in the way of building the products and selling the products.", "More specifically, in the area that Francis will be running, so the product development and support area he alluded to is a large pool of spending now, around $1.8 billion per year. And with that overall look, we believe in combination with a zero-based budgeting approach, we'll be able to make good on the areas of duplication that we have today. We've just got a couple of examples up here, Steve mentioning the rather large number of Cloud services platforms that we have, 54 data center locations.", "There are other opportunities besides. Francis talked about his Centers of Excellence that he's going to be putting into place. That's another way in which we'll be able to cut through duplicative activity that's in place today. And then while we'll obviously be focusing on building out the 10 new product offerings that Francis spoke of, we'll look to realign the R&D and support effort going into our current point product set, realign that activity with the specific market opportunities that each of those point products have today.", "In the sales and marketing area, we think that we can make a massive change here in terms of simplifying our pricing and licensing activity. 31 price lists, 41 license meters are just again a couple of examples of the sort of complexity that is really making it more difficult for us to deal well with our customers and our partners. Steve mentioned the renewals focus. We're not satisfied with our renewal rate performance, and so we're very much of the view that a dedicated focused team will be able to operate in a very high-performing manner at a lower cost. We've got a variety of marketing groups that operate around similar missions in parallel business unit structures, so we have an opportunity there. We'll be able to, based on the routes-to-market structure that Steve talked about, make very significant progress on those 23 distinct sales channels that we note there. And then, I think, there are other opportunities to realign the field sales real estate footprint that we operate today and also drive out complexity that is embedded in the large number of individualized compensation plans that we operate.", "So those are the 2 big pools of spending. But right across the company, we have a situation where we have expanded over time the number of layers that we operate within the organization. We've narrowed the spans of control that managers look after. And not only has that created a relatively high-cost environment but also an environment which is conducive to rather slow decision-making. It can be, in essence, a communications barrier that we put into place here. The decision-making's carrying further away from the realities of the frontline for us. And so we're going to be addressing that very directly. We'll begin to be reducing the number of management layers that we operate from 10 to 6 to 7. And at the same time, we'll be approximately doubling the spans of control that we have from the current 4 to -- of the order of 8. We'll address this work in a thoughtful way through 3 waves of activity, and we would expect to be finished with that by June.", "So now, moving on to the uses side of the ledger, I'll just touch on this briefly because we have really covered a lot of this already. We see significant opportunities to invest in our future, really, the 3 drivers of organic growth in our view: people, products and infrastructure. Francis has spoken about the plans around the offering side of the equation, as well as the capabilities that we'll build to be able to deliver well on those offerings for our customers. And Steve has talked about the changes we'll be making in both the marketing and the sales area.", "I'll just touch on the G&A side for a moment. IT is very much a part of the organization that we view as a real strategic enabler of change of growth for our future. We'll look to in-source some of the high-value roles there in IT. At the same time, we're going to be looking to invest in our data center and network infrastructure to be able to offer a common platform versus the parallel platforms that we've taken on from the variety of acquisitions that we've entered into down through the years. We believe very much that, that will be important, as we look to deliver more service capability to our customers on a worldwide basis.", "Investments in IT applications will also support our streamlining of business processes. And that work is well under way in a variety of parts of our organization already. And very importantly, in financial-type presentations such as this one, we don't tend to talk a lot about HR. But I think it's very important, the focus that we'll be having on developing our talent going forward, an essential part of the overall equation.", "So before I hand it back to Steve, I just wanted to take a moment, really, as Francis did, to give you a few of my thoughts as to why I'm excited about this chapter that we're just entering into for Symantec. And clearly, we've heard a lot about the importance of our mission. Securing and managing the world's digital information has never been more important. And this really is a mission that has energized our people right across the organization.", "This afternoon, we're articulating a very clear strategy and operational plans. It's very much being validated by a variety of customers and partners. So plan based on organic growth rather than growth through acquisition. We're very much working as a team to address the really hard issues around reshaping the organization, streamlining it, identifying the areas for opportunity around efficiencies as well as investments. And we're very much going to invest in the places that makes sense for our customers, for our partners into the future. And importantly, we're going to be laser focused on execution from an operational perspective. When you put all of that together, I think the objectives of the financial elements of this plan, that Steve's now going to come up here and take you through, very much achievable. And we look forward to working towards that end.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I didn't mind putting this slide up so you can think about this a little bit when James was talking. Here's directionally where we see the company going in terms of resource allocation. Over the next few years, we would expect in, say, fiscal year '17 to be at the upper end of R&D as a percentage of revenue. We would expect marketing and sales to move from where we are today, which is in the 41%, down to 27%.", "So pretty significant reallocation, more efficient, more effective. We talked about how we're going to do that. I think we'll be better marketing and selling. And we'll also be much more efficient as we fix the system.", "G&A, we expect to be in the neighborhood of 5% or 6%, or 5% and 6%. At the same time, we expect to deliver a bunch of this money we're going to free up to investors.", "So let me shift gears to talk about our thinking, looking forward here. Look, we're committed to greater than 5% CAGR in the fiscal year '15 through '17 period and 30%-plus operating margins. The 5% and 30% plan, I committed to the board, and I'll commit to investors. That's what our team is focused on delivering. We've got a lot of execution to make that happen, but that's what we see happening. And frankly, that would still be share loss. So I'm not sure if I'd be happy at this. It might be -- you might view this is a big lift. So we're going to try and be better than this. But this is what we're committed to the board and what the management team is saying to investors.", "We have a goal of 30% operating margin in fiscal year '15. That's our goal. So that's 2 years. But '14, as James said, kind of like the fourth quarter, if anybody here can predict what's going to happen in the fourth quarter or in fiscal year '14 going through all this change, we want to be prudent in the way we're thinking about this. And we're thinking it'll look like kind of 0 to 2% revenue growth -- organic revenue growth. So we still think we can get growth, going operating margins by a couple of hundred basis points from some of our initiatives that will start. Because it's going to take us multiple years to go through a lot of the stuff we're talking about. We can't just flip the switch and make this transition. And our free cash flow will be affected by a $275 million severance charge that we're going to take and some incremental CapEx to fund the investments that we need to make in long-term growth.", "So I'll talk about capital allocation for just a second. Before we get into the announcements we made in the new news, we just want to talk about a strategy to set the direction that we're heading for as a company. Basically, it starts with the hurdle and discipline around the hurdle on how we invest our shareholders' cash. And we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders. We set a 15%-plus, risk-adjusted IRR. And over time, we target returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And as we drive organic growth increases, we would expect cash flows to grow in line with operating profit growth. And we think we'll get to about 50% for you, 50% to reinvest. If we can't find -- if we can't make internal investments that meet the hurdle, then we'll return more. And over time, we're announcing, for the first time, our dividend today, which I'll get to on the next slide. But over time, we would expect to return about 50% of the cash flow to you in a dividend and 50% in repurchase.", "So we announced today a 2.5% -- targeted 2.5% dividend, our board approved it Monday, and an additional $1 billion share authorization. And we'll continue opportunistic buybacks as we have in the past. Next year, we expect to continue to return in the neighborhood of $800 million, which is what we've been doing recently. But I think it's important for investors to realize we're -- but we're -- in addition to the $800 million, we're also going to put another $375 million to $425 million to work next year. We're going to invest it in, the onetime charge for severance and some additional CapEx. So in total, we're putting a lot more money back to work, reinvesting and keeping our $800 million share repurchase and dividend combination.", "So let me just close with a couple of thoughts. We have an operating theme for Symantec 4.0, which is, you heard it, better and easier. That will make the company better, and we got to be easier. It's really what we do, people and partnerships, internal and external, Francis talked about. We've been kind of -- been a lone wolf. There are a lot of people out there that I think we could partner with in a significant way to deliver real value to end customers, that would then we could split in some economical term. How we play? We talked about teamwork, collaboration and how we think. Innovation everywhere, especially on customer-driven innovation and technology-driven innovation. This is a technology company.", "Global and local. We've been a U.S. company with global distribution. We need to become a global company. That's what customers around the world have told me. And big and small. We want to be big, where leverage gives you benefit. Everyplace else, we want to be small, nimble, fast. And that's part of why we are announcing this organizational streamlining, which we will go through in more detail with our employees after we're done today.", "I think the most important thing, though, that I would say is, and James and Francis, Stephen alluded to this, kind of our mission, or how we think about what we do and it's one of the things that's really struck me coming here and talking to customers, we have a pretty important role in the world, in the global economy. And this may not be the final thing we ended up. This is -- but this how I think about it today. This company is all about coming to work every day, enabling people, businesses, both small and large, and countries, to protect and manage their digital information so they can spend their time and energy achieving their aspirations. That's what's Symantec 4.0 is all about. And we're going to do it on a global basis, and we're going to work as a team to deliver for our customers, for our employees, for our partners and for our shareholders.", "So now, the announcement's over. We've had a 6-month buildup to the announcement. Now the fun starts. Now we got to move to execution. So you have my -- I'm pleased to only have to focus on one thing. For the first 2 quarters, we had to work like crazy to build a strategy for this company that we felt would give a great return to our shareholders. Now we get to shift from wearing 2 hats, and we -- then we delivered. I'm proud of our team. We delivered 2 quarters that were better than I expected, while we were changing the tires in the car. Now we get to spend 100% of our focus, focused on executing this plan.", "So that's Symantec 4.0. Thanks for -- sorry, we took a little longer than we planned. But let me open it up now for your questions about whatever is on your mind.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Helyn Corcos", "So we have mic runners. If you guys go ahead and just raise your hands, we'll get a mic to you so everyone can hear. We also have Q&A over the phone line. And so I'm going to let Gwen [ph] give that instructions so we can also go to the phone line after a few in the room questions. Thank you.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "It's Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. I just want to focus on the go-to-market strategy, the 2 components. First, breaking off the renewals team. I definitely applaud that decision. But also, I just wanted to get your thought process on sort of a general sales force with specialist overlays versus a fully specialized sales force. Just what was the thought process as you went kind of through these 2 decisions?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. I think we were very complicated in our go-to market, both on how we define the market and all the overlays. And what I would tell you, without boring everybody well of details, is we're going to have self-contained teams focused on the strategy now of end point information and security information management. And they're going to be in North America, in the U.S. They're going to be -- we're going to have a dedicated commercial team that's self-contained, and we're going to have a dedicated enterprise team. And we're going to have leaders that run those self-contained teams. So I think part of the problem is all these layers and stacking and everything were confusing to our customers and to organization. And I think we're going to streamline and simplify all of that stuff. So I think it's a major change. I actually took it out of here, because I thought it was too hard to explain in a simple way. But we're going to radically change the whole structure of the sales force. We're going to change the incentives over time. We're going to change the structure, and we're going to focus people on new business as opposed to -- so it's a lot of moving parts over time. And as soon as we're ready to announce that -- you can imagine that salespeople are hearing this for the first time today. So we're going to be thoughtful in the transition. And that's where I'd leave it for now. Lots of work to do.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Steve, Brent Thill of UBS. On the margin structure, then those [ph] leverages going to come from the sales and marketing line, and I think you talked a little bit about this. But where do you see the biggest cost savings, to expand on Phil's question? I had a question for James, just on -- big deals in the quarter fell dramatically. Is that just deals that got pushed to Q4? Or how should we think about that just tactically?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Go ahead.", "James A. Beer", "Okay. Let me just address the second part of the question there. Yes, you're right. The big deals were down in the quarter year-over-year. But that wasn't consistent with the overall activity that we were seeing across the business. So we're quite comfortable with where bookings and billings grew to. So no, I wouldn't say that the big deal statistics were illustrative of the overall result.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think -- again, this is a hard thing to make simple. I think our system is just broken. I think our sales people spend less than 50% of their time selling. They spend a lot of time internally negotiating. They have all these different products they try to sell, and they have different terms and conditions. And they -- I just think we have to streamline and simplify and focus the whole thing, get the right incentives and separate the roles to do the renewals thing. I think we can be better at renewals more cost effectively. And over time, I think we change the mix of our sales force, and we'll have more telesales and e-commerce capability. One of the things that I didn't mention, because I was pushing the time a little bit, think about Francis' products that he announced, our products that Francis is going to build and his team are going to build. Think about a day when a customer could buy a soft -- integrated solution with 10 different software functionality capabilities, and they only need the 3. Okay, they shipped all 10. They decided they needed to add 3 more capabilities, and how do they do that? Oh, they turn it on in the software. That's the best cross and upsell thing that we could ever do, shipping integrated suites that you could unlock, like we've been doing in Norton, like we did in QuickBooks. And customers like that. You could -- think about your cross and upsell, what would your cost be for cross-sell and upsell if that was the offering that was compelling where you could just unlock it? So I think there's some big fundamental change in our system, in how we do our offerings, in how we simplify things, that we could take our talented field resources and focus them and just produce much more -- much better outcomes, much more cost effectively. I'm actually very comfortable in the numbers, based on what I've learned that we could -- the 41 to 27. It will be happening over time, and we're not going to try and do it all in 1 month. Yes?", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Steve, it's Adam from Morgan Stanley. I had -- actually, I've 2 questions. One, in the quarter, your storage and server management business had a real acceleration. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what happened there and what the outlook is going forward? And then I have a question on the longer-term model.", "James A. Beer", "Well, 2 stories really there. First of all, the greater absolute growth coming from the NetBackup business. We've talked about our appliances business for several quarters now, and we're pleased with the traction that, that continues to garner in the marketplace. And then secondarily, the storage management business growing for the second quarter in a row. That was important as well. So you put those 2 things together, and you arrive at the storage and server management growth rate that you saw.", "Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up on the longer-term model, you just mentioned you've got comfort with that sales and marketing number getting down to 25%. It kind of looks -- it looks like, if my math is right, you're calling for high-30s margins by fiscal '17, which would actually be an acceleration of margins after fiscal '15, is that an -- I mean, that's quite a bit of expansion from current levels. Is that an aspirational goal? Or is that kind of your base case? And maybe walk us through how you think about that.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I did -- I -- it's 27% versus 25%. Don't give me 2 extra points of -- I don't know where you're -- James, can you help me on that one because -- look, at the end of the day, I'm not that far out on the model on kind of what the margin could be. I think we said our goal is 30% in 2 years, in fiscal -- I think if we can continue to get momentum on organic growth -- and I am thrilled with the new thinking on the offering, solving higher-level jobs and being more efficient and taking those to market. If we can accelerate market organic growth more than the 5%, we said greater than 5% CAGR, we'll get volume leverage. We'll get volume. And we won't find enough 15% IRR investments that we can execute on. So we'll create more cash that we'll end up returning. So I haven't thought about an upper limit on that. I'm really focused on organic growth. And in the past, I found that if you delivered that, everything else worked out great. So let's stay focused on making the 30% in '15, and then we'll invest wisely to see the balance between reinvestment and returning to shareholders.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Walter Pritchard from Citi here. James, just 2 quick financial questions. I think where Adam was going is, is if you throw an 85% gross margin into the fiscal '17 numbers, you get the -- you get 37% margin. So maybe just a question on where do you see gross margins trending. And then, Steve, for you, just on organizational structure. I think, just having covered Symantec for a long time, the Consumer business has been probably the most consistently performing business over the last decade. And part of that's been it's had vertically everything it needed to operate. And I'm just wondering how you thought about the structure you laid out here versus maybe doing something that was consumer SMB and enterprise and following the model that had been successful there.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, a couple of thoughts. Let me actually take both of those. I think that as the world changes and mixes, customers are buying software now more on appliances. And so the margin profile may change over time from straight license. So I think you got to be careful to project kind of the mix today based on how people. And the SaaS margins may be -- so I think the dynamic, as Francis talked about how people want to buy in the next 3, 4, 5 years, is going to change a lot so -- from where we are today. That's my view. And so I'm going to be careful to kind of model based on the as is versus the to be. I think that's an important kind of thing. We're wrestling with what is it going to be. But we shift -- see it shifting away. What was your question for me, now that I answered James', again?", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "[indiscernible]", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. At the risk of being a little bit controversial, I think that relative to enterprise, our Consumer business was well run. But the margins in TurboTax are a hell of a lot better than the margins are for Norton. And so it just depends on how you define success. And I think we can do way better in Consumer. I think the new structure -- we can do a better job in consumer. I think Janice was and the team have performed well. But they were constrained by short-term financial metrics. And I'm going to free up money by making hard decisions to invest. I think we can grow Consumer by solving new problems faster. I don't think she was ever able to do that because the structure got in the -- I don't think it was a structure -- I think it's about how we run the company to maximize how we invest our resources to deliver value for customers. And I think to get to where we need to and execute effectively and minimize risk, we had to functionalize the company. I think we'll have the teamwork and the collaboration that it takes to keep the focus on small businesses and consumers. But that's part of why the whole structure is built around collaboration and teamwork. And time will tell if that was the right call. But I'm pretty comfortable we'll be able to make that work and be better. See, I think this will be better for consumers because the other changes we're making, even though in theory, if you have a self-contained team, it sounds like you'd be better. We'll see.", "Helyn Corcos", "Steve, let's go to the line, please, and take a couple of calls there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My question is for Francis. Francis, we've actually heard Symantec talked about integrating products for a few years now, and you've been a big part of that. And to Steve's point earlier, I believe customers are generally pleased with what you've done. So I guess, my question is, what are you going to do incrementally here that you haven't really done to come up with these integrated solutions? Is it more about packaging? Or is there something else going on here?", "Francis A. de Souza", "Sure, sure. So the difference is, I think, historically, what we've done is taken 1-to-1 integrations. So for example, we took the file system and we integrated it with DLP. And that was sort of a one product integrating with another. We're taking a pretty different approach here, starting with the big customer job that we're trying to solve and then looking at what would it take to solve that problem. And if you look at the 10 offerings that we're looking at, you'll see that each offering is truly a combination of at least half a dozen capabilities that we offer. And so the scale of what we're doing is, frankly, quite different from anything that we've undertaken before. Does that make sense?", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. So it's more comprehensive solutions. Is that correct?", "Francis A. de Souza", "That's exactly right, addressing a higher level of need that the customer has.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Our customers have been -- John, our -- my view on this, and I met with a bunch of customers that all said the same thing, is that they are forced to spend tens, depending on their size, millions and millions of dollars doing the integration. They get no scale and leverage from doing that. Over time, we should be able to do that for them, and we're in position to be able to do that. But it is much broader and deeper. And that's why we have to stay and make our existing offerings better and better and more competitive. And then we have to integrate them in ways that deliver more value for customers. And so over time, that's the theory of the case. And the good news is we'll have some of these come to the market the next 6 months, and some will take a little bit longer. And there's going to be a lot of heavy lifting to make that work. But I think we'll have -- I think we have a big opportunity if we can get it right. And we don't have to get all 10 of them right. So we don't have to get all 10 of them right. They don't have to be -- we just have to make progress here. Yes? If we get all 10 of them right, John, we'll be a lot faster than 5% growth, trust me.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. If I could, just a quick follow-up for James. James, you said you're going to return 50% of free cash flow to investors, and Steve mentioned that several times. Can you remind us how much of your current cash generation is generated domestically? You told us how much of your current cash is domestic. But I know I'm going to get -- we're all going to get -- does that -- does it -- can you do that? And that's what I'm just trying to work out here. How much of your generation is domestic?", "James A. Beer", "Yes. I'll just say that, obviously, the preponderance of our expenses tend to be in the U.S. And so the proportion of the overall free cash flow that we generate is going to be lesser onshore than it is offshore. And you've seen that as the offshore balances continue to rise very steadily over recent years.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Give us a general range of how much is onshore.", "James A. Beer", "Well, you've got something in the neighborhood of around 1/3 of the overall equation. But obviously, that's going to vary as time goes by, as the balance of the business changes, both on the revenue side of the equation and on the spending side.", "Helyn Corcos", "Can we have one more question in the room, please?", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I had a question -- Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies. I had a question on the product front. You talked about a lot of innovation right now, having that startups and presumably, it's a road you don't want to go down and having to acquire these. If we talk to customers, sometimes the perception is that Symantec is not sort of leading as an innovator. So 1, how do you change that perception? And then 2, if we look at the product roadmap which you talked about, it seems like that first step is a lot of integration of existing products. So maybe that doesn't fall in that innovation bucket. So again, how do you sort of communicate that with product to investors to lead that innovation wave?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. I think innovation -- I define the innovation differently. I think we can integrate existing capabilities to solve higher-order customer problems. I think that's innovation. I think it's doing new things or solving existing problems in new ways. So I think a lot of what Francis talked about is solving big customer problems in new ways. To me, that's less of a leap of faith than starting brand-new things. So we'll see. But I think the focus is not on innovation. It's on solving customers' most important problems that we are in position to solve better than anybody else, based on our assets and combining these capabilities. And so I think we've thought big about this, and we thought hard. We've tested. We met with over 50 different customers in the process. And frankly, the feedback we got is, \"If you could do this, if you can execute on what you're saying, we think that would be outstanding.\" So it comes down to focus, functional execution on technology and product development, streamlining the go-to market. But at the end of the day, if we have more compelling offerings that are must-have for customers because they solve that problem better than anybody else, our sales and marketing -- we'll get much more efficiency because the products will help us a lot. So we'll see. That's the best thought we have. And we may do some more R&D. Francis talked about advanced technology. So I think we'll do some of both. But in the next window we're talking about, it's going to be taking what we have, creating some new stuff, working it together. Longer term, we'll see how it evolves. Anybody else?", "Helyn Corcos", "One last question.", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Steve, Kash Rangan at Merrill Lynch. I had a question. You've spent the last 6 months working through the plans. I guess you've gone public today. And I guess the harder part of implementing it is communicating with the employees. And how are you going to be managing through what could be short-term disruption? And second for you, James, if I could, by my rough math, maybe I'm off. But I get about 15% upper revenue growth between now and fiscal '17, and that would mean that you have to cut sales and marketing by maybe 1/3, 30%, 35%. It seems like a pretty tight combination there. Just wondering what your thoughts are behind those assumptions.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Do you want to go first? Go ahead.", "James A. Beer", "Well, I mean I wouldn't try to foot the numbers for you precisely. But I mean, as we've discussed this afternoon, I mean, we feel as though we have plenty of opportunity to rethink the way both the sales and the marketing side of our business operate, the system, if you will, that Steve has referred to a couple of times. And so if we execute as we will on the organic revenue growth, that will be the engine for us to be able to drive to those types of expense-to-revenue ratios, while at the same time, we take the right moves to address structural change about both sales and marketing, structural changes that we've talked about in forums like this for some years now. And so I think it's the right time to step up and make these moves. We will -- we have to do it, obviously, very carefully, with very much our customers in the forefront of our minds. But we're very focused -- we -- again, as I said, at the end of my remarks, very focused on how we execute on all of these operational changes. And it's going to drive value for the organization overall. So yes, there are some important goals. They're not straightforward goals, but we very much have a plan to do it.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think the other question is a really thoughtful one about -- and part of the reason I went to every facility in the world with over 400 employees is to talk directly with our frontline employees. And that's where I spent most of the time. In the past, what we were doing, and I mentioned is, is we continued -- when we had reductions -- we did peanut butter reductions, and we eliminated frontline employees, which has left us with a management structure as a company, James shared the data, average spans of 4. I've never seen anything like that in the history of my career. And so there's all sorts of implications to that. But that's why we're taking on this organizational simplification. So I think we're going to have a rigorous process. We're going to go through it in detail with our employees in 0.5 hour. It's going to be hard. It's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done. But we have to do it. We have to do it because the business consequences for our employees, for our customers and our investors are bad if not taking this on. And so rather than having continual death by a thousand cuts, let's just do it right. Let's do it strategically. Let's take our medicine, get through it quickly and with dignity, treat people fair, which we're going to do -- be more than fair. And from this, let's not think about just the pain side, the gain side, how we can make faster decisions. We can promote our best and brightest in the bigger jobs. If you look at what's happened with the staff, we've had a lot of new people that I took -- Fran Rosch is going to run mobile. It's a big new job for him. And most of the people on my staff have bigger, new jobs. So we're going to have bigger, better jobs for fewer people. And I think that's the positive for our best and brightest. But we're going to have a simplified and streamlined structure. And we're going to have to transition to get there. But we'll be way ahead of where we are today after we go through it. Okay, that's it? That's what that means? I thought that meant circle the wagons. Well, thanks for joining us either live or on the web. This is a plan that we're quite confident in but has some execution risk. But we didn't go in -- all-in on the numbers we shared with you. That would not be a prudent thing to do. If we can execute, and we're going to focus hard on execution, this will just be the start of transitioning this company to make it a very, very exciting and much more relevant company in 5 or 10 years from now.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. With me today are Steve Bennett, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "In a moment, I will turn the call over to Steve. He will discuss our execution during the quarter and fiscal year as well as provide some thoughts on fiscal '14. Then James will provide highlights of our financial results as well as outline our guidance assumptions. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental information are posted on the website. A copy of today's prepared remarks, including guidance, will be available on the Investor Relations website after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks unless otherwise stated. Earnings per share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis. We use our foreign currency rules of thumb in our guidance section for the constant currency year-over-year growth rates.", "For the March quarter, the actual weighted average exchange was $1.32 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.28 per euro, compared to our guided rate of $1.32 per euro. For the March 2012 quarter, the actual weighted result was $1.31 per euro and the end-of-period rate was $1.33.

Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and on our website. And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I continue to be amazed by the great work done by our talented, engaged employees. Our people are focused on execution, and they're delivering. They are also excited about the Symantec 4.0 strategy and mission to protect and manage information so everyone is free to focus on achieving their goals.", "We delivered better-than-expected results for the quarter and year. Fiscal year '13 results were driven by our strong point solutions such as NetBackup, DLP and other information security offerings, as well as continued growth in our Norton and SEP endpoint products. We grew 3% organically, the largest organic growth rate in 5 years.", "FY '13 also was the start of the transformation of Symantec. The only significant things that changed during the year were some executive transitions and the January announcement of our new strategy, an organizational simplification initiative.", "FY '14 will be different. Many critical things will be changing like completing the streamlining of our management structure, reallocating significant amounts of our development resources to focus on our most promising point solutions, exciting new integrated offerings and some exciting new partnerships we haven't announced yet but expect to in the next 90 days.", "We're also changing our go-to-market strategy in many of the elements, like the creation of a new renewals team, focusing our sales organization on new business only, changing our sales compensation program, converting our generalist sales force to one that's specialized and focused on either Information Management or information security, introducing a new channel strategy and set of partner programs and building a high-powered marketing organization, to mention a few of the most critical.", "I'm certain that these will lead to significantly improved longer-term performance for Symantec. But in fiscal year '14, there's a bit more uncertainty than normal in our plan than there was in fiscal year '13. We are factoring this into our guidance as best we can.", "Let's talk in more detail about some of the changes. We're in the middle of rightsizing our management structure. We have made significant progress and are expected to have the final structure completed and in place in July. We are reducing the number of layers and increasing spans of control for our managers to industry standard levels in an attempt to increase the speed of decision-making and to improve accountability and execution.", "We expect to eliminate between 30% and 40% of our management positions. We will have fewer, bigger jobs for our best and brightest. We are also attracting world-class talent from the outside, some of the most recognized tech companies in the world. Over the next few months, you'll hear more about some great senior-level talent coming to join and strengthen the Symantec leadership team.", "As the threat landscape evolves and the consumer and enterprise worlds continue to converge, we see real value in merging our Norton and SEP solutions to solve new customer problems and reduce redundant expenses. Moving from protecting the endpoint to protecting people and their information in a device-independent way will help us transform this business. Especially when you think about all the new control points that will be added as we move into the -- enter the era of the Internet of Things with connected devices touching nearly every aspect of our lives.", "Our Norton business has a large and loyal customer base, and this gives us great foundation to build on as we reinvent this important business. In the short term, we expect the Norton business to deliver flattish revenue growth given market dynamics, including PC unit declines. As mentioned in January, our FY '15 to '17 planning assumption is for this market to be relatively flat over that time horizon. Despite what we are focused -- despite that, we are focused on innovation to define new market opportunities that grow the category. One example is leveraging the powerful Norton brand to help us better reach small businesses.", "Given how this market has evolved, we are taking a rigorous look at every partnership deal. We will not sign any new agreements that don't make financial sense. Moving away from any OEM distribution partnership would put some pressure on our new customer acquisition in the short term but would be materially accretive to the bottom line. With respect FY '14 financials, we remain committed to delivering 0 to 2% revenue growth and a 200 basis point improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in constant currency for the year.", "Let me take a second to highlight 2 other things we feel good about. We are still guiding a 200 basis point improvement even though we delivered 60 basis points above expectations on a currency-adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of FY '13. James will provide more details, but let me highlight that margin improvements are not balance throughout the year. They are more back-end loaded as the benefits from organizational simplification don\u2019t really begin until the September quarter.", "Second, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. With the stock price increase since January, we are maintaining our 2.5% dividend and raising the quarterly amount from $0.13 to $0.15 per share. This amounts to an additional $70 million on an annual basis. We will also maintain the share repurchase activity levels we talked about in January. So in effect, we are now planning to return more cash to shareholders than we announced in January. James will provide more details in a few minutes.", "In summary, we're happy with the fiscal year '13 performance. In fiscal year '14, we will make significant progress transforming Symantec and building a solid foundation for future profitable growth. We will work hard to deliver solid results in FY '14 while making these important and material changes.", "We are gaining momentum, and customers, partners and employees have responded well to our strategy. Our markets continue to grow, and we have some exciting new offerings, partnerships and go-to-market changes that will accelerate revenue growth in FY '15 and beyond. As stated in January, we remain committed to delivering compounded annual organic revenue growth above 5% with greater than 30% margins in the FY '15 to '17 timeframe.", "Let me close by saying that after 9 months, I've never been more excited about our prospects and opportunities, and confident about our ability to transform this company in a very positive way to deliver a much higher level for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. We are making solid progress every day and getting better on many fronts.", "Thanks for all of your support and with that, I'll turn the call over to James.", "James A. Beer", "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon. I'd like to start with a summary of our financial results for the March quarter and then review our performance during fiscal year 2013.", "We posted better-than-expected March quarter results, including record revenue and deferred revenue that were driven by double-digit growth in our backup business and continued strength in Data Loss Prevention and our other information security products. Fourth quarter GAAP revenue grew 5% in constant currency to $1.75 billion. This result drove our organic constant currency revenue growth to 4% for the March quarter year-over-year. Our better-than-expected revenue results, coupled with lower spending across the company, expanded our non-GAAP operating margin by 140 basis points year-over-year to 23.9%. Consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our subscription and appliance businesses, non-GAAP gross margins declined 90 basis points year-over-year.", "Non-GAAP net income of $314 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44. Improved operating leverage from stronger-than-expected revenue performance positively impacted EPS by $0.04. In addition, lower OEM fees and other spending controls each accounted for approximately $0.01 of benefit to EPS. As expected, we received an R&D tax credit benefit, while other one-time tax benefits positively impacted EPS by approximately $0.01.", "CSEs of 714 million were higher than expected as the increase in our stock price drove greater option exercises and dilution from our convertible notes of approximately 12 million shares. This negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $612 million, down year-over-year due to payroll timing and higher spending on product development and restructuring.", "Now moving onto the full year results for fiscal 2013. We generated record revenue and deferred revenue, expanded non-GAAP operating margins by 60 basis points and delivered double-digit EPS growth driven by our backup and information security businesses. NetBackup, which is the largest product in our portfolio, was one of our fastest-growing businesses in fiscal 2013 driven by strong demand for our backup appliances. Overall, we drove organic constant currency revenue growth of 3%.", "In FY '13, 87% of total revenue was ratable, and we continue to provide increased revenue predictability as much of the growth in our product portfolio is subscription-based. In aggregate, content, maintenance and subscription revenue grew 5%, while license revenue was flat year-over-year. Subscription revenue, which includes our consumer, authentication, Managed Security Services and SaaS offerings, grew 6% and accounted for 44% of total revenue compared to 43% of revenue in fiscal 2012. Excluding the Consumer business, our enterprise subscriptions grew 12% and accounted for 14% of total revenue as compared to 12% in the prior year.", "Turning now to our business segments. In fiscal year '13, the Storage and Server Management segment, which consist of our backup, archiving and Storage and Availability Management businesses, grew 5% and generated revenue of $2.48 billion. Specifically, revenue from our backup and archiving business grew 9% year-over-year and 6% organically driven by NetBackup.", "Revenue in our Storage and Availability Management business decreased 4% year-over-year as headwinds continue from the decline in our customer's use of the Solaris platform. The Security and Compliance segment grew 7% year-over-year and generated revenue of $2.05 billion. Organically, Security and Compliance grew 3% driven by our continued leadership in Endpoint Protection and double-digit growth in our information security business.", "The Consumer business grew 2% year-over-year to $2.11 billion driven by upselling customers to our premium suites and growing our emerging backup NortonLive Services and Mobile businesses. Our Services business grew 7% year-over-year to $265 million driven by double-digit growth in Business Critical Services as demand for high-touch infrastructure protection services continues to grow.", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 100 basis points year-over-year driven by growth in our backup appliances and subscription businesses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.7%, up 60 basis points from the year-ago period driven by our revenue growth and lower OEM fees.", "We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations, down 16% year-over-year as reported driven by reduced collections due to weak billings at the end of the March 2012 quarter, higher cost of goods sold, restructuring costs and cash tax payments. Our total cash balance of $4.7 billion includes the $1 billion in net proceeds from our debt offering in June 2012 that will be used to retire our $1 billion convertible notes maturing next month on June 15. Excluding this $1 billion, approximately 31% of our cash balance resides in the U.S. During the fiscal year, we spent $826 million to repurchase 49 million shares at an average share price of $16.98, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 7% or a net 3.7% after adjusting for stock compensation.", "Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance. Starting in fiscal 2014, we will be providing annual guidance as well as quarterly guidance. We are replacing quarterly deferred revenue guidance with operating margin guidance and adding EPS guidance for the year. This change will allow investors to better track our progress against our key financial measures.", "For fiscal year '14, we remain committed to our revenue guidance of 0 to 2% growth and non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 200 basis points, both on a constant-currency basis. We are maintaining our operating margin target even though in fiscal year '13, on a constant-currency basis, we delivered 60 basis points more than expected. We expect non-GAAP EPS to grow between 5% and 7% in fiscal year '14.", "For the June 2013 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion compared to $1.67 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue is expected to be lower year-over-year for 2 reasons. First, the weak yen is driving a projected foreign currency headwind of $15 million; and second, our typical Q1 sequential revenue performance has been down about 2.5% versus the 1.7% reduction implied by consensus estimates. This difference equates to another $15 million.", "We expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 8.6% to 8.7% compared to 16.1% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 22.6% to 22.7% compared to 26.1% last year.", "GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.11 and $0.12 as compared to $0.24 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share are estimated to be between $0.35 and $0.36 as compared to $0.43 in the year-ago period. EPS is expected to be lower year-over-year driven by the revenue items I just noted and higher spend year-over-year, each accounting for $0.03 of impact to EPS.", "Also, starting in the June quarter, we expect to implement a new commissions accounting methodology, which would decrease EPS by $0.01 in the quarter. This methodology more evenly distributes the impact of commission expenses across our quarters while more closely aligning our expenses to the timing of the associated recognized revenue.", "As part of our capital allocation strategy announced in January, we will distribute our first ever quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, equivalent to a yield of approximately 2.5% based on the closing stock price of $24.35 on May 1, 2013. This is a significantly higher dividend payment than what we assumed in January given our recent stock price appreciation. Payment will occur on June 27 to shareholders of record on June 19.", "In addition to paying dividends, we will continue to buy back our shares. Based on our recent stock performance, more of our outstanding options are in the money, and we are seeing an increased rate of employees exercising options. We plan to use the proceeds from exercised options to add to the previously projected total capital return of $800 million for FY '14. Depending on actual option exercise volumes, this could add between $100 million and $150 million to our total capital return to shareholders in fiscal year '14.", "Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.31 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.28 and the end-of-period rate of $1.27 per euro in the June of 2012 quarter. Our guidance for both the quarter and the full year assumes an effective tax rate of 28%. We expect common stock equivalents for the quarter of approximately 710 million shares, and expect our share count to remain flat for the full year.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While Gwen is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on our upcoming conference events. We will be presenting at the JPMorgan Investor Conference on May 15 in Boston, and we'll be reporting our fiscal first quarter results on July 30. For a complete schedule of our investor-related events, please visit the Events section of the Investor Relations website.", "Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "And we'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'm wondering, James, if you could talk about you not guiding to deferred revenue growth. Could you talk about just how we should expect that to track versus revenue? Should it follow historic patterns? And then any comments on cash flow for fiscal '14 would be helpful as well.", "James A. Beer", "So in terms of deferred revenue, I would expect it to approximately track revenue. What we are seeing is increasing growth in the subscription businesses in the Services business, which of course start out their sales volumes as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. So I would expect directionally deferred revenues to continue tracking along with revenue. In terms of cash flow for fiscal '14, I mean, the first thought is I would expect over a longer run that cash flow would track operating profit growth. In fiscal '14, as we discussed back in January, we'll have some pretty sizable severance charges of the order $220 million to $250 million on severance coming up. And so I would expect cash flow to be down year-over-year in fiscal '14 as a result.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then Steve, can you just talk about on the sales side. I think we've become sort of may be hypersensitive at Symantec to disruptions in the sales force and impact of that. Could you give us a sense of just sort of order of magnitude how many people are changing roles and how you've accounted for that in your -- in both your maybe your Q1 as well as your annual guidance?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Walter, I think the big thing is that virtually everybody's changing roles because we're moving from full line of salespeople that were all generalists, selling all of our products and services, to having people that are specialists in Information Management or information security which has been very well received from our customers and from our partners as people have been asking us to be more specialized for a while. So that our core salespeople, it's a big change. And so -- but I would tell you, in my discussions with them, they're very fired up about the changes at Symantec and the new offerings that are coming and the progress we're making. So we have a talented and energized sales force that's going through some degree of change, and we think we're thoughtful about the impact that could have on revenue. But my view is that with all the good things happening, I think we'll get through this without too many significant bumps, at least that's what I'm hoping.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "Kenneth R. Talanian - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "This is Ken Talanian in for John. Just first, looking at your guidance for next quarter, on the revenue side, is any of that weakness focused on a specific segment of your business?", "James A. Beer", "No, I wouldn't say so. I'd just reemphasize the focus on the yen and the way that, that has weakened quite significantly in the last few months, in particular at our normal sequential variance of revenue from the March quarter to the June quarter.", "Kenneth R. Talanian - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just generally speaking, on the Consumer business, obviously, we are facing a bit of a headwind, given the PC unit market declines. As you think about that business, how much impact is the upselling to premium in the emerging products like mobile? How much is that compensating for the slowdown in your core market?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, when you look at our performance of recent times, I'd say about 1.5 points of growth are coming from the new emerging products and services such as mobile.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "But I think it's important, Ken, to say that OEM deals and PC slowdown is having less and less impact on our new -- it's a decreasing part of our new customer acquisition as we build up our direct e-commerce capability to acquire customers direct. So it used to be like that was the majority, and now it's way, way less than 50% and going down. So while the PC softness puts some pressure on us, I don't think that's going to have as much impact as people might be thinking.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Steve, if eliminating 30% to 40% of sales management is indicative of the changes you're making to the rest of the sales force, it would seem this could yield even more than the 200 basis points of margin improvement. Because if you're able to get enterprise sales and marketing spend down closer to benchmark, call it 30% of enterprise sales, that would yield more like 600 to 700 basis points of margin improvement. So are you reinvesting some of this elsewhere, or is this just happening more slowly? And to that point, to the revolution of Symantec 4.0, when can we expect the organizational changes to be largely locked down?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, I think, Brad, that we've changed over 50% of the senior leaders on the team already. So -- and we did that in the January announcement. So I would say that's a pretty significant move, and the 30% to 40% number that we talked about was in the total company. So -- and we said that will be completed in July. So we expect that to be, what I call the final 2 waves of that, and we expect that to be completed in July. So I mean, that's kind of a tough time that we're in now and -- but we'll be through it in July. The other point you bring up is, obviously, for us to redeploy a bunch of resources to fund these integrated new offerings that we talked about and these new partnerships, that money is coming from somewhere. So over time, we are spending, as we said, more money on R&D to solve our customers' most important growth and -- or most important problems so we can accelerate organic growth. So I think what you have us doing is taking money and reinvesting it. We're giving some to shareholders, and I think 200 basis points again this year on top of the performance in the fourth quarter is a pretty significant commitment. At the same time, we're investing in the things that give us confidence that we're going to grow more than 5% organically over the '15 through '17 periods. So I think we're balancing both sides of giving margin and investing in things that are going to drive long-term growth. I mean, we could give you more margin in the short term if we didn't want to invest in driving long-term growth, but we think we're at the appropriate balance between returning excess cash and margin to shareholders and investing in things that we think are going to create more longer-term value for our investors.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "That makes sense, Steve, and the balance makes sense as well. James, if I could just ask you a quick one. On the new commissions accounting methodology, can you just maybe talk to us a little bit about which quarters we should expect some of that expense to come from, so where we see the benefit on the flip side?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, what we'll be doing is, in essence, reducing what you would've previously seen in the back half of the year and increasing commensurately in the front half of the year. Now what we will do as we publish our results is go back in time, and so you'll have true apples-to-apples history given this new methodology.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Steve, just on the sales transformation. Other companies that we've all followed, when they go through a change this sizable, it tends to take 6 to 9 months to settle in. So if your plan is to be completed by July, what gives you confidence in that the second half of the recovery versus pushing in -- out a few more quarters which has historically been the norm?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So Brent, I think I'm giving you mixed message here, apples and oranges. We said that we were going to be done with the management initiative only in July. I think the transition of our sales force will proceed in a thoughtful and measured way through the year. For instance, we haven't even decided yet when we're going to flip things over to the renewals team versus the field sales force today, and so we're going to phase that among different geographies in the world. So I think the whole year, we should be thinking about a smooth transition, but our strategy on this was to tell you what was coming, tell our employees what was coming and make them part of the process as opposed to announce it on Friday and change everything on a Monday. So I think we're going to be able to because there's no surprise here, hopefully manage the transition more smoothly than some have but at the same time, it is a big transition. So I would think about -- we're not shooting for a deadline here. We're talking about trying to get it right, which is why we thought despite the recent positive momentum, that it made sense to be 0 to 2% revenue guidance for next year, which is the same thing we told you in January.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the backup business which is clearly a highlight; can you give us your sense of what you're seeing in the pipeline this year in that business? And it seems, again, to be outpacing the other business by a considerable margin. What are you seeing that's driving that?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I think the capabilities that our appliances offer our customers are quite well differentiated our ability to duplicate the reams of data -- deduplicate it, excuse me, effectively for them, closer to the source of the information being created has worked to be very popular with customers. And beyond that, I'm encouraged by the pipeline of development that we have around our appliances generally. So I think we'll have more to offer our customers in the coming months and quarters.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I think, guys, we're a little bit surprised to see headcount ending the year up in Q4 versus Q3 given all the talk about restructuring and reducing management layers and the like and then subsequently, the timing of the expense cuts through FY '14. Can you walk us through, perhaps in a little bit more detail, the timing of headcount reductions on a go-forward basis, when expenses get taken out of the model over the next couple of quarters to get to the type of margin improvement that you're looking for in FY '14?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So let me just give you a little, Keith, a little bit of philosophy and I'll turn it over to James. Look, I think that this is kind of an interesting number because we have thousands of temporary workers and contract employees that you never have any visibility into that I do. So at the end of the day, as you're trying to figure out how to model all these stuff, you're never going to have the data to model it that you'd like to have. And so one of the things we did is we invested in some areas that, like I said in December, to add resources to fix -- in the technical support area. Now we didn't add 1,000 employees. So -- but I think the material point from my point of view, and then I'll turn it over to James to give you something more thoughtful, is we're committed to 200 basis points of margin improvement for next year and people-related costs are 70% of our costs. And so we can't get there without managing our investment in resources, but it's not just the headcount numbers you see. It's temporary employees and contract employees, and there's all sorts of games that companies can play to keep employees off the books. We're just cleaning out all of that, and we're going to deliver 200% -- 200 basis points of margin improvement. And so there's a lot of moving parts here, and that's what we're focused on managing.", "James A. Beer", "Yes, the headcount drivers, Keith, specifically, more than half of it was tech support as we've discussed in previous calls that we've really been looking to focus on improving the customer experience there, and we're pleased by the progress we're making. The rest of the headcount additions were in areas of the business where we're growing very nicely, so areas like appliances. And of course, as our service businesses grow, we have to add the heads for the people who are delivering on those services.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then maybe a follow-up on some of the transaction counts. It looks like you guys saw growth in the deals over $300,000. But the multiple product number that you gave, the percentage of large transaction of multiple products fell off a little bit, both in the $300,000 and the million -- $1 million value. Was that macro-related? Was that purposeful in spreading out transactions a little bit more? Could you give some color into why those metrics stated on a year-on-year basis?", "James A. Beer", "No, I wouldn't point to anything of a strategic nature here. The metric that you're referring to is a dollar-based metric, and it just so happened that a year ago, all of the top deals included both security and storage and this year, most of them were one or the other. It's just the way the deals tended to fall. I think it's important to really focus on our organic growth rate. We got it up to 3%, best in 5 years.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to dig in a little bit about sort of just the timing and the flow in the sales force changes and just in terms of guidance. And obviously, a lot of the changes are going to be happening here in Q1. Just wondering if you're going to detail how you contemplated that in terms of the revenue guidance? Obviously, James, you talked about the currency headwind from Japan. But when you think about just the changes that are going on, how you -- kind of whether it'd be haircut the pipeline or what have you for the June quarter to make sure that it's conservative enough, given the amount of changes have been, to the question of how you kind of expect the revenue growth to reaccelerate to get to 0 to 2%. I mean, is it very much second half weighted or how do you just expect that to flow on?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, for the current quarter, we really aren't changing the traditional structure of compensation and so forth for the sales team. That all really kicks in later in the year. So I wouldn't point to any change we've made in how we think about revenue guidance related to change in comp structures. It's really just driven...", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I didn't mean comp structure. I mean, also headcount too.", "James A. Beer", "Well, similarly, we wouldn't be seeing those issues impact the sales force during Q1. So the revenue for Q1, very much driven by the yen factor that I noted and just the normal sequential move from a March quarter to a June quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I had a follow-up question on the storage business. You talked about the strength in NetBackup, and it sounds like from your Vision Event, you're going to be moving more towards capacity-based licenses over the summer. Can you talk about the potential impact there? And then secondarily, on the storage management side, is there any sort of line of sight to a trajectory there? Should we continue the same dynamics on the Solaris to Linux migration?", "James A. Beer", "In terms of the move to more capacity-based pricing around NetBackup, I wouldn't expect that to have a noticeable effect on our revenue trend line. While there would be some moving towards a more ratable approach as a result, the flip side of that is as we continue to grow the appliances business, then there's more of that revenue recognized upfront. So net-net, I wouldn't see an awful lot of variation in the overall revenue growth rate.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And on the storage management business?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I would just say that as you look at these new integrated offerings that we're talking about, a bunch of them, including some of the partnerships we're talking about, include leverage what we used to call the storage management business. So again, I just don't even think about it as a business, and I don't think you'll see us reporting revenue, James, as we go forward on the storage management business. So to me, this is technology that can solve important problems when we redeploy it and think differently about it, and we got into trouble as a company thinking about it as a standalone business. And so I think the sooner we move to how fast is -- how we're using this to help us grow and solve new customer problems, I think the faster we'll be through the transformation from 3.0 to 4.0.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I certainly appreciate the Strategy Day that you had back in January in terms of how you're aligning your cost structure, your management spend, et cetera, and certainly that boils into an attractive financial outcome. I'm also curious to get your perspective on the product in comparative side. I look at the core business, it's largely dominated by the endpoint business and also the storage business. And there are some maturity concerns in those 2 businesses. You got secular competitors, new generation of anti-malware companies and some secular competitors, such as Amazon Web Services. I'm wondering, how do you take into account the longer-term structural changes in your end markets and how you reposition your product portfolio to achieve these financial objectives?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Kash, I think it's a good question. It's a question I asked when I came in, and I toured around the world and everybody told me the same thing is that we've competed on a series of 150 different point solutions and what we've reoriented the whole company around is leveraging all our technology to solve our customers' most important problems. So what we said is, which is really important on this front, is we're going to double down on some great point solutions we have that are leaders like NetBackup that continues to perform well. We're going to solve higher-order customer problems with these new integrated offerings that we announced in January that we think changes the basis of competition from point solutions where we have to compete with all of the individual point solutions to integrated offerings where it's hard for our competitors to compete. And third, we're going to talk -- we talked about some new partnerships where we integrate what we do with what third parties do, like network security providers, to do a better job for support and [ph] customers. And so I think by definition, our whole strategy is based around changing the game to solve important customer problems. And the feedback we've gotten from basically universally from everybody you talk to, this strategy makes sense, can you execute, and that's what we're focused on doing. And from what I've seen versus the competitors that we're playing against, if we can execute against these new integrated offerings and these partnerships, I think we will deliver a lot of value for our customers that are some of our or most of our competitors would have a hard time matching.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I also wanted to follow up on the backup performance because it does stand out this year as a great performance. And I just want to try to get a sense of was the -- how much of that was product cycle in FY '13? And as you look forward, do you think those type of growth rates are sustainable? You talked about some of the stuff you're doing in appliances. That would be one. And then the follow-up would be, how should we think about the gross margin structure next year and maybe a couple of years down the road as you shift to more appliances and [ph] subscription?", "James A. Beer", "Well, in the first part of that question, the product cycle, I wouldn't say that, that had very much to do with our results at all. We -- in fact, as we've discussed in previous calls, Backup Exec has been something of a challenge, and we continue to work through and improve upon our offerings in the Windows market there. So if anything, I think there's more opportunity ahead of us in that regard, both around the Backup Exec line as well as the NetBackup appliances. Two, gross margin, because I think that appliances will continue to grow and our service subscription type offerings will continue to grow, I would expect there would be continued pressure on gross margin to some extent as we saw in this past year, for example. But that's why we're really focusing on making commitments around operating margin improvements, hence the recommitment to the 200 basis point improvement in '14 over '13 even though we delivered more in operating margin in '13 than we were expecting to back when we did our strategy announcement in January.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Greg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I had a clarification and then a question. First, for Steve, you talked about flat Norton going forward, at least in the short term. Would that hold true even if you opt not to renew most or all of your upcoming OEM agreements? And then secondly, just a follow-up for James, I do want to ask about Backup Exec this particular quarter, you just touched on some of it. What I was curious about, though, was are we getting any closer to stabilization in that particular area?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So on the first question, Greg, on renewals, I think that if -- again, the amount of new business we get new customers from Norton has declined dramatically from the OEM channel. It's still important but not nearly as important as it was. So if we chose not to renew a large deal when it came due, we would have a short-term blip that we would have to try and offset to other things like taking Norton to small business. But while we might have a short-term revenue, we'd be materially accretive to the bottom line. And so if that's the way it came down, we'd have a little short-term revenue blip and a significant positive on EPS.", "James A. Beer", "And in terms of Backup Exec, we're still experiencing challenges there impacting Backup Exec's revenue double-digits. Now I would expect that, that will improve gradually. I think the most material opportunity for us to improve with Backup Exec is around the next release that we're very much working on but won't be out for some time yet later in this fiscal year.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "And just one thought to add to James' point, look, I think it's the same team that runs both of these businesses, and we've made a lot of changes in the team that stubbed its toe in the release on Backup Exec. So it's been wholesale change, and I think it's the same team that's doing such a great job on NetBackup. So I think we're going to see real progress, but we did dig ourselves a hole and I agree with James, there's headwind there that we're actually digging our way out of in a market that's strong and growing. So I think this is a big opportunity for us. This was our execution that caused us the problem, nothing else, as witnessed by the real strength we've had on NetBackup where we didn't stub our toe.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "James Wesman", "It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. James, just looking at the business in the quarter, were there any verticals that stood out that were particularly strong or weak?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I was pleased with execution across the organization, certainly, our primary verticals, financial services, telcos, health care, so forth. I'd put the federal sector on the weaker end of the spectrum, not surprisingly given the sequestration challenges. But net-net, you look at the America's revenue growth, it was actually our faster revenue geography.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe James, just to clarify on the expense side as it relates to the commission, can you just clarify that a little bit more? Are you guys going to be capitalizing expenses here? Or just maybe a little bit more color on how expenses relate.", "James A. Beer", "No, it's, in essence, flattening out the commission expense across the 4 quarters. That's more so how you should think of it. So at different points in time, there will be one accrual or another. But the net expense result is a flattening quarter by quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets.", "James Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "This is Jim Moore actually in for Dan. Steve, since you've taken over, over the last sort of while, we've definitely seen a tougher IT spending environment just from what we've seen in the first quarter results from a lot of your tech peers. I'm just wondering if you guys have seen any changes in conversation with customers or partners, or if you could comment on the environment?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, no, I think the simple answer to your question is I think all companies are under spending pressure, but security and information management still have a unusually high focus and are standouts in terms of growth and market growth even in a difficult IT spending environment. All of the data we show for the next few years says that that's not going to change. And so we still feel quite good about the market growth opportunities, both in security and information backup or information management. And if anything, there's just more pressure. I mean, on both security and -- the amount of information continues to explode, and the security threat environment continues to become more challenging. So I see that there's a lot of forces pushing this market to grow that don't seem to look like they're going to abate in the near future.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Richard Williams with Cross Research.", "Richard T. Williams - Cross Research LLC", "Wondering if you could talk about the potential for providing cyber security for Wall Street for financial organizations. Does that represent opportunity or risk? How should we think about that?", "James A. Beer", "Well, financial services have been one of our key verticals for many years and the challenges that they're facing from a cyber-perspective are increasing just along the lines of what Steve was just saying. So we see significant opportunities for us to continue to broaden out the relationships that we have with really all of the key financial services companies in this country and indeed around the world.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Just to build on James' point, I was at a recent conference where one of the CEOs from one of the large financial institution said that they were taking up their spend on security 33% next year, and it's a big number. So I think that they are under such a serious threat environment in such a targeted vertical that they will have to continue to spend money now to protect the customer data and the assets.", "Richard T. Williams - Cross Research LLC", "Is that true as well in Japan as it relates to -- that you see in North America?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. I think in some cases, what you're finding because of all of the interest that you're reading about in the print that the market is growing faster in Asia than some other parts of the world because the threat landscape is tenuous in Asia or very challenging there, as it is in the Middle East and many other parts of the world. I think this is a global need because the attackers can play globally from wherever they are locally. This is a complete boundary-less playing field, and they're just going after multiple targets and there's lots of people who have vulnerabilities and so it's a target-rich environment for the bad guys.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I want to focus a little bit on the Security and Compliance business growing, I think, 4% year-over-year constant currency. You highlighted how the DLP component of the business was strong. Just curious about the other components, specifically desktop, given some of the struggles one of your larger competitors have in that market, why you're not seeing more growth here. Is that indicative of just where that market is in terms of legacy or something else happening?", "James A. Beer", "Well, in addition to DLP, I was really pleased with the double-digit growth that we're seeing out of areas like encryption, Managed Security Services. Our Trust Services business continues to grow very nicely for us. So as to the Endpoint Security business, that's closer to flat. And I think that represents the maturity of that portion of the business. Now that said, it's still a very important part of a corporate environment, and we see opportunities to really leverage our skills, our capabilities of the endpoint as we enter into other partnerships with different players around the industry, and we'll have more to talk to you about that in the coming weeks and months.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And then on the Storage and Server Management side, it seems like you've seen a lot of strength over the last few quarters from this mix shift to appliances. When does that start to anniversary, and could that pressure growth as we think about the back half of '14 for that category specifically?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "No. I think it's going to continue to -- look, my view is customers are increasingly preferring to buy their Software as a Service or through an appliance because it's easier as opposed to a license. So I think that we have to be focused on making it easy to buy -- for customers to buy all of our products and services in the manner they want to consume them, and I see appliances as being, in many ways, even faster growing than SaaS because it's a better way -- it's an easier way for customers to buy integrated solutions where we integrate the hardware and the software to make it easier for them to install and run. And so I -- and we have new appliances coming in the pipeline that we're quite excited about that James talked about. So we think that we have a great opportunity to continue to gain share in this big market where we've made a lot of progress in the last year, and we have new stuff coming that we're excited about.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Steve Bennett for any closing remarks.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Look, thanks for attending today. We feel great about the year we had in FY '13. We feel good about '14 with a lot of changes that we know are going to help us prepare -- lay the foundation to deliver much better performance in FY '15 through '17. So in this transition year, we're going to focus hard on executing and making the right decisions to build this foundation up so that we can be solid to accelerate things in the future. So it's a big -- it's a transition year, and you see that reflected in our thinking and hopefully in our words, but we're more excited than ever about our ability to deliver real value for our customers and continue the transformation.", "So thanks for your support, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss our First Quarter 2014 Results. With me today are Steve Bennett, Symantec's President and CEO; and James Beer, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "In a moment, I will turn the call over to Steve. He will discuss our execution during the quarter and provide some thoughts on our future. Then, James will provide highlights of our financial results, as well as outline our guidance assumptions. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Symantec's Investor Relations website. A copy of today's press release and supplemental financial information has been posted on our website. Our prepared remarks will be available also on the website after the call is completed.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that we made several financial reporting changes this quarter. These include reorganizing our business into 3 new segments, eliminating the Other segment and changing our accounting policy for commission expensing. We've included re-casted historical financials based on these changes in our supplemental doc and press release in order to provide you with comparable financials. Also, we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated. Earnings-per-share growth rates are provided on an as-reported basis only. A summary of our year-over-year constant currency and actual growth rates are included in our press release table and in our supplemental information. Some of the information discussed on this call, including our projections regarding revenue, operating results, EPS, cash flow from ops, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation for the coming quarter contained forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's most recent periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Symantec assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP results, which can be found in the press release and the supplemental doc. And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Steve Bennett.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Thanks, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by saying how proud I am of the team's execution this quarter. In a period of significant organizational change, we grew organic revenue by 3% and expanded non-GAAP operating margins to 25.3%. Over the past 12 months, the team has made significant progress transforming the company. By the end of July, we will be almost done with our organizational simplification initiative, bringing the number of management layers and spans of control closer to industry standards and reducing our management structure by 30% to 40%. In addition, we removed some redundancies across the organization during the last quarter resulting in the elimination of some individual contributor positions.", "From a strategic perspective, our better-than-expected results were driven by strength in some of our largest businesses, like Endpoint Security and Enterprise Backup. Our Endpoint Security business grew again this quarter, driven by the strength of our offerings. And our Enterprise Backup business continues its strong double-digit growth as we focus on simplifying the complexity inherent in today's backup environments. By delivering an easy-to-use integrated backup appliance that addresses customers' unmet and underserved needs, we have gained share and driven higher top line organic growth for the company.", "While we are pleased with our progress on many fronts, we have some areas where we still have some improvement opportunities, one being Backup Exec. We believe we're on the right track to resuming growth in fiscal year '15. Last week, we delivered a Backup Exec release focused on expanding platform support and improving quality. We're also optimistic about another Backup Exec release planned for the end of this fiscal year that will address migration issues and provide additional capabilities that will benefit our customers.", "From an FY '14 financial perspective, we are reiterating our revenue guidance of 0% to 2% growth with a 200-basis-point improvement in operating margins. In the near term, we're factoring uncertainty associated with implementing additional go-to-market changes into our September quarter guidance. I'll let James provide the specifics of our guidance for the September quarter.", "Over the FY '15 to FY '17 timeframe, I remain confident we will deliver an organic revenue growth CAGR above 5% with greater than 30% operating margins. There are a number of reasons I'm confident in the future of Symantec. We've continued to deliver while both running the company and at the same time significantly changing the company. We continue to attract top senior-level talent who are signing on to be part of our important mission and want to be part of helping transform the company. I've never seen such a target-rich environment with so many large unmet, underserved customer needs in markets that are already growing 8% to 10% according to IDC reports.", "We're also excited about our new offering strategy with its 3 distinct elements. First, managing our existing point solutions in a more strategic way and being much more rigorous on resource allocation based on the market opportunity for each offering. Second, we are excited about the new integrated offerings that solve higher order, higher value customer problems. This will change the basis of competition in a way that is positive for us and delivers real value for our customers. And third, we can solve even larger customer problems and deliver even more value when we integrate our capabilities with selected other firms. This will help us win in the market and expand our available market. You've heard me talk about the network security providers as an example of this large opportunity.", "So where are we on these partnerships? In simple terms, we are in advanced discussions with network security partners, including running proof of concepts with selected beta customers. We want to have tangible benefits and proof points before we announce anything related to these partnerships. My team, customers and our partners are very excited about these opportunities and how they can benefit our joint customers. Stay tuned for future announcements.", "Let me share another thought. You may have read recently about a small but important acquisition we just closed. We acquired some technology assets and hired a technical team of PasswordBank, a provider of multifactor authentication, single sign-on and user management services. As a matter of fact, I'm heading over to see them next week on a European trip. I highlight this because this is the type of acquisition you should expect from us in the future, buying engineering teams and technology, not buying revenue. Our plan is to grow organically, and these types of acquisitions will complement and accelerate our internal innovation approach.", "Another big area of focus for the team has been on our go-to-market approach. In the second quarter, we're beginning the implementation of many of the changes we talked about in January. New roles for our sales force as hunters versus farmers and changing their incentives to be paid on new business. We're also beginning implementation of the change from a general sales force to one where the vast majority of either information security or information management solutions.", "We also started the implementation of a new centrally managed renewals organization, which will be up and running by the end of the fiscal year across the world. I'm optimistic that our offerings and go-to-market changes will lead to significantly improved longer-term performance for Symantec.", "In closing, I'd like to reflect briefly on my 1-year anniversary. I've never been more optimistic about the team and our opportunities. There's been a lot of positive changes at the company so far, and we can feel the momentum building. We've just begun to scratch the surface of what this company will become. I'm confident we have the right team in place to execute our multi-year roadmaps, implement our critical go-to-market changes, launch our new channel strategy and partner programs and continue to make progress on our successful transformation. We'll be satisfied when we reach our 5 and 30 goal, but that would mean we'd still be losing share. In my career, I've never run a business that lost share. So while we'd be satisfied with beating 5 and 30, we wouldn't be happy. We are setting our sights much higher. In the meantime, we'll continue to work hard executing our strategy and putting points on the board so we can consistently deliver better results for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. Thanks for your support. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James.", "James A. Beer", "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon. I'm pleased by our overall performance in the June quarter while we concurrently made progress towards simplifying our organization and planning for significant sales and go-to-market changes. In the September quarter, we'll be implementing our new sales organization structure, territories and compensation plan.", "June quarter GAAP revenue grew 3% in constant currency to $1.71 billion. Organic constant currency revenue also grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strength in our Backup, Information Security and Endpoint Security businesses. As more customers are choosing to purchase subscription services, our total subscription businesses grew 5% and accounted for 45% of total revenue compared to 44% of revenue in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which exclude the Norton business, grew 12% and accounted for 15% of total revenue as compared to 14% in the prior year. In aggregate, 89% of total revenue was ratable in the June quarter.", "GAAP operating margin for the implement -- excuse me, in alignment with our 4.0 strategy, we created 3 new business segments. We also allocated certain shared expenses from the Other segment into our 3 new segments in order to provide a clearer picture of segment profitability.", "Now, to review the results of these new segments. The User Productivity & Protection segment, which is comprised of Endpoint Security and Management, encryption and mobile businesses, grew 1% to $732 million. We are pleased with the continued growth of our Endpoint Security businesses driven by growth in both Norton and Enterprise Endpoint Protection. We expect growth in our Endpoint Security businesses to be flattish for the balance of the fiscal year. This growth was offset by weakness in our Endpoint Management business due in part to customer uncertainty surrounding previous divestiture rumors in the early part of 2013.", "GAAP operating margin for the User Productivity & Production segment was 35%, flat year-over-year. The Information Security segment, which includes our authentication, mail and web security, hosted security services, data center security, MSS and DLP offerings, grew 9% to $336 million. Our trust services business continues to perform well, in part because many of our customers are choosing to protect more corporate website interactions rather than just the sites that involve e-commerce transactions. GAAP operating margin for the Information Security segment was 8% compared to negative 3% in the year-ago period as we begin to scale our emerging Information Security portfolio.", "The Information Management segment drew -- grew 4% to $641 million and is comprised of our offerings related to backup and recovery; information intelligence which includes archiving and e-Discovery; and information availability which we previously referred to as storage management.", "Our backup and recovery businesses grew high single digits, driven by double-digit growth in NetBackup, offset by continued weakness in Backup Exec. Strength continued in our integrated backup appliances as customers look for ways to simplify their expanding backup environments. According to a recent IDC report, our share of the backup appliance market for the first quarter of calendar 2013 has more than doubled year-over-year, driving us into the #2 share position. GAAP operating margin for the Information Management segment was down 4 percentage points year-over-year to 23% as we continue to invest in areas such as appliances and technical support.", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margins declined 59 basis points year-over-year to 83.6% as we continue to grow our subscription and appliance businesses. GAAP operating margin was 13.1%, down 190 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by $83 million in restructuring and transition charges. Employee layoff notifications occurred in May and June, as well as in the month of July. We expect the balance of our projected severance and benefits payments of $220 million to $250 million to be realized throughout the rest of the fiscal year.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.3%, up 36 basis points year-over-year as increased commission expenses and investments in R&D were offset by top line growth and lower-than-expected OEM fees. Non-GAAP net income of $308 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 7% year-over-year as reported, driven primarily by improved operating leverage from stronger-than-expected revenue performance. Deferred revenue was $3.81 billion, down sequentially as expected and in line with historical seasonal patterns. Year-over-year, deferred revenue grew 3%.", "We exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.8 billion, following the maturity of our $1 billion of convertible notes. Approximately 41% of our cash balance resides onshore. In the June quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. On June 27, we paid our first dividend of $0.15 per share for a total of $105 million. We also spent $125 million to repurchase 5.2 million shares at an average share price of $23.96. Symantec has approximately $1 billion remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan.", "Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $312 million, down 8% year-over-year driven primarily by spending on operational improvements in areas such as support and our ongoing ERP implementation.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our guidance. For FY '14, we reiterate our constant currency revenue guidance of 0% to 2% growth and non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 200 basis points. As a reminder, we continue to expect a currency headwind driven primarily by weakness in the yen. We also expect non-GAAP EPS to grow between 5% to 7% in FY '14. We have identified $350 million in annual spending that is not aligned with our 4.0 strategy. We have reallocated the majority of these resources to key growth opportunities, and the remaining savings will be used to expand operating margins in fiscal '14. As discussed last quarter, we expect cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2014 to be down approximately $200 million year-over-year driven by severance cash payments.", "Our September quarter guidance takes into consideration the significant changes our sales organization will be undergoing, as well as the associated risk. These changes include realigning our sales territories faster than expected, reducing costs through headcount reductions, redesigning the coverage model, launching the new renewals team, converting our generalist sales force to one that's specialized, focusing our sales organization on new business only and redefining compensation incentives.", "For the September 2013 quarter, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the year-ago period. Approximately 77% or $1.28 billion of our September quarter revenue is estimated to come from the balance sheet. We expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 13.6% to 14.2% compared to 17.5% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 25.8% to 26.4% compared to 27% last year.", "GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.22 and $0.24 as compared to $0.27 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.42 and $0.44 as compared to $0.45 in the year-ago period. We expect cash flow from operations to be down slightly year-over-year compared to the September 2012 quarter, driven by cash outflows related to severance payments. As part of our enhanced capital allocation strategy, we will issue a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, equivalent to a yield of 2.5% based on the closing stock price of $24.25 on July 25, 2013. Payment will occur on September 18 to shareholders of record on August 26. In addition to paying dividends, we will also continue to buy back our shares.", "Our guidance for both the quarter and the full year assumes an effective tax rate of 27.5%. We expect common stock equivalents for the quarter of approximately 705 million shares and expect our share count to remain flat for the full year.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Helyn so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, James. Gwen, will you please start polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on our upcoming investor events. We'll be presenting at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 4 in New York. We will be reporting our fiscal second quarter results on October 23. For a complete schedule of our investor-related events, please visit the Events section of the Investor Relations website. Gwen, we're ready for our first question.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And great job especially considering all that's going on, not only at Symantec but in the environment more generally. Steve, on the product side, can you talk about the progress you're making on the new solution areas and when we might hear additional details on what the initial offerings look like? And is it fair to say that a changing product roadmap might have impacted customer decisions and caused some hesitation, the results might have otherwise been even better or am I stretching here?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "You're stretching. I think that we just shared with our sales force and obviously, we've been sharing with some of our customers these roadmaps when we had our Worldwide Sales and Marketing Conference a couple of weeks ago. And the feedback from both customers, partners and salespeople has been very, very positive. And so we are trying to figure out what the right path is. I know we'll talk about this at Investor Day next May, and my guess is there -- that you'll see some of this between now and then, and we don't really have a good path on this. But it's -- of the 10 new offerings that we announced, we still have 10. One didn't make it and we came up with the idea of one new one. And so your feedback, all of your feedback to Helyn and the best way for us to share some of these data would be helpful. But I think that it did not affect revenue in the current period, but we're excited about how it'll help us meet the 5% CAGR that we talked about longer term.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Steve and James, you listed a good 1/2 dozen vectors of change to the sales model heading into 2Q. It seems unprecedented the degree of change. But is there any reference point in the past that gives confidence that your guidance sufficiently accounts for the risks associated with all these changes that you're making?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I think it's important to recognize how much of our revenue in the quarter is ratable. So I particularly drew reference in the June quarter to that 89% number. And for the September quarter, the starting balance sheet will drive 77% of our revenue. And then we'll add to that based on ratable activity from in-period sales. So I think that should give you some comfort as to the revenue guide that we put out there.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And just a very quick follow-up, sir, just based on that comment, would it be fair to say that as we model deferreds into September that maybe we should exercise a little bit more conservatism than typical seasonality?", "James A. Beer", "I think that's probably appropriate. That would certainly be consistent with the approach that we've taken for setting the guidance range.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, it sounds like you started separating...", "Helyn Corcos", "John, we can't hear you. Can you speak up please?", "[Technical Difficulty]", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, it sounds like you started separating maintenance renewals from the sale of new business this quarter, or at least got the ball rolling. But I think either you or James said that you'll have the renewals team fully up and running by the end of the fiscal year. I guess, can you give us a little more detail on the status of that? Are you rolling that out regionally? And if you are, where are you, I guess, here in the -- I would assume, you would -- if you're going to do that, you might do it here in the U.S. first. But can you give us a little more detail on that? That would be helpful.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, I think, John, what we talked about was we're rolling it out in a thoughtful way as we talked about, going as fast as we feel comfortable with given all the moving parts. And so we're not going to release kind of the details by country or geo, and I think it'll be different in Asia Pacific based on the different languages that there might be in the U.S. or Europe. And so I think the -- we launched in the second quarter in some geographies, and some will come in later in the year and we expect to launch in all of them between now and the end of the fiscal year. I think that's kind of what we wanted to talk about at this point.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could, James, you maintained a constant currency guidance for the year for the top line of 0% to 2% growth. Our math would indicate the reported numbers, given where the currencies are today relative to a year ago, would indicate something in the order of minus 2% to 0% growth. Because I think there's -- the reason I'm asking is because I think there's some confusion out there with investors. Is that accurate? Would that be the reported if it's 0% to 2% constant currency?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, that would be consistent with the sort of headwind that we're looking at in that range, yes.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a mark-to-market on where we are with particularly some of these changes in the sales reorg. We often look at sort of the beginning of fiscal year as the time that these sale changes take place, granted this might be a little bit of a different scenario considering you overall rework. But to what degree do these sales changes start in Q1? How far are we through them when you look to this stuff about realigning sales territories and redesigning the coverage models and stuff like that?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think we shared what we wanted to share, Keith. And we said that we turned on the renewals part in some parts of the world in Q2 that -- and that we are in the process of implementing new territories and James' Information Management and Information Security specialization. And those changes are in play and they're going to happen between now and the end of the fiscal year where we're going to implement all the changes that we talked about in some sequential fashion. Yes, so none of those changes were in place in Q1. And we have a traditional model where an enterprise field salesperson was getting compensated on new and renew, but that was really for the last time. But what was covered in Q1 is that we eliminated and changed the entire management structure of the sales force, so it's not that the sales force was not impacted in -- but we impacted sales management in Q1, but not salespeople. Now, we start with some changes that are affecting salespeople.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. If I could sneak one more in, one of the concerns heading into the new fiscal year was the idea that perhaps at the end of your prior fiscal year, salespeople seeing these changes on the horizon would have drained the pipeline. Obviously, we didn't see that impact in Q1 results. How are you guys feeling about the overall pipeline right now? Are the build rates -- are they sort of in line with your expectations?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think we feel surprisingly good. We've looked at the data for the first 3 months of the second quarter and we're ahead of the previous year. So we did not see -- and we put governors on the amount of renewals so that people could get commissioned on in Q1, so we actually feel like -- that we managed Q1 -- we didn't try and maximize Q1. I think it happened naturally, and we're ahead of where we were through the first 3 weeks of July versus last year, and so we feel quite excited about. I think the thing that's most important is there's a lot of positive energy in our company you right now, and we've gone through some tough changes in Q1. We're going to go through some more in Q2. But there's a lot of positive energy from all of our employees, and I think they like what's going and I think they're stepping up their game. And that's sometimes hard to predict, the impact that will have at the end of the quarter. But there's a lot of positive momentum for us in -- with our employees.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "James, I want to ask you about the expense impact here of the restructuring that you saw in the quarter. And could you help us out in understanding the, I think it was $996 million in OpEx? How much of that had the restructuring in it and how much is still to come in terms of -- I know you've had kind of a mid-quarter impact of the actions you took?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, so our restructuring and transition expenses are GAAP-only items. And so that's $83 million for the quarter, and the significant majority of that was driven by severance, the balance was driven by ongoing ERP implementation. So I would expect that we'd see a larger number in Q2 as we build on through our reorganization process. We've got through very significant majority of the employee notifications at this point. The activity in terms of booking the severance and so forth comes a little later.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. I guess I was more focused on the ongoing run rate of expenses and understanding that you probably didn't see the full benefit of the restructuring, the restructuring on the run rate of OpEx, not the charges you were taking. Can you talk about just the run rate of expenses that you saw in the June quarter and how much of those come down just simply based on having a full quarter impact of that -- those actions you took mid-quarter [indiscernible] June quarter?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, we saw relatively little impact in the June quarter just because of the timing of what I was mentioning a little earlier there. And so I would expect that to start picking up in the September quarter and be getting closer to a full quarterly run rate in the third quarter.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, the restructuring impact will be picking up. But the cost -- the benefits will be starting to -- the cost base will start to go down, yes, and we'll see more of that in Q2. And then in the second half will be more into the full run rate benefit, if you will.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Steve, from an operational alignment, is there a milemarker you could give us a sense of kind of how far you are through unveiling the playbook you want to put in place? Are you 60%, 70% of the way through? Are you 40%? I don't know what the right number to think about, but can you give us a sense of, just from a high level, where you're at and maybe the next big things that you feel like you need to do now considering the success of the initial plan?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "We're at the 1-mile mark in a marathon, so 1-mile mark out of 26 miles. And the flywheel is just starting to spin. We had our officers' meeting where we got the top 140 people in the company together a couple of weeks ago. I will tell you, the people that were here before and are still here are different people than they were a year ago in a positive sense, and I shared an interesting statistic with the officers that investors probably should see, too. Of the top 12 people that were running the company a year ago, 7 are no longer with the company. And our officer population, which was 146, I think, a year ago, 70 are no longer with the company. So we've had quite a significant leadership transition. We've attracted some great talent from the outside, and the 70-plus officers that were here a year ago, that are still here, including both James and Helyn, are different people in a positive sense than they were a year ago. So we're -- but we're at the 1-mile marker on a long-term journey and there's no big silver bullets, there's no big catalysts here. It's going to be slow and steady, build a foundation a brick at a time and continue to -- on the path to make this company the best that it can be.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just to build on some of the prior questions asked about sort of just where we are in terms of just the changes into the sales force. Clearly, some went into this quarter, some of it sounds like it's going to be going on here in fiscal Q2. But when do you sort of expect to have, for example, your most quotas in place, the realignment on sort of the complete rollout of the renewals team kind of as you think of sort of milemarkers over the course of this year?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Okay, I think we're not going to give you guys the details you keep asking for because we don't want to be held accountable to the timeline details on implementing something that we're moving as fast as we can. I think it's safe to say that more will happen earlier rather than later, but that will be complete by the end of the fiscal year.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Then just to slide one in there. I guess with some of the relationships you have on the PC OEM side, just wondering if you could give us an update just on your kind of general thinking about the upsides or the downside from those with some of these and once come up for renewal over the next couple of years?", "James A. Beer", "Yes, I think that as we've been quite clear on in the past, nothing has changed. And current deals we have are not attractive to us, and we'd be financially ahead if we didn't have the deals we have. And it might hurt us a little bit on revenue, but we'd be financially ahead. That hasn't changed, and so we don't know what's going to happen. Time will tell. We're not going to sign another money-losing deal, I can guarantee you on that. And so time will tell and we'll see how that all plays out.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Steve, you've talked a lot about partnerships with other security companies. I think you've also referred to this maybe as the information security service. But I apologize for asking the stupid question here, but maybe you could help us out with sort of how the economics of those transactions will work if you sell that to your customer base? And then maybe for James, is that more of a sort of ratable model? Should we expect a little bit different shift over the years as this gains some traction?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think -- no, I think it's actually a really good question. And I think the answer is it'll be completely a service, it will completely ratable, so I can handle that one for James. I think the concept here is MSS on steroids with much broader and more capability, which integrates our stuff into a platform with third-party stuff. Because as we said in the third element of our offering strategy that we've learned that we can integrate with third parties to deliver even more value for customers, and we're working on those deals. I have a meeting tomorrow actually with one of them, and we've been having meetings for quite a while. So I think it will be completely of service, and you'll start to see modules of that coming in the roadmap as early as within 6 months. And so -- but it will be a slow and steady release of these new capabilities, that's why they're multi-year roadmaps, and we're very excited about it. Every CIO I've talked to about this ISS concept said, \"If you had that, I'd buy it\". And how will the economics work? We haven't figured all that out yet, but we will deliver a lot of value to customers. And my view is we will get paid for the value we deliver for customers because we will save them a lot of money and we'll also have nice margins in those services.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And a quick follow-up, if I could. You talked a lot about some of the changes at the sales management level. But last week, you also talked or had a release out of some several senior management additions to the company. Are you complete on sort of that higher-level management additions there? Can you just update on that side of it?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, we just hired a CMO and we're -- I think their first day is Thursday. And so that is a really, really key hire for us and we've got really a spectacular individual that's chosen to join our team as the CMO. And I think we -- at the top, we're pretty -- in pretty good shape. I think we'll continue to evolve. And we have high-performance standards here, so that doesn't mean we'll ever be done. I think we'll continue to evolve. But I think for the most part, in the top 23 or 24 people that sit around the table with me every 2 weeks and run the company, I think we've got a strong team and it's getting better individually and collectively. And I'm very excited about the progress we're making.", "Operator", "We'll go next to James Wesman with Raymond James.", "James Wesman", "It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. First question, on the User Productivity & Protection division, how do you feel it will be impacted by PC shipments? I know you'd said you felt the Endpoint business would be flat, but there are other tech vendors that have said that they thought PCs would likely be down double digits next quarter and down for the foreseeable future. Do you feel like that division can grow for the quarter and for the year with this set?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "We just did. I mean, we just told you that we just grew in Endpoint today despite headwinds in Altiris, we grew Norton and we grew our SEP Enterprise business. So the -- and we're also doing well in mobile. Actually, I just saw an e-mail beforehand. We just got a $1.4 million mobile deal from a very large retailer, so I think that just booked like today. So I think that we've estimated in all of our forecasts, in 5 and 30, that the Endpoint market was going to be flat. So that said, we grew Norton and we grew our Enterprise Endpoint business this quarter despite PC sales. So I think this big focus on PC sales having some dramatic impact on Symantec is -- was a great question 10 years ago, to be honest, when that was really all we did. But this is a much more diversified portfolio now, and we do all sorts of different things. And so I don't think PC sales has a huge positive or negative impact on us because of all the other opportunities that we're in that are growing double digits. And as we shift our focus from markets that aren't growing to markets that are and do some innovation, I think we can more than offset the flat growth that we expect in the Endpoint business.", "James Wesman", "Got it. And a quick follow-up for James. James, gross margins were down slightly year-over-year this quarter, makes sense with the appliance SaaS businesses growing. Should we expect that trend to continue for the rest of the year and for the foreseeable future?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I think that we'll continue to grow our appliances and subscription businesses, but at the same time, we'll continue to look for ways to make more efficient and effective the costs that create the COGS. So I think directionally, I'd be looking for gross margins around where they are at the moment. So that's what we're focusing on.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "And a thing I would add to that -- James, I would add to that is this is an important thing for -- at least philosophically, for me to share. At the end of the day, we're solving for in a committed operating margin increases. Gross margins are driven by the mix of business and all sorts of other things. And so some of the new products that we're going to grow -- are going to have different gross margin structure, and that's -- we're going to be competitive and we're going to grow. So at the end of the day, it's important for investors, at least to know my very strong philosophy, it's about revenue growth, organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion. And so I felt like I was compelled to share that today.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit, as you're moving more into the kind of services marketplace, do you see yourself competing more against service providers being more of a partner? How do you think about that relationship?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, I think that's a really -- Robert, I think that's a really good question. I think as we are in the process of, and I'm intimately involved in a whole new kind of channel strategy for us where I think we have all sorts of interesting opportunities, one of the big things we're talking about is exactly that point that you brought up. And so stay tuned for that. At some point here, it's one of the things that we've talked about in terms of go-to-market enhancements that we think is going to create a lot of value for both the channel and for our customers and allow us to be, frankly, more productive is to have a really powerful partner and channel strategy and program, which we really didn't have in the past. Our strategy in the past was everybody sells everything, that was our channel strategy. And so we're going to be much more strategic, and I think one of the areas we're focusing a lot on is service providers, whether they'd be telcos or whether they'd be some of the hosted service providers and how do we have right-for-me offerings and value propositions for these different channels and have a much more strategic look. And so I think it's a big opportunity for us and stay tuned for some additional insight from us as we firm that up.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. Maybe as a follow-up just pertains -- if you think about taxes, it's always difficult for us, do you see any significant change as we go into next year as you kind of start off this year from a tax rate perspective?", "James A. Beer", "No, I wouldn't expect significant changes to the tax rate, so I'd stick with the 27.5% guide.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One question for you, Steve. What -- can you share a little bit more details on the changes in the go-to-market strategy from a sales standpoint starting this quarter? And one for you James. We've heard quite a few numbers here, $350 million in savings. And you expect next year's cash flow -- or this year's cash flow rather to be down by about $200 million. Can you just walk us through how the restructuring items in the payouts are going to be impacting your financial statements over the next couple of quarters?", "James A. Beer", "Okay, so in terms of the $350 million of cost that we've identified is not being consistent with the strategy. We have redirected the majority of those to things that are important for the strategy that are going to drive growth. And the remaining money, we're letting it drop to the bottom line to achieve our 200-basis-point margin improvement goal. In terms of cash flow, that will be impacted obviously by the severance charges that we'll be expecting to pay out over the coming several months here. So that will really be the driver. I would expect, beyond this transitional period, to see our cash flow from operations growing consistent directionally with our operating profit growth.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So one thing I would add to that, I think it's important for investors to understand, of the $350 million that James talked about, where we're giving $100 million to investors in terms of margin expansion. On the $250 million that we're reinvesting, I think it's important for investors to understand that 80% of that is being invested in things that will produce no fiscal year '14 benefit. So we really have shifted the focus to put more money into things that are going to power longer term growth, and we're quite excited about -- that's a big change for us. And so 80% on no fiscal year '14 benefit and $50 million of that $250 million, we think, could have some impact later on this year.", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And on the go-to-market, Steve, if you don't mind?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. So if you want to just repeat that question?", "Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, the -- I was curious on what exactly any specificity on the changes in the go-to-market strategy that you envision if -- starting this quarter, better sales alignment, focus? I just wanted to understand the specifics of what exactly is being done.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think the more macro thought is we've got really 4 or 5 things that we are implementing this year starting in the second quarter, and I think you've heard about all of them between the scripts today. One is we're launching the renewals team. Two, we're changing our sales force from farmers to hunters and paying only on new business. Three, we're focusing the majority of our sales force on being information management or information security specialists. Four, we're working on a new channel strategy that we talked about. And five, we are in the process of retooling our sales incentives over time to pay on profit and revenue, but that won't affect us until fiscal year '15. So those are really the 5 levers that we are filtering in between now and the last one, which will be a fiscal year '15 impact. And so we're not going to get into the details on when we're doing what by country or region or all of that or all those things. We just kind of shared those are the 5 major things we're implementing, and we're doing it as fast as we can and as thoughtful as we can to minimize disruption, all of which we are confident are going to make us a higher performing, faster growth company in the long term.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to shift here a little bit. We talked a lot about the internal drivers for your performance. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in macro? There's a big debate over the things are getting slightly better or not, and I'm just -- specifically wanted to focus on the deals over $1 million, which was up quite significantly year-over-year, but then also kind of talk a little bit about the regions. Asia seems to be the weak spot for a lot of people. Your growth there was 1% still good, but probably the bigger part of their performance overall. So just what are you seeing there?", "James A. Beer", "Well, I'd say in terms of the macro economy, just slow, steady improvements. There -- fundamentally, there's good demand for both the storage and the security side of our product access. And we've got a terrific set of point products in the market today. And as you've heard, we're busy building the integrated offerings to complement those current products. In terms of the big deals, yes, we were pleased that both the greater than a $1 million and greater than $300k-type deals were off significantly. Those stats can move around from one quarter to another. Geographically, pleased with the European result there at 6% growth, obviously, challenging macro backdrop in Europe, very steady Americas growth as well. Asia, yes, 1%. The story there was around Japan, where we saw some weakness around Norton on the retail level. And in the previous quarter, Q4, Japan had a particularly strong Enterprise quarter. So again, we feel comfortable with the trajectory of the business in Asia Pacific.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Your information security business grew 9% constant currency and you referenced trust services being strong, just wondering what else in particular did well in that segment to get to that level of growth?", "James A. Beer", "Well, it was really a range of the different offerings there. So I wouldn't call out anything particularly beyond there were several of the product areas, DLP, Managed Security Services, so it was a good result all around.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I know you've been investing a lot in that segment, but your operating margins were only 4% last year, although it did improve to high single digits this quarter. Steve, what sort of margin, I guess, do you aspire to for that segment if you look out 2 to 3 years or so?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, I think it's a good question, Gregg. And I'm not sure we know because we are investing a lot and we're -- but we're breaking down a lot of barriers in these new offerings and we've had all these silos and redundancies. And so I think this is one of the variables we have to play with. It's a growth market, and we've got good positions and we think we can grow faster and we think we can improve the margins. And I don't have a kind of -- I don't know enough to have an opinion about whether it should be a 25% operating margin business. But I think the more meta point that you're alluding to is over time, my philosophy on this, and some of you have heard me say this, is, look, we want to deliver against the 5 and 30 and put that in the rearview mirror and prove that. And then I think the discussion we're going to have, which is an extension, Gregg, of your question is, okay, now do we deliver more margin or do we deliver faster organic growth and how do we tradeoff between those 2? So my focus at this point is to get over the 5 and 30 hurdle, frankly, as fast as we can. And then second, start -- we'll know more at that point because that's not going to be next quarter. That might be in 1 year, 1.5 years or 2 years. Then we'll know more about our team's ability to execute and invest and deliver, and then we'll have the discussion about operating margin expansion versus organic revenue growth. And at the end, my bias would be the market opportunities are there, the faster we can drive organic growth, the more leverage -- the more value we're going to create for our shareholders. But that's where everybody rightfully is the most skeptical, so let's prove 5 and 30 and then have this discussion after we're over the 5 and 30 bar. So if I could -- I love your question, I'd love to defer it for 1 year or 2 and then have it. And you can hold me to that, bring that up in a couple of years when we're above the hurdle.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Chaitanya Yaramada for Steve Ashley. Just had a question on sales quotas, and I know a lot of things are changing. But could you comment on maybe how the aggregate sales quarter may look like at the end of this year, this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year? And also you'll be handling these renewals through a separate team by the end of the year, so allowing the sales reps to focus on new business. So how -- what does that mean for sales rep quotas and how will you structure that?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, the sales rep quotas are going to go down because they're only focused on new business. And the renewals team will have the quota for renewals. So look, I think -- hopefully, you can trust us to manage that because that's a pretty basic thing when you're running a $7 billion company. I think at the end of the day, we believe we're going to have better performance on both fronts because we have focus on new license and incentives aligned with that and we have focus and incentives aligned on renewals. And I think that focus and leadership from the top down will produce better outcomes, and we're quite confident since that's really the norm for everybody else in the industry. Other -- that's a better way to run the railroad. And so we're just copying other people's best practices a few years after they all went that way.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Steve Bennett for any closing remarks.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So, everybody, thanks for the support. I really am pleased with the performance this quarter. It was way above what I expected. We've been thoughtful about what we've shared. In the next quarter, we're going to try and do the best we can do, but there is some uncertainty and we're quite confident about the 0% to 2% for the year and the path to the 30% margins or the 200 basis points for this year, anyway. But there's a lot of moving parts, and I hope you don't get ahead of me here, which you could, because there's a lot of uncertainty. But at the end of the day, we're going to make this company the best we can be. But we're solving -- we're creating long-term value, not short-term value. And so we're going to take any kind of short-term transition pain to get it right so that we can make this 5 and 30 commitment we made in the January announcement. So thanks for your support and look forward to reporting on how we delivered in the second quarter and maybe to see some of you at the Citi Conference in New York.

Before we get into the details of the September quarter, which obviously did not meet my expectations, I'd like to provide some context on how I view Symantec's role in what Gartner is calling, the digital industrial economy.", "We've entered a new era where the physical and digital worlds are converging rapidly. It demands an integrated, holistic approach to protecting and managing information and we're building on our strong assets to transform Symantec to take advantage of this massive shift. I truly believe the world has never needed a stronger Symantec than it does today. But many changes are required to transform a company of our size and complexity so we can help protect our customers from increasingly sophisticated attacks and solve their problems better than anyone else. And in doing so, we believe we can deliver consistent and sustained organic growth.", "Six months into our transformation, after the January announcement, we feel good about the progress on most fronts. However, this was a more challenging than expected top-line quarter in a transitional year. We fell short on revenue, while delivering on both operating margin rate and EPS. I'm disappointed that our performance fell outside our revenue guidance range. We underestimated -- I underestimated the impact of the go-to-market changes we made. It was challenging quarter. However, we remain solidly convinced that these changes are required to position Symantec for long-term success. And we are not backing away from our long-term targets of greater than 5% growth CAGR and better than 30% operating margin for the fiscal year '15 to fiscal year '17 time frame.", "In fact, the excitement and positive feedback we are getting from customers and partners to our new offerings and go-to-market changes, coupled with greater employee engagement, make me as confident as ever in our ability to achieve our long-term targets.", "As we evaluated the root cause for the miss, we analyzed every angle: products, geographies, segments, big deals, government spending, you name it. We boiled it down to a single critical area that drove the miss: new license sales, direct-to-customers and through partners. Part of our shortfall was due to some second quarter sales that were pulled into the first quarter before we implemented changes to our sales model. But the majority of the impact to our results was due to significantly changing our coverage model for more than 90% of our direct sales people.", "We went from traditional generalists, selling 150-or-so point solution to sales people that are now Information Management or Information Security Specialists. We clearly lost more momentum than we expected in the transition and are working hard to address all the critical levers to accelerate progress in building a robust new business pipeline in Q3 and Q4, so we regain our positive momentum going into fiscal year '15.", "The enterprise sales cycle can often have long lead times. Consequently, we expect it to take us a few quarters for our sales force to regain its momentum. We expect positive year-over-year sales activity to begin in the first or second quarter of fiscal year '15.", "When the dust settles from the transition of our sales force gains traction, momentum builds from our improved sales force focus. We have new releases of some of our leading point solutions, such as NetBackup, Appliances and Endpoint Security, to name a few. There are initial launches of some of our new integrated solutions addressing data center security, information security and innovative defense against advanced persistent threats. And finally, key industry partnerships begin to gain customer acceptance and produce results. We also believe we will see improved commercial execution as we build out our marketing organization and better enable our salespeople and partners to be more effective and productive. We are making solid progress providing our sales team and partners the messaging and tools required to better share our exciting new story with the market.", "The magnitude of change we're implementing during this transition year, coupled with the second quarter shortfall, will impact results during the second half of fiscal year 2014. We want to be prudent with our guidance for the remainder of the year. As such, we are reducing our fiscal year guidance targets. That said, since our strategy and transformation journey is not changing, we are not going to make across-the-board spending reductions to drive short-term improved financial results at the expense of longer term success. We will, as always, continue to identify and eliminate areas of inefficiency and redundancy, so we better allocate resources to drive growth.", "Let me step back from this quarter and share some perspective on the changes we've been working on. Let's start with where we were just a year ago. Symantec was a company that had -- that sold point products based on features and functionality, had a generalist sales structure that was high-cost, had non-differentiated volume-based rewards for channel partners, was organized in silos and had an inefficient management structure. Simply put, our structure, incentives and culture were hampering our ability to deliver value to customers and partners and limiting our growth.", "Since the January announcement of our new strategy, we've made significant progress in changing many key foundational elements of the company starting with upgrading our offerings; evaluating our existing point solutions and reallocating dollars based on the competitive position and market opportunity; resourcing dedicated teams to build the 10 new integrated offerings that solve higher order customer problems; bringing on lighthouse customers as early adopters of our new innovative offerings. Customers are excited about our offering strategy and want to participate in the development process.", "On the network security partnership front, we completed 2 preliminary customer pilots and are actively working with other select joint customers for additional feedback. Feedback from the 2 pilots has been positive and have confirmed our approach of satisfying our customers' underserved needs relative to advanced threat protection. We are preparing to announce our partnerships and new offerings during the RSA Conference early next year.", "We also launched many critical elements in the complete revamping of our go-to-market strategy and plan during the September quarter. We split the sales organization into renewals and new business teams. We successfully launched our centrally managed renewals group, which is focused exclusively on this important revenue stream. This team provides a high-quality, cost effective approach to the renewals process and improves the value we deliver to customers by making it easier to do business with us. We're pleased with the renewal team's performance this quarter. We also changed the roles of our direct new business sales reps to focus on new business only and specializing on either Information Security or Information Management.", "We are also enabling our e-business platform into a digital experience that will enable anyone to discover purchase and receive product help online with real-time customer care. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to reach and acquire a new set of customers. Some of the things we are working on that will help us in the long term include, significantly improving our e-business served market by expanding our payment options, global expansion of our e-business platform and advancing our search capabilities. We made significant progress in defining our channel strategy and redesigning our partner program to better align our offerings with the optimal route-to-market and our channel capability.", "We are investing more time and resources in our channel to build stronger, more strategic partner relationships. Further, we will align the economics and incentives based on the value created by the partner and their commitment to Symantec and our customers. We will unveil the framework of our new partner strategy at our North America Partner Engage Event in November.", "We have also made progress with our team, functionalizing and upgrading the leadership team. We've lost some key senior people, but we've added a lot of top talent to the senior leadership team. And this is expected in a transformation of this type. We've improved the engagement and energy of our employees and we've simplified the management structure by reducing middle-management by 35%.", "We remain focused on 3 priority areas: offerings; go-to-market; and a third concept we call work smart which is all about better execution and being easier to do business with through investing in our people, process and technology.", "In summary, we have begun the operational phase of our transition. With a focus in all 3 of our priority areas, I am more encouraged than ever in our vision and strategy to drive growth in the long term. It will take some time for our transformation changes to translate into revenue, but I'm confident we are on the right track. We have a lot of work ahead of us. We greatly appreciate the support and confidence from our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. We are working diligently to assure that we enter next year a stronger, better company with an ever bright future. And with that, thanks for your support and let me turn it over to Drew to provide a review of our financial results and guidance.", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon. The second quarter was a transition quarter, as we implemented significant sales force and go-to-market changes. These structural changes resulted in lower than expected revenue. However, we are confident that these changes will create a more effective and efficient sales model and support our goals to achieve better than 5% organic revenue growth and greater than 30% operating margin in the '15 to '17 fiscal year time frame.", "In the September quarter, organic revenue declined 4% year-over-year and GAAP revenue declined 3% to $1.64 billion driven by lower than expected license revenue. The license revenues declined 31% year-over-year in the September quarter, while content, maintenance and subscription revenue was flat. In aggregate, 92% of total revenue in the September quarter was ratable. Our total subscription revenue was flat year-over-year and accounted for 46% of total revenue compared to 45% of revenue in the year-ago period. Enterprise subscriptions, which excludes Norton revenue, grew 1% and accounted for 15% of total revenue as compared to 14% in the prior year.", "Turning now to our business segments, our User Productivity and Protection Segment, which is comprised of our Endpoint Security, Endpoint Management, Encryption and Mobile businesses declined 2% to $719 million. Flattish performance in our Endpoint businesses was offset by continued weakness in Endpoint Management. GAAP operating margin for this segment was 36%, flat year-over-year as lower marketing spend offset lower revenue.", "The Information Security segment, which includes our authentication, mail and web security, hosted security services, data center security, Managed Security Services and Data Loss Prevention offerings, declined 1% to $316 million. Continued growth in our authentication and MSS businesses were offset by weakness in our mail, web and data center security businesses. GAAP operating margin for this segment was 16% compared to 4% in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower sales and marketing expenses.", "The Information Management segment, which includes our offerings related to backup and recovery; information intelligence, which includes archiving and e-discovery; and information availability, which we previously referred to as Storage Management, declined 6% to $602 million. Continued growth in our NetBackup appliances was offset by weakness in our Backup Exec and information availability offerings. GAAP operating margin for this segment was down 4 percentage points year-over-year to 24%, driven by our increasing appliance mix on lower revenue.", "Turning now to total company margins. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 80 basis points year-over-year to 83.7% due to lower revenue and continued growth in our appliance and hosted solutions. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.6%, flat year-over-year as lower revenue was offset by organizational simplification benefits and lower sales and marketing spend. Non-GAAP net income of $355 million resulted in fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, up 11% year-over-year as reported driven by a one-time tax benefit from a favorable IRS settlement.", "Deferred revenue was $3.5 billion, down 3% year-over-year driven by lower than expected sales activity. We exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.8 billion, approximately 47% of our cash resides onshore.", "In the September quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. On September 18, we paid a $0.15 per share dividend for a total of $105 million. We also spent $125 million to repurchase 5 million shares at an average price of $24.99. Symantec has approximately $908 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $191 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the timing of payroll payments.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. We remain confident in our business over the long term and we're committed to delivering greater than 5% revenue growth and better than 30% operating margin in the '15 to '17 fiscal year time frame. Given the September quarter shortfall and the significant transformation we are driving, we're being prudent in lowering annual guidance. We expect revenue for fiscal 2014 to be down 3% to 4% in constant currency as our sales force focuses on building new business and our renewal team -- our renewals team concentrates on extending customer relationships. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand 30 to 60 basis points as our strategy remains unchanged and we continue to invest in driving organic growth by solving our customers' large unmet and underserved needs. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between negative 1% and positive 1.5% compared to the prior fiscal year.", "For the December 2013 quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.67 billion compared to $1.79 billion in the year-ago period. Approximately 75% or $1.24 billion of our December quarter revenue is estimated to come from our balance sheet. We expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 17% to 17.6% compared to 17% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 25.6% to 26.2% compared to 25.9% last year. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.26 and $0.28 as compared to $0.31 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be between $0.41 and $0.43 as compared to $0.45 in the year-ago period. Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro, plus the weighted average rate of $1.30 versus -- our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.35 per euro versus the weighted average rate of $1.30 and the end of period rate of $1.32 per euro in the December 2012 quarter.", "Our guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 28% for the December and March quarters. We expect common stock equivalents for the quarter of approximately 707 million shares and expect our share count to remain flat for the full year. As part of our enhanced capital allocation strategy, we will issue a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. Payment will occur on December 18 to shareholders of record on November 25.", "In addition to paying dividends, we will also continue to buyback our shares.", "And now I will turn it over to Helyn, so that we can start taking some of your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, Drew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Helyn Corcos", "While the operator is polling for questions, I'd like to update you on our upcoming conference events. We will be presenting at the UBS Technology Conference on November 21 in Sausalito and at the NASDAQ Conference on December 4 in London. For a complete schedule of our investor-related events and materials, please visit the Events section on the Investor Relations website.", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve -- a question for Steve and then a follow-up for Drew. Steve, I understand you saw more transition disruption than you expected with the sales force for new license in the quarter, but you also said you were pleased with the new renewal team and their performance. I know it's their first quarter of doing this, but can you quantify that at all? Was the -- were the renewal rates of maintenance or subscription worse, about the same, or better than it was before?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "About the same. I mean, we just got up and running, and about the same on the renewal rates, but obviously much lower cost as we do this more with a different business model than we did with -- than we had with the old model, John.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And Drew, we were modeling restructuring costs to decline in this quarter, I don't know that's what we thought -- we -- that's what we were modeling. But it actually increased. I guess, can you talk a little bit about why that happened and how we should think about this more modeling going forward?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think that the John, this is Steve, I think, it's a little bit of the long tail we had in some of the countries outside the U.S. and that's what happened. The total is still within the range that we talked about but the timing was delayed based on some local market laws and regulations.", "John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So should we see that sort of trail off now, Steve?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, I think, were -- for the most part, I think, it will be done by the end of third quarter completely but it'll be a trickle, I think, in the third quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Steve, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about, obviously, it was possible that this outcome was going to happen given the transition that was underway. I'm wondering if you could just talk about any course corrections you've made in terms of your sales organization going forward and if you've been able to implement or how to implement any changes as a result of the performance you saw in the September quarter?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "You know, Walter, I think it's -- look, we -- life is about doing things, making decisions, reflecting on them and learning as you go and continually to improve. I'm utterly convinced this was the right long-term decision for us. If I would have been more prudent in my guidance, you guys wouldn't have believed me. So we just didn't know. And we were surprised at how -- but it's isolated to new license sales. It was about the same everywhere in the world, so there was no geographic phenomenon. There was no government phenomenon, although we, like others, were a little bit less in government but that wasn't material to the results. So what we've learned is that this transition from hunters to farmers and people getting it with the new coverage model and getting specialization was -- had much more impact than we thought. And we dug a hole for ourselves, as you can see in the deferred revenue, that we have to dig our way out of. So I think this has been, on the positive side, a catalyst for us now to break down some of the barriers in the organization. And I think the team is collaborating more effectively now. And I think this is going to make us much better. It's a little painful for all of us to go through this. But in the end, we're going to be better off and I'm convinced the decisions we made are the right ones for the long-term.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just on, maybe for Drew, on the employee count. It looks like you did actually have -- you had sort of -- the flat employee base into Q1, you had an increase in Q2 -- I'm sorry another decrease into Q2. Is that employee number relatively bottomed at this point? Should we start to see that build? Just trying to get a sense of some expectation around the employee number headed for here as we come out of the restructuring?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think we've got, this is Steve again, Walter, we've got a lot of moving parts here and it's something that we're going to, obviously, take a hard look at. I mean, I think we're down 624 employees year-over-year. And so a big part of that is the management structure where we reduced 35% of our management. But it's something that we're looking hard, and we have a ramp-up as we're implementing some new IT systems. And so there's a bunch of things that are going in and out. But overall, it's something that we're very focused on. But we are investing in a bunch of areas for the long-term. And we're also finding redundancies and inefficiencies that are freeing up resources. So it's going to be a combination of investments and also reductions as we go forward. And I think that's -- we're going to manage this tightly and do the right thing for the long-term and be thoughtful about the short-term.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about -- in terms of the sales force disruption, to what degree is that just guys just figuring out their new roles and it's sort of an internal disruption, if you will, to what degree did you see a higher than expected turnover, guys leaving involuntary, departures of sales guys versus what you were expecting?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I think it's a really thoughtful observation. I mean, look, we have -- over 90% of our people in this coverage model had new responsibilities. And so I think it just takes longer. You got to go meet with customers. It takes 6 to 9 months for some of these products to build a pipeline. I think we also have -- we had a lot of people leave that were probably farmers. I heard a bunch of stories, anecdotally now, of people that interviewed with competitor -- a competitor interviewed 20 of our people and they asked them, well, are you farmers or hunters? And 1 person said, they were a hunter. So I think we've had a shift from the keeping our hunters and letting farmers go and I think that's a natural attrition and my strategy is to have stronger partner relationships and fewer higher-impact or more highly compensated hunters and then feed them these great new offerings that we have coming, both through our sales force and the channel that we think are going to give us a real advantage in the marketplace when they start hitting. So I think this is a more meta combination. It's bigger than just salespeople. I think we're going to have more compelling offerings, dramatically more compelling going forward and that'll make it easier for our salespeople to book new business. So this isn't really about salespeople. It's about giving them better solutions to sell, better channel relationships, more support and enablement. We've talked about the fact that in the past, our system was broken and our salespeople didn't spend as much time selling as -- at the industry norms. We're making progress on a lot of those fronts. We just had a big pothole here on new license sales. I think Drew said it was down about 30% year-over-year and everything else was really within normal ranges. And I think a lot of it is for the points, but new people -- or people in new territories getting into their jobs. And so, we expect to do better in Q3. We expect to do better than that in Q4 and we expect to get our head above water in -- going into fiscal year '15. Obviously, we're going to work hard to be the best we can be. But after this surprise, we want to be prudent in how long it takes to dig out of this hole.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And I could perhaps sneak in one last one. The unfortunate timing, if you will, that you guys have. This misstep where you hit this pothole, right when FireEye's coming public and they're getting a lot of visibility into how well they're growing. Any commentary on the competitive impacts of guys like FireEye in the market or maybe if we expand that a little bit further, I'm hearing more positive things about McAfee in the market as of late. So maybe go over the competitive dynamics and any impacts that, that might have had?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, look, I think this has always been a tough competitive market. And at the same time, I would tell you, there's always a lot of focus on shiny new objects. We actually just launched the shiny new object we call our \"Disarm\" technology in our new Messaging Gateway product that ships next week, that we're pretty excited about as a -- a feature that we think will be part of our suite to help customers protect themselves from APTs with a technology that we think is better in some ways than some of the other competitors, and so you'll learn more about that from us as we go forward. I think this, to be honest, is mostly self-inflected. I don't think that the competitive dynamic has changed dramatically. I hear noise like you say, I also just heard about somebody that ended a 12-year relationship with McAfee to come to Symantec. So I think you can hear noise on a lot of different things. I think in my view, the competitive dynamic hasn't changed that much. We just -- this was self-inflected wounds in the short term to win in the long term.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "Steve, with overall bookings down 17% year-on-year, can you give us a sense how much of that is disruption from the changes to the Enterprise go-to-market versus your bookings performance with Norton?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. I think that -- well, no, it's all -- the great majority of it is Enterprise. Norton is down year-over-year, but not nearly to the amount that -- and Norton was pretty much in line with expectations. So the big surprise was new licensed sales to business customers through -- directly or through the channel, which was down in the neighborhood of 30% year-over-year. That's really the driver. I mean, there's lots of things we could say to blame it on somebody else. But this was the decision I made, I believe it was the right decision, I believe it'll pay big dividends for us as we work our way out of the pothole that I created.", "Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And Steve, could you maybe just comment about the precision of your updated guidance relative to where it stood 3 months ago now that you've looked into the abyss and you've seen what we hope is the worst of the transformation. Clearly, all that you've done here was necessary and unprecedented and I'm hoping now that you've got a greater handle, you can maybe speak to the confidence you have?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "I would tell you that I have more confidence in the guidance we issued today than I did in the guidance we gave for last quarter because of the uncertainty. We don't -- to me, it should be onward and upward from here. And we said this would be -- the second quarter would be the toughest quarter, because we were making all these changes and we did the best we could and, look, we missed the low end of our range by $13 million and -- but more importantly, we missed on bookings of new license by around 30% and so I have more confidence on the guidance going forward. I -- we did the best we could in Q2, and I'm disappointed that we didn't do a better job, but we did the best we could.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, obviously, this [indiscernible] results on the Enterprises sales. I know you're going to be rolling out these changes going into Europe next quarter and then into the Asia Pacific region the following quarter. I guess, how have you, I guess, what have you learned in North America here this past quarter that you're going to be changing as you go into the next 2 big geographies?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes. I don't know, Robert, exactly what you're referring to. But we rolled out renewals in EMEA in the second quarter. And I think in some parts of APJ, the same thing. I'm not sure we're all the way there in APJ yet, but almost all the way there. So, what change, specifically, were you talking about to make sure I heard you right?", "Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I was under the impression that you're rolling out the changes on the Enterprise sale side across the geographies in a geographical rollout manner?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "No. Sorry, we bit the bullet and did almost all of it around the world in Q2. And to build on your point and that's why as we looked at, to Brad's earlier question or Walter's point, we looked at, is there a geography problem here? No. Actually, all of the geographies were within a couple percent of each other of their new license booking miss. So it was phenomenon that was not industry, geo, product. It was pretty consistent around the world, which means I was the problem. I can't blame it on any of the -- of our geo leaders. It was my guidance that underestimated the impact of these transformational changes.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Aaron Schwartz of Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "If we look sort of look forward, now that you're through this quarter, you have a number of new products coming out and I imagine we'll get sort of the product roadmaps at some point. But now that you've shifted your sales force towards hunters, how are they communicating to their new customers when there's still a lot to come on the product front?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Aaron, it's such an insightful question. Let me share probably some inside baseball here. We are working really hard. We build engineering road maps that we shared with our team in July that -- for these new roadmaps, because we never really had multiyear roadmaps to solve our most important customers' problems. We are now learning and working really hard and I'm personally involved in building the roadmaps to put in the hands of our sales team, to take to partners and customers and to share with investors or analysts or whoever. And I would expect that by the end of this month, we would have some stuff to talk with you about, that we're pretty excited about and I referred to this in my script, where I say we got to -- we have a great story. Every customer that I go out and talk to, or Francis goes out and talks to, or Stephen Gillett, is very excited or people that come into our briefing center are very excited about what they're hearing about what we're trying to do. And actually, many of them want to become development or lighthouse customers. There's again a weakness -- we haven't done as good a job as we need to, getting those tools and stories into the hands of our sales person -- people and I think that's part of the reason why we had a bit of a stall here. We are working like dogs to get our sales people the tools they need to tell this great story. And again, I think, this is part of our learning and self-inflicted wounds, in addition to the transformation of all the roles. So I think we'll get a lot better on this a lot faster. And it's all hands on deck now to make it happen.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. If I could ask a quick follow up. I mean, I know you've spent a lot of time talking about sales management and the sales force and the changes you've made there. If we talk to channel partners, it seems like there's still some changes to come, perhaps, there's maybe an evaluation period on going on right now. But what are the major things to look for? You went through the sales model. You went through some of the product front. Is there still change to come on the channel model in terms of pricing? I mean, what are some other things we should look for?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "No, I think, Aaron, another -- a very good question and we alluded to it in my script where we're going to announce our new partner program in -- at partner -- our North American partner exchange in Scottsdale in about 3 or 4 weeks. And so the net of it is going to be, in the past, we treated everybody the same and everybody sold everything. And all of our incentives were volume based. I think, net-net, you're going to see a much more -- a strategy much more aligned to having franchises of our products based on the channels' ability to sell and have the technical skills and capability to sell and service the customers and create demand. And we're going to change the economic structures to better reward and enhance the margins for the people that are -- have the ability to create demand and do a great job for customers and their commitment to us. And so this will be a big change, again, that we think is 100% the right thing to do and there'll be some transition on this too. But for the long-term, this is a very, very important part of changing our go-to-market. I think it's a huge opportunity now for us to improve our value proposition for the channel and the partners that have the kind of capabilities that we need. So we're going to be announcing more details around that in about a month.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Clearly, Enterprise licenses was a challenge this quarter, down $63 million year-over-year. But billings was also down close to $240 million. What's the delta there? What else impacted billings to the rate that it fell?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Greg, I don't -- I mean, do we know?", "Helyn Corcos", "I would say the new license is really what drove the billings weakness, right?", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, but I guess what I just -- maybe I even asked wrong, I have the licenses down $63 million year-over-year and billings down $250 million, so I just want to get the disconnect between those 2.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "That's what your model is saying?", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, let's have Helyn follow-up with you afterward. I don't -- I mean, I don't know the answer to your question. But I think revenue, overall, was down, what, 4% year-over-year. And it wasn't 100% license and the 4% is in the neighborhood of $65 million. So maybe our model and our results in your model don't match up. But we'll let her follow-up with you on that.", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "Yes, just one other element to that is, very often, along with the new license sales is new maintenance and other products, but it's the new license sales that's really the driver, the primary driver for that, Greg. There's other things attached to a deal of the license, that's only a small portion of it. We'll follow-up with you. But that's the primary activity.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Stephen, if you look at the discussion I have with investors is like you guys have, obviously, challenges on the top line because you're changing the model, but given the where Symantec was as a company, on the margin side, there's a lot you can do. If I look at the new guidance now, it looks like the margin progression is much more closely aligned with what's going on, on the revenue side. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about this when the transition takes longer than expected? Are you kind of willing to do something extra on the margins or are we really kind of closely aligned and margin goes with revenue and that's it?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, I think it's a good question. And we get new learning every quarter as we see how we perform. Look, I still believe that and I'm still 100% committed. We had a board meeting this week. I said, look, I'm still committed to the 5% growth and greater than 30% margin targets. I think we have margin opportunities here because of our hidden factories and the way we've done things and redundancies. And the big question still now is, can we drive -- how fast can we drive growth? And I think, the answer is, we're investing in the products and we're excited about those, the customer feedback is great about that. We're changing all of these elements of our go-to-market from our sales model, renewals team, partner strategy, e-business capability, all in the same year, we're making a lot of these changes. I believe they're all the right changes for the long-term. And I think we'll get volume growth. And remember, we're still in markets that are growing 8%. So we're taking a beating on the share front while we transform the company, but I think we're going to come out of training camp here and play a much better game and we're still committed to the financial numbers I've shared in January. This is a transition year, we're changing a lot of stuff. We just hit a pothole, but we're still committed to what we said in January.", "Operator", "We'll go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "As you're contemplating your guidance for next quarter and the full year, was there one of the divisions that sort of stood out from the others as far as your reduction in the guidance, whether it be Information Management or Information Security? And then also just following up on Greg's question on deferred revenue, I understand that there was miss in license and, obviously, had license vis-\u00e0-vis to maintenance, but sort of the decline in deferred seems to sort of outstrip or would just be tied to new license growth, just to double check, I mean almost going back to John's question, just to make sure there was no change in renewal rates on Enterprise side or a change in renewal rates on the Norton front and [indiscernible] change?", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "It's all new license, Phil. It's all new license. There is no change in anything else.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, Phil, if you don't mind my adding that, very often, there are other things bundled into a deal. New license is reflective of just one piece of the sales activity. There is maintenance attached to it, but there's often other products that would be a subscription or something else that would attach itself and build up that deferred. So the license is only a small percent of any individual transaction.", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "But it's the driver.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, it's a reflection of the activity.", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "If you don't get the license, you don't have to worry about all the other stuff.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Yes, that's the point. What was your first question, Phil?", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "As you contemplated the guidance for the second half, if there is one sort of subdivision that sort of stood out from others as far as the reduction? Also just one quick one, you guys talk about a 3% to 4% decline in constant currency. If rates stay the same in March, what would be the full year effect of currency?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "While you guys are thinking about that, I think the answer is, there's no big positive or negative. I think NetBackup is a great product for us. We have a new release coming that we're excited about. I think we might get some traction on that as we move through Q -- end of the fourth quarter. It's a big business for us and it's been performing well. We -- Appliance has been great. We have some good things coming there. So I think we have a great Information Management business and we have a great security business. But what we're -- but there is no pattern or anything in terms of one product versus the other, it's a general -- because we affected 90% of the people in our coverage model. So there's nothing that stuck out that's material in answer to your question about a specific products and guidance and all that. There wasn't in the second quarter and there's not factoring that into our thinking in the Q3 or Q4. We'll see if we've got -- do you know how much currency would be for the total year?", "Well, our currency adjusted was like 1.5 to...", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "Make sure we got the question right, Philip. But we expect revenue for fiscal 2014 to be down 3% to 4% in constant currency.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "[indiscernible]", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So the currency -- because you gave what your currency assumption was for December and the revenue impact for the December quarter, I was just saying if rates stay the same in March as you've assumed in December, what would be the full year effect?", "Helyn Corcos", "We can get back...", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Philip, we'll get back to you on that.", "Andrew H. Del Matto", "We have -- we'll post it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from James Wesman with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Michael Turits on for James Wesman. The backup side of the business, it sounds like Appliances were strong, Backup Exec is still challenged. Are you seeing any change in requirements of customers and in the competitive landscape on the backup side as we move towards cloud? Are we starting to see new types of competitors or are you going to market for your customers who now are having cloud requirements for backup any differently?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "It's a great question, Michael, and I just I was at a Gartner conference talking to their backup specialist, so let me give you -- his view was that for many business, they're not going to back up into the Cloud. And so he thinks that people are way over overestimating the backup. Now, what we're doing is we're going to and are building backup capabilities, whether they're on-premise or in partnership with the cloud. And so I think our backup story is NetBackup remains strong. Appliances, we had a softer quarter than we have been having. Appliances remains strong and we're still digging our way out of the self-inflicted wounds we had from Backup Exec, which we have another release coming in the next 6 months that we think will really get our head above water there. I think the market has started to change and as fewer people buy servers, you buy a server at a small business, you generally buy backup. I think the market dynamic has changed, which is why we're reinventing Information Management with some of the new offerings that we're -- we announced in January, because we want to solve a higher order problem for customers in backup. We still want to have the leading backup point solutions, but we want to focus on and have announced these higher order solutions too, like business BCP and some of the other things, the information fabric that we've been talking about recently. So I think the market is changing. I think we're making progress, but there's a lot of moving parts now and we have to get our head above water on Backup Executive to get back on the full speed track.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Steve, I've gotten a lot of questions from your investors on the sales alignment and I realize that you said the bulk of the realignment is done. But I'm curious if you could just drill into a little bit about what you actually changed for territories, quotas, if you could just give us a sense of what's changed, so we can better understand what happened a little bit behind the scenes?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Sure, sure. No, it's pretty simple. Say that, in the past, you were a salesperson, was a generalist salesperson. This happen up through Q1. And your territory was Boston or a part of Boston. Okay, what happened July 1 is you became either a Information Security or an Information Management Specialist. Then let's say the size of your account base probably doubled or your coverage territory probably doubled. But your focus narrowed. That happened to over 90% of our sales people starting in July. That's a pretty big change. And remember then in addition to that, and you're only focused on new license, where in the past, you were compensated, and the bulk of your revenue or your activity or bookings was based on renewals. So the change is you became a hunter with the new territory with a specialization in either Information Management or Information Security. That's a big change to bite all at one time.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And you've spent a lot of time in the software industry. When you think of the ramp that's typically can be a 6- to 9-month process for bringing someone new on, but given that they've been there, do you feel like a 6-month ramp is kind of what you're thinking through in terms of getting them back up to full productivity underneath the new model?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, the good news is, we're through the first 3 months. And so I think you're right. I'm hoping it's 3 to 6 more months. I think -- look, there's still a lot of uncertainty here and that's why we're prudent in our guidance. So obviously, we're going to try and do the best we can do because we believe this is the right path. I think the better job we do, the faster they will become more productive and I shared some of the things we are doing now to better enable them and give them better tools. So we're moving as fast as we can. But I think we, being prudent, I think, it's going to take another 1 or 2 quarters to get where we want to be and I think we'll be roaring -- starting to roar when we go into fiscal year '15. And so I think that's the best insight that we have now. This is a pretty massive change. And look, a bunch of you wrote about this. And so there's no surprise here. The surprise is it was bigger than we thought. But we -- and so now we're working hard to recover. And the good news is, as we get better on the sales structure settling and we have new offerings coming and we have a lot of new positive things that we think are going to help us gain additional traction too. So there's a lot of moving parts here. This is not at all about our sales team or sales execution. It's really about the transition we put, I put the sales team through and now what we can help them -- how we can help them with enablement and messaging to help them be even more successful going forward. So we have a strong sales team and they're adjusting rapidly and effectively to this, it's just a lot to digest in a short period of time.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Pat Walravens with JMP group.", "Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Steve, as I look, you have over 1,000 open positions listed on the Careers part of your website. Are you having trouble attracting the kind of talent that you want? And what's your strategy there?", "Stephen M. Bennett", "So it's a great question. This is a company with 20,000 employees. And if you just look at normal turnover for a company like this, if you looked at normal float, my guess is you went back for the last 20 years, you'd see 1,000 open headcount in a company with 20,000 employees and 10% annual turnover. So the answer is, we're getting great talent. We just actually had somebody accepted, I can't talk about publicly yet, for a very senior role in our products organization. We've hired people from Amazon, from Google. We are acquiring great people that want to sign on and help us with the mission. And then in the sales front, as we get these new offerings coming to market, I think we're going to make our sales people look even smarter than they already are, because we're going to give them these compelling must-have products that solve these important customer problems. So I think we probably have some turnover and some of that would be expected. I mean if we had people that we were paying $200,000 to $300,000 a year to be a farmer, there aren't a lot of those kind of jobs around, I don't mind paying that kind of money or even more for a great hunter. So I think we're having a natural selection here. But we are not having trouble finding talent and I think the 1,000 number you talk about is normal float for a company of our size and scope.", "Operator", "And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Stephen M. Bennett", "Well, guys, this was a surprising and disappointing quarter for me. But as I said, I believe everything we're doing, we reflect and we try and learn and adjust and course correct. And what I would tell you, I'm disappointed in the quarter, not that -- about the performance that we underestimated the impact. At the same time, I'm -- never been more confident in our ability to win in this company and based on the feedback I'm getting from our employees, from our customers and from our partners. So we've got to dig ourselves out of the ditch here, we're working hard to make that happen. I think '15 through '17, we're going to be right on track with what we've shared. It's just a little bump in the road or a big bump in the road here, because of the disappointing bookings that we had in the balance of this year. So we'll work our way through it, we'll learn from it and we'll be better and thanks for all your support and help on this in -- as we get through it. Good talking together and I'm looking forward to next quarter, where, hopefully, we have a lot better story.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss fourth quarter and year-end earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and supplemental information. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations homepage. A copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website after our call is completed.", "Participants on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's interim President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call and will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. All references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Also, billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue. I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Thomas will be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference on May 19 in Boston. We decided to push out our Financial Analyst Day to a later date, most likely after our permanent CEO is onboard. And we intend to announce our first quarter earnings on July 30.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental material posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings in the SEC and, in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 29, 2013.", "And now, I'd like to introduce our interim CEO, Mr. Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon, everyone.", "I'm pleased to report that we delivered revenue at the high end of guidance for the fourth quarter and exceeded guidance on operating margin and EPS. Two primary factors drove those results. First, we implemented the right changes to our go-to-market capabilities in fiscal '14, and we've seen improvement in year-over-year billings trends in each of the past 2 quarters, as expected. Second, we made progress reducing costs and, as a result, improved operating margin by 160 basis points, with a path of further expansion ahead.", "Building on the momentum achieved in the fourth quarter, we expect to make further progress in fiscal '15. We plan to deliver revenue growth during the second half of our fiscal year and achieve operating margin of 30% by the fourth quarter. I couldn't be more excited about our growing markets, our industry-leading products and our world-class talent. We operate the largest civilian threat intelligence network; track a vast number of threats across the Internet; and continuously collect new telemetry from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, endpoints and servers across the globe. We leverage this telemetry to provide advanced intelligence and protection for customers, and we also help customers manage more technologies with greater efficiency in any computing environment.", "However, as we look at our businesses, we see several areas where we believe Symantec can do better. We can better leverage our substantial assets in security and information management. We can exercise more discipline in how we prioritize where we invest, and we can go much further with expense management.", "In the new leadership team's first 40 days, we've taken important steps to strengthen our organization and accelerate the pace of our transformation. The increased rigor and focus we're applying to the business sets the right course for maximizing the value of our unique assets. We are focused on 5 priorities as we start fiscal '15. These include: number one, optimizing our businesses based on life cycle and growth potential; number two, prioritizing investments for growth in our enterprise businesses; number three, further reducing costs and improving efficiencies across the company; number four, rounding out our talented executive team; and number 5, continuing to return significant cash to shareholders.", "We are moving forward with these plans concurrent with our CEO search and the board and the management team are completely aligned with these priorities.", "There is substantial opportunities for us to improve our growth profile, maximize profitability, and enhance our market positioning, and I'm confident we have the right team and plans in place to achieve our objectives.", "Now, I'll spend a few minutes outlining our 5 priorities in more detail.", "Priority 1, optimizing our businesses based on life cycle and growth potential. We are methodically evaluating every product line to balance our profitability targets against our growth objectives. Some of our businesses are ideal for improving operating margin, while others are best positioned for growth. The businesses we plan to optimize for margin tend to be more mature with lower growth potential. We plan to deploy these savings and prioritize our investments against our growth objectives in Symantec's most promising areas. We believe this approach will generate better returns and improve the long-term growth profile of the company. We are applying this approach to our $650 million information availability business, which includes Storage Foundation and Cluster Server, and our $2-billion Norton business, given where these businesses are in their life cycles. These mature world-class brands have tremendous assets that we can prudently manage for the significant recurring cash streams they generate. We can also optimize them for margin expansion while we build on their market-leading positions through continuous innovation.", "We're forming a business unit for the Norton-branded products under Fran Rosch's leadership so that we can execute more efficiently on the unique characteristics of this business. We believe we can enhance the franchise value while also improving the margin and cash generation of the business through more focused leadership. For example, we're optimizing the e-commerce direct-to-consumer channel in order to expand operating margins in this highly profitable business. Additionally, our optimization initiative will also identify selected product lines to prune that don't fit either our margin or growth objectives.", "Priority #2, prioritizing investments for growth. We are prioritizing investments for growth in our Enterprise backup, Storage Management and Security businesses. With our global scale and broad set of technologies, we are uniquely positioned to address complex and rapidly evolving enterprise needs across Security and Information Management, irrespective of device or platform. We are leveraging these advantages to accelerate growth in our Enterprise businesses. Our fast-growing Enterprise businesses today include mobile, which grew 76% year-over-year, and NetBackup Appliance, where revenue grew 27% year-over-year. We are also seeing growth in Trust Services, data loss protection, Managed Security Services and in Business Critical Services.", "In backup, where we are the market leader with 30% market share and growing at a rate that has outpaced the market for the past few years, we will continue to drive innovation in NetBackup and bring to market differentiated appliances where we've got the fastest-growing backup appliance in the industry. In Storage Management, we're investing in promising technologies such as software-defined storage, object storage and disaster recovery as a service, all of which we believe will be multibillion dollar markets.", "In Security, we're expanding our focus from prevention to detection and response to solve the advanced threat detection problem in a differentiated way. This week at our users' conference, we launched a new advanced threat protection service, Symantec Managed Security Services Advanced Threat Protection, to connect Endpoint Security to third-party gateways, significantly reducing the time and cost of detecting, prioritizing and responding to security incidents. This is part of our commitment to building an effective security ecosystem for customers.", "In addition, we'll be offering an industry-leading advanced threat protection solution, which integrates protection across the gateway, email and endpoint to deliver better multitiered security. This offering includes Synapse, a new capability that integrates telemetry data across endpoints, gateways and email to reduce false positives and operating cost for customers. Since we see opportunity to invest within target areas of our Enterprise business, we shifted resource funding within our R&D budget to put more dollars behind the most promising market opportunities. As part of this, we've also canceled a few future programs on our product roadmap to focus and invest more in areas we've just identified. We will continue to invest in our industry-leading point products while delivering new, innovative and integrated solutions.", "In addition to organic investment, we will opportunistically evaluate acquisitions that strengthen our capabilities or add new capabilities that fit our strategy and growth objectives.", "Priority #3, further reducing cost and improving efficiencies. We will continue to drive operational efficiencies and reduce costs. Last year, we reduced our sales and marketing costs by more than $300 million. We've already made significant progress on this front by reorganizing the sales force, changing the roles of our direct sales reps to focus on only new business, with a specialization in selling either Information Management or Security. We've also launched our centrally-managed renewals team, which is focused on adding value by extending the customer relationship and making it easier to renew and do more business with us. Our improving billings trend is a proof point that our sales realignment is yielding results.", "We've also launched our redesigned partner program, which consolidates multiple programs under one framework and introduces performance-based incentives with more investment and fewer partners. As a testament to our progress, we were named Computer Reseller News' 5-star Partner Program winner.", "However, there is more opportunity ahead. We have begun several new initiatives to further optimize our cost structure and improve efficiencies. Some of our expense reduction initiatives include consolidation of our global footprint, our data centers and product support. We are also streamlining the way we run our businesses with initiatives to increase R&D efficiencies and sales productivity, as well as optimize the economics of our channel program. We are confident these initiatives will not only drive margin expansion but will also enable our organization to be more efficient and, therefore, support top line improvement.", "With these initiatives in process, we expect to reach our target operating margin of 30% by the end of this fiscal year.", "Priority #4, rounding out our executive team. We are now operating with a strong team of talented business and technology leaders, and we will continue to round out our executive team. As part of this effort, we are running an active search for a Chief Products Officer.", "While I'm serving as interim CEO, the board is leading an active process to find a permanent CEO. We have retained Russell Reynolds as our executive search firm. The board's ideal candidate will have the following attributes: understanding of the technology landscape, expertise growing a multiproduct business at scale and a strong record of collaborative leadership.", "Priority 5, returning significant cash to shareholders. We will continue to return significant cash to shareholders, as we've done in the past. Over the past 10 years, we've repurchased over $10 billion of our shares. In fiscal '14, we returned 90% of our free cash flow, or $918 million, to shareholders. In fiscal '15, we expect to return significant cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks at a similar level to fiscal '14. We're confident that the changes we've made to the business in fiscal '14 and the initiatives currently underway position Symantec to capitalize on market opportunities, drive growth and margin expansion and deliver sustainable shareholder value.", "Now I would like to briefly address our views on long-term growth. The company had previously guided to greater than 5% revenue growth and better than 30% operating margin by fiscal year '17. As I have just laid out, we have a clear path to achieving 30% margins by the end of fiscal '15.", "Regarding growth, we are taking actions and prioritizing investments to accelerate growth given the markets we're in and the assets we have. We expect to return to revenue growth during the second half of fiscal '15 and expect to build from there. Greater than 5% revenue growth is firmly on our roadmap, and we will provide updates on our growth trajectory and progress as we implement our initiatives.", "In conclusion, we believe we're on the right track to accelerate growth and position the company for success. By focusing on our 5 priorities, we will continue to build a stronger, more valuable Symantec in fiscal '15. We operate in growing markets, and we have significant competitive advantages and world-class brands that we can leverage as we move forward.", "Before I turn the call over to Thomas, I'd like to introduce him. We're so pleased to have Thomas join our executive team. He brings a wealth of operational and finance experience from a number of global technology companies. We're confident he will provide the strong leadership required to drive the successful transformation of the company, and he has already begun doing so. Thomas?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. I'm very pleased be speaking with you all today. I joined Symantec with a belief that this was a great opportunity to grow and improve a leading technology company. And now, 40 days into my role, I'm confident that this is the case, and I'm excited about our future prospects. I also look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and establishing an ongoing dialogue. Let's move to our results.", "We are pleased that both our new business and renewals teams drove significant improvement in fourth quarter results, as reflected in the second consecutive quarter of an improving year-over-year billings trend. We also made progress in expanding operating margin and reducing costs in fiscal '14. And we see further opportunity to streamline our operations in fiscal year '15.", "In addition, we believe the reorganization of our sales force into new and renewal teams and the redesign of our partner program will drive improved revenue and profits going forward.", "Let me provide some details on the full year '14 financial results. We delivered revenue of $6.7 billion, in the high end of our guidance; a year-over-year decline of 3% as we completed the implementation of our go-to-market changes. We reduced expenses, which drove operating margin expansion of 160 basis points in fiscal year '14 to 27.5% and exceeding guidance. Sales and marketing expense decreased more than $300 million and, as a percentage of revenue, declined from 39% to 35% in fiscal year '14.", "Now switching to the business segments. In fiscal '14, our User Productivity & Protection segment declined 3% to $2.87 billion. Strong performance in our Enterprise, Endpoint and Mobile business was offset by continued weakness in Endpoint Management. Enterprise Endpoint Protection grew mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, in line with the market. And GAAP operating margin for this business was 37%, up 3 percentage points year-over-year due to lower sales and marketing spend.", "The Information Security segment increased 1% to $1.3 billion. Continued growth in our authentication and DLP business were offset by weakness in our mail, web and data center security business. GAAP operating margin for the segment was 14% compared to 3% in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower sales and marketing expenses. The Information Management segment declined 4% to $2.5 billion. Continued growth in NetBackup was offset by weakness in our Backup Exec and information availability offerings.", "GAAP operating margin for this segment was down 4 percentage points year-over-year to 23%, partially due to growth in our lower-margin appliance and hosted businesses.", "As expected, deferred revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $3.9 billion as a result of our September quarter billing shortfall. However, the year-over-year billing trends improved for the second consecutive quarter.", "Cash flow from operating activities was down year-over-year, driven by severance payments and the impact of lower collections on billings, and totaled $1.28 billion. We returned $918 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, which was about 90% of our free cash flow during fiscal year '14. We returned a total of $480 million in cash dividends to shareholders, and we spent $500 million to repurchase 21 million shares at an average price of $23.87, reducing our common stock outstanding count by 3%.", "Symantec has $658 million remaining in the current board authorized stock repurchase plan.", "Let's turn to the fourth quarter results. Our solid fourth quarter performance was led by better results from our sales teams and expense reductions. As expected in the March quarter, revenue declined 6% to $1.65 billion, driven by the billings shortfall in the September 2013 quarter. Both year-over-year billings and license revenue growth trends improved sequentially this quarter. While license revenue declined 12% year-over-year, it improved 15 percentage points sequentially from the December quarter and 19 percentage points from the September quarter.", "Enterprise subscriptions, which excludes Norton revenue, grew 4% and accounted for 15% of total revenue. Lower customer support expenses primarily drove 40 basis points of gross margin expansion year-over-year to 84.1%. Net income of $329 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.47, up 7% year-over-year, driven by benefits from our organization's simplification initiative and reduced spending in sales, marketing and vendor services.", "Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $449 million, down year-over-year, driven by lower billings and severance payments.", "Now I'd like to review guidance for fiscal year '15. We have identified specific levers that can drive margin expansion and accelerate revenue growth. In fiscal year '15, we will increase investments in our higher-growth areas while optimizing certain businesses for operating margin. We expect operating margin to be 20 to 70 basis points higher in fiscal year '15, and we expect 30% operating margin by the fourth quarter by implementing efficiencies across the company's operations. We've created a project management office with detailed work streams to focus on the opportunities we have identified to reduce costs and improve revenue. Some of these include specific levers that will improve new businesses and new renewal productivity, consolidate our global footprint and data centers, streamline product support and optimize product pricing.", "Year-over-year billings growth is expected to return in the second quarter as we approach 1 year since reorganizing our sales force. We expect year-over-year billings to grow at a moderate rate during the second half of fiscal year '15. We also expect revenue growth to be flat for the full year compared to fiscal year '14, driven by modest revenue growth returning during the second half of the fiscal year. Revenue growth will be supported by several factors, including improved direct and renewal sales activity and early benefits from our channel programs and new product launches. We've deployed a new planning process that enabled us to align priorities in quotas and other sales resources earlier, which allows our teams to get off to a fast start in fiscal year '15.", "As a result, revenue is expected to be between $6.63 billion to $6.77 billion. Operating margin is expected to be between 27.7% to 28.2%, resulting in EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.92. We expect cash flow from operations to grow in fiscal year '15 and CapEx to remain flattish to fiscal year '14 levels.

Note that the year-ago June period was very strong since it was a standalone sales incentive quarter, encouraging a high level of sales activity ahead of the sales reorganization in July 2013. As such, for the June 14 quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion. We expect operating margin to be between 24.1% to 24.5%, resulting in EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.43. We've increased our marketing spend in the June quarter to launch our exciting new branding campaign, which supports our product and go-to-market initiatives. Based on the initiatives we are pursuing and the opportunity we see in our markets, we are confident we are on the right track to improve the potential for our business and the value for shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, Thomas. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Thomas, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about cash flow expectations for 2015? You did see a pretty significant decline in cash flow in 2014. You're looking for, generally, stabilization, it sounds like, in the business in 2015, and I'm just wondering if that should translate into stabilization in cash flow as well?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes. Very good question. Cash flow was down year-over-year in '14, primarily driven by the severance payments we had, and by a collection of billings shortfall because of the sales transformation we went through. Those were, we think, 2 onetime hits. And based on that, we would expect cash flow -- free cash flow to go up year-over-year in '15.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then just a follow-up, I guess, for both of you. You're new to the call here. Mike, you're on the board, but both of you didn't sort of own what was happening before. And the guidance you're giving here, I guess, is probably better than I was expecting and better than others were expecting for fiscal '15. And I know you -- it's built on detailed plans and so forth, but just wondering, how much room are you leaving yourselves here in the guidance? It seems like you could have guided probably 5% lower than this, and people wouldn't have been that surprised. Trying to get a sense of how you're thinking through that and how conservative or aggressive this guidance may be.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes. Let me get started and then, Mike, take over. It's a very good question. So I think we planned -- we spent the first 40, 45 days of our time here really methodically looking and going through the company in terms of opportunities, especially deploying a plan for the fiscal year that takes into account the potential that we see in the company from an asset, from a scale, from an employee engagement perspective, but also looking really in an honest and objective way in the improvements that we think we can make. And while the targets are ambitious and they are completely in the realm of the possible -- I mean, we both have significant experience in looking at things from an efficiency perspective. And I think we applied good judgment in setting the right targets, but making sure that they are achievable.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes. If I can just add, I think the key for us was making sure that we get the investments targeted to the fastest-growing opportunities. So we took this time to assess not only product line by product line, but also the R&D investments to make sure that the product lines either meet a growth objective or a margin objective. And then for our future investments, those in R&D, we really aggressively shifted within the existing R&D budget to make sure we targeted those at the most promising opportunity. So a lot of opportunities that I talked about got more investment, and a lot that I didn't talk about got less or were eliminated. So I think that the combination of the things that we talked about give us confidence that the plan is very achievable.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Michael, one of the biggest questions we all get is on the products. And I'm just curious if you could just give us your perspective on, as you look out this next year, what you see in the pipeline that you're most excited about? And I guess just from new products, we were hoping to see more around our -- say, in your user conference this week, and maybe we didn't hear everything as loud and clear as we should have. So I was wondering if you can just give us a quick update. And then I had just a quick follow-up for Thomas.", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. So we're really investing in 3 critical areas, and I'll talk briefly about each one, Backup, Storage Management and Security, probably no surprise that those would be the areas. In Backup, of course we continue to release new appliances. We want to build on that growth. As we said, we're the fastest-growing appliance company in the market, and we want to continue to build that because we've got the best integration between the software and the hardware. We have a new release of Backup Exec coming in July, and we've got a new release of Enterprise Vault coming. Moving to Storage Management, we've got our first offering of disaster recovery to the cloud, and that happens to be an offering for Microsoft. So that's called Disaster Recovery Orchestrator, and that's to the Microsoft Azure cloud. I'm also particularly excited about what we announced in Security. So there's 2 key offerings, one service and one product, and this really is taking advantage of the multiple technologies that we have to go after, signature, behavioral, heuristic technologies, so we have a multitiered protection against threats. With the service in particular, we're integrating with third parties. So third-party gateways. Check Point, Palo Alto Networks and SourceFire, which is now part of Cisco. So we're going to be able to use the information from their gateways and coordinate that with what we would get from the endpoints to provide customers with better protection. And there's 2 key technologies within that, or 2 key offerings. One is incident response. So we're going to help customers be able to respond better, not just protect them but also -- not just detect, but also protect and respond; and then managed adversary information. So one of the things that we've seen is the number of targeted attacks is way up. In fact, it's doubled from last year to this year. So we can actually help our customers understand who is driving the attacks for them, and that's very critical if you're, for example, a financial services company, who's targeting you. And then the solution coming later this year that we announced, our advanced threat protection solution really has the best correlation, we believe, out there between the content -- the telemetry content that is endpoint, mail, web and gateway. So the key to this is that a lot of products that are out there today deliver a lot of false positives, and that really doesn't help customers because you have the tremendous cost and time of responding to all those false positives. So the Synapse technology really is able to deliver a verdict of you really have a security incident you need to respond to or you don't. So we're pretty excited about those offerings.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the 300 basis points of margin improvement in the next fiscal year. I guess, with all the product components on the roadmap, you still feel like you can deliver all these new products while delivering -- improving operating margins. I think there was some concern that perhaps, should you put the margins on hold to really double down in driving innovation to the top line? But I guess the way you're messaging is that you can deliver both at this point.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes. I think that's a very good question and a very important point to make. Let me try to differentiate where we increase investment to drive growth and where we look at efficiencies in order to get in a better cost position. And most of the efficiencies across topics we drive are outside of our R&D organization. And because of that, we feel confident that we can go after both dimensions pretty much in parallel.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to keep on a similar theme of the prior 2 questions, and kind of better understand what you guys are seeing in the business that frankly your predecessor, Steve Bennett, didn't. I mean, 2.5 months ago, Steve was at our TMT conference talking about how we need to increase investment for growth and how you needed to sort of get the products in place to get that growth. So what did you guys see in particular that was so different than what Steve Bennett saw? Because frankly, a lot of guys saw him as pretty good at optimizing assets and creating efficiencies within businesses as well.", "Michael A. Brown", "I'd say, to boil it down, it's probably 2 key things. The first is we need to make more choices. There's a lot of opportunity at Symantec, so we don't see that any differently than Steve did. But we need to be smarter about the choices we make of where to invest, and this process that Thomas and I talked about, in terms of systematically looking at each product family, is telling us not only where to invest but where not to invest. And in fact, we're going to be pruning some of the product lines. I talked about some product families that don't meet our growth or margin objectives, and I also talked about products that we canceled. So we can't detail those for you here, but there's significant change within where we're investing in. And then the second is probably a more macro point, which is really focusing the growth on Enterprise. So as we talked about before, the Norton consumer business is a fantastic business for Symantec. And in fact, it shares a lot of the technology, of course, for endpoints, the same basic technology secures consumer endpoints to the Norton brand as it does the enterprise to the SEP products. And the key realization for us is, it probably doesn't make sense to invest in what we had been doing within Norton. I'll give you an example. We had made a number of investments in what I'll call, \"non-core\" to the Norton business, extending into services and other what we thought could be brand extensions, where we've not been successful. So it's time to realize that and make sure that the business is focused where it can be successful, which is providing the best premium consumer endpoint security. There's other examples within Norton of what we can do to create more efficiency, which has to do with the channel strategy, really focusing on the e-commerce or direct-to-consumer channel and not going after as heavily retail or OEM. So I guess the key difference is where we choose to invest, and we're clearly saying here, great business in the consumer Norton brand. But the growth for Symantec in the future is going to come from the Enterprise businesses.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And if I could sneak in one follow-up. In terms of the areas that you're not investing or you're optimizing, should we be expecting headcount reductions that are going to come along with that optimization? Is there going to be some type of formal restructuring to get those efficiencies?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, there's no company-wide reorganization, company-wide employment implications from this. But as you might expect, as you change investments, particularly if you're canceling a product line here and there, that could have some employment implications. But not on the scale of something that would be cross-company.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.", "Brad Alan Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "My first question is for Mike. Mike, I was hoping maybe you can share a little bit more about your progress in the search for a new CEO. And I think in the past, I heard that public company experience is one of your criteria, but yet I didn't hear you mention that in the list of criteria that you shared with us. And also, in parallel with the CEO search, can you maybe comment on what other options the board might be considering to create value?", "Michael A. Brown", "Okay, let's start with the CEO search. I think we're making some good progress on that. As we announced, we've hired Russell Reynolds as our search firm on that, and the search committee of the board has been formed and is already meeting to work on the progress there. The qualification of being a public company CEO, clearly we'd like that as part of our ideal list, but we're going to look broader than that to find the best possible candidate. So that's one of the criteria that we will look at. But as you could see, the list is broader than that. And then your question about what other options the board would be considering, the board periodically evaluates what changes in configuration might make sense for the business to create more value. And I would expect that as we go through this period, no different. We'll continue to be open minded about what we need to be looking at there.", "Brad Alan Zelnick - Macquarie Research", "And just for -- one for Thomas. Thomas, I believe you said in your prepared remarks that you expect billings to return to moderate growth in the second quarter as the comps ease. But if I look at historical revenue yield trends and I look at the full year expectation that you've set, it would imply that bookings next year would need to be up high-single digit in order to achieve the revenue guidance. So my question is what product roadmaps are in flux? And going into this year, you have a headwind from terminating the Norton-HP relationship. What should we expect to drive this kind of growth? And specifically, are you expecting a significant rebound in product and license revenue to get there?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Well, first of all, the prepared remarks talked about the second half of the year, not the second quarter, and that's a fine but important distinction. It's driven by a couple of things. As we said before, new product launches is a part of it, but also the changes we have made to the channel and channel management. And some of the work streams that we have started to target specific areas where revenue will be impacted. For example, the licensing side. For example, our pricing initiatives. So we'll see improvement coming from this direction without even having to depend on new product launches only.", "Michael A. Brown", "Brad, if I could just add, your question said that -- well, new product roadmaps are in flux. Actually, I think we've achieved more clarity around what products we really want to be investing in and what we don't. So I wouldn't expect that to impact the rate of progress as we deliver new products. In fact, my expectation is it should accelerate getting the products out. We're much more focused on which ones are the most important.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two quick ones. First, there were a lot of questions on the changes in the business, but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there in terms of business environment? I saw all the regions had relatively similar growth rates, but maybe some more granularity here? And my follow-up will be like what -- if the new CEO comes in now -- I mean, what are -- I mean, you have a kind of pretty solid plan of what you want to achieve there. What kind of flexibility does he have then?", "Michael A. Brown", "I think in terms of business environment, we saw that it was a fair business environment for the fourth quarter, with probably more strength driven by some of the emerging markets. Obviously, Asia, Latin America as an example, and tougher markets here in North America and Europe. And then Thomas gave some commentary obviously in terms of what we saw segment by segment. You want to add anything on [indiscernible]?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "No, I think the important thing to point out, independent of what happened in the market, and the market was good, is that we saw the recovery across the important trend lines, pretty much across all of our organization more or less. And I think that was an important topic to point out. With respect to the initiatives and the CEO, maybe I'll just continue and then Mike jumps in?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "So we are convinced that the steps that we are taking are right for the company from an operational perspective and very likely going to be accepted by a new CEO. This would be my comment.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, Thomas. That's exactly right. I mean, the things that we're doing, we think, makes sense to anyone coming in as CEO. The board is going to be flexible and collaborative to work with the new CEO and what they would like to see, but we see these as really foundational elements that would help us accelerate growth and continue our progress on margin. Any CEO is going to be interested in those things.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just want to focus on the topic of Enterprise. Obviously, you said that was going to be a focus going forward. And if you look at the billings growth over the past couple of quarters -- or a decline, I guess it got better this quarter, maybe you expect it to improve in the second half of this fiscal year. But when you look at the sales force, maybe give us sort of report card of sort of where you are right now with the changes? What worked? What didn't work? And what are the things you might be changing as we enter the new fiscal year?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. I think the changes we made last year were the right ones, laid the right foundations. So just to review, I think splitting the sales force into new business and renewal teams, we're very happy with that. And while it was a difficult move to make, we feel like that one is behind us. We also think the specialization, those folks calling on -- within IT, specialized on Security or specializing on Information Management is also the right call, given the breadth of the product portfolio that we have. And then the channel program changes, very important to make sure that we're a lot more focused on the channel partners that are delivering the biggest part of revenue to Symantec. So the channel program, rather than a one-size-fits-all, is really tailored for those channel partners who become certified and expert in products. And obviously, they benefit from that in terms of their economics, even though we still will be very broadly distributed by folks who don't what to go through certification like that. So I'd say all those changes are ones that we believe are the right moves, and we're glad that those are behind us at this point. As you mentioned, the billings trend, while not positive yet, is certainly a proof point that we're starting to get some traction. And I think that in -- what's in front of us this year will be much more minor changes. We'll expect that we're going to still invest in sales force productivity, which basically means tools and optimizing the performance of the sales organization. So there's still some of that work to do, but very minor compared to what we went through this past fiscal year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Maybe a follow-up question on the product side. I know you're not sort of characterizing this as a reset on the product side, but you definitely are emphasizing certain products over others. How do you ensure that your customers don't see sort of a wait-and-see approach given the transformation they went through last year and then some disruption on the sales relationship side over the summer, and now sort of a message that you're going to emphasize certain products you make, some that are -- divest other products. I mean, how do you sort of maintain that continued purchasing pattern out of your customer base?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, it's interesting because I spent some time earlier this week at our user conference. And I think one of the things that you hear from our customers is, \"You're a complex organization to do business with in terms of the number of products you have. It's difficult to understand everything that Symantec offers.\" And I think we need to simplify that, both for our field and, as we talked about, what we're doing in our products organization. So I think these changes are going to be welcome. We're taking in mind of course, when we do any pruning, what products are those that are extremely widely used and which ones have we been offering for some time that frankly are not that widely used and don't meet a margin or growth goal. So I don't view that customers will see this as a reset but a bit of simplification of what we're doing. And I think most of them will feel that that's a very positive step for us.", "Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Second question, if I could. If we look at the growth on the User Productivity segment, that sort of decelerated through the year, and that does have higher margins of all your business segments. Is the growth trajectory through the year just a timing factor for what you went through with the billings? Or are there any changes in renewal rates or anything more that you can help us out with on the User Productivity trajectory? And how much of a headwind is that for your margins next year if that continues to decelerate the way it has?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I think one of the issues with this segment is that there's very different product lines that are within the segment. So if you start with the Norton business as an example, which is categorized in this segment, you've got something that's very profitable. But obviously, the headwind there is PC unit shipments. And I wouldn't expect that, even though we've got some initiatives underway, to be able to streamline what we're doing there, improve our renewal rate as an example, simplify the number of solutions we offer through Norton from 7 down to 2 as an example. We're still going to face those headwinds, so I'm not expecting that to change. On the other hand, we've got some businesses that are growing quite nicely there. Our Endpoint business, or security for endpoint in the enterprise, is growing nicely. That was growing at single digits during the fourth quarter and has very good prospects going forward. And then Mobile is also within that segment, and it was the fastest-growing business we had, at 76% year-over-year growth. And we're -- that's one of the areas where we continue to invest and add functionality in the whole mobile workforce productivity suite that we offer. So very different businesses all in that -- or families all in that segment.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mark Grant with Goldman Sachs.", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Actually, this is Greg Dunham. I've gotten a lot of questions given the management changes and really, the changes underneath Steve over the course of the last year. There is significant changes at the operational level and concerns regarding the continuity of the business with where the business was maybe 1 year or 2 ago. Can you maybe address that concern? And specifically, given that dynamic, what kind of gives you the confidence that you can get back to accelerating growth in the back half?", "Michael A. Brown", "Greg, let me make a comment and then you can tell me if I'm on target with your questions. I think one of the issues with Steve's management was we saw too much executive turnover. So that was one of the reasons that the board felt like we needed to make a change. That's now stabilized. I don't think that we've seen that have that large an impact in terms of the business continuity going forward. Was that your question?", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I mean, in regards to when you're trying to optimize the business, if you have a lot of new people here that have only been here in the past 12 months, maybe you don't know all the -- you don't have the same level of visibility to how the business can perform necessarily going forward, and the comfort level that you have that, that kind of institutional knowledge is there, that you can access to then make the right decision.", "Michael A. Brown", "I'd say 2 things. First of all, I'm very impressed with the level of talent that I see in the company. Some of that talent is new in the last 12 months, as you say, but we have a lot of folks here at Symantec who've been here a number of years. And obviously, their additional experience with the business is very helpful as we take a look at it. I think you also wanted some commentary about the growth in revenue, second half?", "Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Well, the back half. It sounds like there's pricing from product cycle dynamics and some easier compares that give you the conference that you'll return to growth in the second half. Is that a fair assessment?", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, I think -- there's a number of factors, and you're hitting on them. I mean, one is, as we come up on the one year since we reorganized the sales force and the traction that we talked about earlier, that's going to be important. The channel program, getting that launched and rolled out is important. A number of the efficiency initiatives that we talked about are really about the top line. It's improving renewals rates, sales productivity and pricing. So we believe there's an opportunity through those to get revenue moving in the right direction without regards to the new products. But then we add to that, as I talked about before and won't repeat here, a pretty strong product pipeline also coming. So I think the combination of all those is what gives us confidence that we can both improve the margins, as we talked about, and get the company growing again.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. There's a recent article getting a lot of attention, where one of your executives has said that, \"Antivirus is dead.\" I just wanted to get your official thoughts on that. And then secondly, a clarification. You mentioned, Michael, that you're going to be pruning some product lines. I'm wondering if you're still planning on moving forward with each of the 10 new key product areas that had been previously identified. And also, if you can provide an update on the cadence of those offerings.", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. Yes. So I think one of our executives was surprised at how well that comment was covered. I think the key on the antivirus comment, which was reported as, \"Antivirus is Dead,\" is really that antivirus alone is insufficient. That might have been more accurate, and that in itself is no news. So I think as we'd all recognize, antivirus is a key part of a multilayered endpoint security approach. So signature-based antivirus, we estimate today, catches about 45% of the threats. And then you've got to add other technologies to block those other threats; behavioral, reputation-based detections. And the good news is Symantec has already, for years, included more than antivirus, both on the consumer Norton side, as well as the Enterprise Endpoint side. So an interesting perspective that certainly got widely picked up, and I think it only tells part of the story. Let's see. The 10 new offerings. So we made some progress on those integrated offerings and in fact, delivering on 3 of them here in FY '15. Mobile workforce productivity that we talked about earlier in the call, our fastest growing product family, and something that we will continue to improve the functionality of and offer as a suite. And then the 2 security offerings I would point to: the Service -- Managed Security Services that we talked about before, integrating the information from third-party gateways; and then the HEP [ph] solution that's coming later in the year. Those were all 3 of the original 10. And then you asked for any of them not going forward. I really can't comment at this point, ahead of us announcing anything on a particular product line as to what's not moving forward.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A follow-up on the sales force reorg side. Obviously, when the sales force changes were made, they were ones you said were moving the right direction, but there's a lot of disruption. Where are we in terms of recovering to your target level of productivity relative to the sales force?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I'd say, Michael, that we made a lot of progress. We're pretty pleased, both with having made those structural changes and then how people are adapting to those, meaning that people are clearly focused in a dedicated way on new business, as well as renewals. And then we also see that there's productivity left to go. So that's what -- one of the efficiency initiatives that we've identified has to do with sales productivity. And so that part is really tools. One of the things that's pretty exciting to see is that we're now able to give folks in our sales force the complete look of products, competitors, future roadmaps. That's all available to them in real time on their mobile device. So that kind of tool we never had at Symantec before. It all goes to making sure that the sales force can spend more time with customers instead of working through issues, back-office issues here at Symantec. So we're pretty pleased with that. But as I'm indicating, there's a little bit more to do both in terms of productivity, as well as fine-tuning performance. If you had to say, \"How much of the change is behind us?\" I'd certainly say a tremendous amount. I don't know whether that's 75% or 80% but...", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I could give you the classic, \"What inning are we in?\" question, if you like.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes. Let me make one more comment because I think you asked for a milestone. How do we judge progress? And getting back to positive growth, both on the billings as well as on the revenue side in the second half, I think, is an important milestone for us to reach. That shows that the productivity is getting in the right space. But without any doubt, what Mike said is true. We have more room for improvement, and this is what we will be focused on moving.", "Helyn Corcos", "Wonderful. Thank you. Gwen, I think we are done.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss First Quarter 2015 Earnings Results. By now, you should have had that opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted a presentation that complements our prepared remarks. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations homepage. A copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website after our call is completed.", "Participants on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's Interim President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call and will be available for replay via webcast on our webcast.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. All references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Also, implied billings refer to revenue plus a change in sequential deferred revenue, and we provided a trended history of this metric in our supplemental information.", "To provide more meaningful insight on Symantec's results and enhance investors' ability to compare our performance to our peers, we implemented a new non-GAAP policy which reduces the number of potential adjustments to GAAP measures. Effective in the June quarter, our non-GAAP financials were adjusted for the following items: stock-based compensation expense, charges related to amortization of intangible assets, certain other income and expense items that management considers unrelated to the company's core operations, and the associated income tax effects of these adjustments. As such, we've provided a historical compare for this change in our supplemental information for you to update prior years in your model.", "I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Thomas will be presenting at the Citi Technology Conference on September 3 in New York, and we intend to announce our second quarter earnings on November 5.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 28, 2014.", "And now I'd like to introduce our Interim CEO, Mr. Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thank you, Helyn. And good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid first quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS all meeting our guidance. We're pleased with the progress we're making on our 5 priorities that I outlined last quarter, and with the momentum that is building in our business.", "We achieved implied billings growth of 3% year-over-year and positive revenue growth ahead of our entire internal plan. Our separation of the sales force into new business and renewals teams has led to improved performance, especially in North America. In particular, our federal and renewals teams both delivered one of their best quarters ever. Our Backup Appliances, Trust Services and Data Loss Prevention businesses generated robust revenue growth. In the last 2 quarters, we've introduced nearly 2 dozen new or improved products, and we're on track to release almost 2 dozen more by fiscal year end.", "These results give us a great deal of confidence in our team's ability to execute our plan, and we're excited about the considerable opportunities Symantec has to improve our growth and profitability.", "Turning to our previously defined 5 priorities for fiscal year '15, namely: number one, managing our businesses as a portfolio and optimizing certain businesses for margin; number two, investing for growth in our enterprise businesses; number three, reducing costs and improving efficiencies through 8 initiatives; number four, attracting talent to our executive team; and number five, returning significant cash to shareholders. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the progress we've made on these.", "We've already begun operating some of our businesses for margin, which is our first priority. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we formed a new consumer group for our Norton-branded products, which is allowing us to drive even higher margin in this business, and we will begin reporting our consumer business as a separate segment next quarter. We're simplifying our offerings with the beta release of Norton Security and Norton Security with Backup, and we're streamlining our channel strategy by exiting certain high-cost and unprofitable retail markets and OEM deals.", "In addition to these cost reduction efforts, in early June, we introduced Norton Small Business, our first Norton offering for small businesses, and we're selectively pairing headcount to match a more simplified business.", "During the June quarter, we also saw strong renewals and improved business activity in our Storage Foundation and Cluster Server offerings, which is the other business we are managing for margins.", "As we discussed last quarter, we continue to work on divesting a few businesses that don't fit either our growth or margin objectives. We will provide an update when we have transactions to announce.", "Our second priority is focusing our resources on the areas where we see the most potential for meaningful growth. We continue to shift R&D dollars from our more mature businesses into areas we have prioritized for growth, which include Backup Appliances and selected Security businesses such as mobile, advance threat protection, Managed Security Services and Data Loss Prevention, or DLP.", "Our backup business performed very well during the quarter, with Backup Appliances growing 35% year-over-year. We nearly doubled the capacity of our enterprise backup appliance from 76 terabytes to 148 terabytes, allowing us to target the upper mid-market of the enterprise segment and effectively double our addressable market.", "We also released Backup Exec 2014 in early June. This offering delivers powerful, flexible and easy-to-use backup and recovery to protect the customer's physical, virtual or hybrid environment for a mixture of applications and operating systems and differentiates us from most competitors.", "In our Security business, our unique differentiator is that we track roughly 4 trillion threat indicators from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, endpoints and servers across the globe, a footprint unrivaled in the industry. The enormous volume and diversity of our data allows us to significantly reduce the number of false positives that seriously compromise the operational value of so many competitive products.", "To that end, we launched our managed Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP, service in the June quarter. By triangulating threat indicators from our Endpoint Protection and third-party network security products, this service provides more comprehensive threat detection. Early traction for our managed ATP service has been very positive, with several early adopters since its May launch.", "In June, we introduced our managed incident response service, which provides emergency on-demand service to help customers recover from a breach. Since our launch, 36 customers have engaged us to help triage live incidents.", "We'll extend our strength in Managed Security Services by launching 2 additional services in the fall. First, our managed adversary and threat intelligence service will offer customers a much deeper understanding of specific threat actors and attacks. Second, we believe we're the only company that will offer a cloud-based hands-on cybersecurity simulation that customers can access from anywhere and engage in realistic training scenarios that approximate customers' data center environment.", "As we discussed on our last call, we will also provide our Advanced Threat Protection capabilities for both protection and response in products for Endpoint, email and a threat defense gateway. The first offering in this series will be an ATP threat defense gateway that we expect to introduce by the end of this fiscal year.", "In addition to embedding our ATP solution into several of our security offerings, we're extending our market leading Data Loss Prevention capabilities as well into our Endpoint, email and data center security products. By integrating DLP functionality into these areas, we will provide customers with complete visibility, consistent policy enforcement and unified governance of their information. To that end, during the June quarter, we released DLP 12.5, which reduces the deployment footprint for customers from 5 servers to 1, lowering both deployment and maintenance costs.", "Turning to our third priority, we are focusing on 8 initiatives to drive revenue and improve cost efficiencies. While Thomas will discuss our 4 efficiency initiatives that will contribute to margin expansion during the second half of our fiscal year, I'd like to briefly describe our 4 revenue initiatives.", "Our first 2 revenue initiatives are focusing on improved -- improving new business and renewals productivity to help achieve better economics and greater coordination among the sales groups. Our third initiative, license compliance, reduces complexity for customers so they don't fall out of compliance, and we have begun to see results particularly in North America with our fourth initiative, pricing optimization, which incorporates customer feedback and market dynamics into transparent market pricing policies and more efficient selling processes. We're confident these revenue initiatives will drive top line growth in support margin expansion. We expect to build on the momentum we achieved in the June quarter during rest of fiscal year '15. We are on track to continue to grow revenue during the second half of the year and reach our operating margin target of 30% by the fourth quarter.", "Turning to the fourth priority of attracting top talent to our executive team, we made 2 key executive hires since our last call: first, we hired an Asia-Pacific and Japan sales leader, Adrian Jones, in June; and second, a Chief Human Resources Officer, Amy Cappellanti-Wolf, in July. Adrian has experience managing a $2 billion multiproduct technology business across APJ at Oracle. Amy has led various HR teams at Cisco, Walt Disney and Frito-Lay. We are excited about their experience and the energy they've already brought to the team and look forward to their continued contributions.", "Our CEO search is proceeded on schedule. The search committee has received strong inbound interest, and has a ready met with a number of highly qualified candidates. The committees is in the process of narrowing the field to a handful of executives and is vetting the finalists among those. We expect the board to be considering the finalists this month, and it's our goal to make an announcement by the end of September.", "We will continue to return significant cash to shareholders as we've done in the past, which is our fifth priority. Thomas will detail our June quarter dividend and share repurchase activities for you.", "In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made on our 5 priorities.", "Before I turn it over to Thomas, I want to take a minute to highlight our unique competitive advantages.", "In Information Management, we have the largest backup and recovery business, with 30% market share of this multibillion dollar market. We've enabled customers to purchase NetBackup as an integrated appliance, which is a high growth market. In fact, our integrated backup appliances market share group from 0% to 38%, to the #2 spot in just under 4 years. Going forward, we're moving our products to the cloud to complement the strength we already have in our cloud-based archiving business.", "In Security, our global footprint gives us access to threat indicators from 200 million endpoints, 1 billion systems, 8 billion email messages and 1.4 billion web requests a day. We also track reputations of about 4 trillion files and application. Symantec is the only company in the world that operates a civilian cyberintelligence threat network of this scale and depth.", "This volume and diversity of data and the ability to analyze it is unrivaled in the industry. This allows us to provide faster and better protection for customers through all of our product, including Endpoint Protection, data center gateways, threat gateways, mail and web gateways. Additionally, we offer a host of cybersecurity services to complement our extensive product portfolio in order to better protect our customers.", "This competitive advantage continues to yield high profile successes with customers and law enforcement. For example, it was critical in assisting major law enforcement agencies to recently catch and shut down global-scale threat operations including Dragonfly, which threatened energy grid operators and major electricity generation firms in North America and Europe; and CryptoLocker, which enabled hackers to encrypt and lock PC files to extort ransom payments. Symantec is at the leading edge of these efforts because we know more about what's happening to more systems worldwide than any other company.", "In conclusion, we had a solid quarter. We are making steady progress with our 5 priorities, one of which is our 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives. Our business is showing positive momentum, and we are confident in our revenue and margin targets for the fiscal year.", "Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our financial results and guidance.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Thank you, Mike. And good afternoon. As Mike noted, we had a solid quarter with our key financial metrics exceeding expectations. This was driven primarily by productivity improvements in both our new business and renewals team, in addition to newly launched offerings. This also marks our third consecutive quarter of an improving year-over-year implied billings trend as we posted positive implied billings growth one quarter ahead of our internal plan. We're making progress in driving our priorities and are well on our way to achieving our fiscal year revenue and margin targets.", "Now let's move to our June quarter results, which included an extra week of activity versus the normal 13 weeks. Revenue of $1.74 billion was up 2% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, our first quarter of revenue growth since we reorganized our sales force. This was driven by strength in our Backup Appliances, DLP and Trust Services businesses, as well as strong performance by our North America and federal sales teams.", "Year-over-year implied billings and enterprise subscription revenue growth improved sequentially this quarter. Implied billings was up 3% year-over-year, and our enterprise subscription, which excludes Norton revenue, grew 7% year-over-year, accounting of 16% of total revenue.", "Moving now to business segments. Our User Productivity & Protection segment was flat year-over-year at $740 million, as growth in Enterprise Endpoint Protection was offset by continued weakness in Endpoint Management. Notably, our efforts to simplify our Norton offerings and shift more resources to our direct-to-consumer channel helped drive margin expansion. GAAP operating margin for this segment was 36%, up 1 percentage point year over year.", "Next quarter, we'll begin reporting a consumer security segment and enterprise security segment and continue to report our Information Management segment.", "The Information Security segment increased 2% year-over-year to $345 million, driven by continued growth in our Trust Services and DLP businesses and offset by weakness in our mail, web and data center security businesses. We are pleased with the early traction we have seen with our MSS-ATP service and continue to invest in this business. GAAP operating margin for the segment was 20% compared to 7% in the year ago period, driven by increased revenue, and more importantly, lower sales and marketing spend.", "The Information Management segment was flat year-over-year at $650 million. Continued growth in NetBackup and Backup Appliances was offset by weakness in Backup Exec. We are pleased with our strong renewals activity in the quarter. GAAP operating margin for the segment declined 9 percentage points year-over-year to 14% due to increased appliance revenue and higher R&D and marketing spend for newly launched offerings, some of which were unique to this quarter.", "Moving to gross margin. Growth in our lower margin hosted solutions and appliance businesses drove the 30 basis point year-over-year decline in gross margin to 83.3%. Our operating expenses were 2% higher year-over-year. We increased our R&D spend while decreasing expenses in sales and marketing and G&A. This resulted in an operating margin of 24.6%. Net income of $313 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.45, up 2% year-over-year.", "We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and return a total of $229 million during the June quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $104 million was in the form of cash dividends for shareholders and $125 million was used to repurchase 6 million shares at an average share price of $20.71. We have $533 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization.", "Cash flow from operating activities totaled $293 million, down year-over-year, driven by a onetime tax deposit of $104 million related to a previous year IRS audit, offset by higher collections. We expect cash flow to be up year-over-year for fiscal '15 as we return to normal seasonality in the second half of fiscal year '15.", "Capital expenditures were $92 million, up year-over-year as we invested in our IT and cloud infrastructure. As such, we expect CapEx to be front-end loaded in fiscal year '15.", "Before I review our guidance, I'd like to discuss our 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives, which are ramping nicely and are tracking according to our plans. Last quarter, we created a project management office with detailed work streams to focus on the opportunities we have identified to reduce cost and improve revenue. Three of our revenue initiatives, which Mike discussed, pricing optimization, renewals and license compliance, contributed to our results in the last quarter. We expect 3 of our efficiency initiatives, namely optimizing our Norton business, streamlining product support and reducing our global footprint, to ramp during the second half of fiscal year '15. Along with our sales force productivity and R&D capacity improvement initiatives, we expect these initiatives to build momentum into next year. We expect to provide a more detailed update on these initiatives next quarter.", "For the September quarter, we expect revenue between $1.6 billion to $1.64 billion which is flat sequentially after normalizing for the extra week and in line with our typical seasonal trend. Implied billings is expected to grow year-over-year. We expect operating margin to increase sequentially to between 25.1% to 25.9%, resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.44.", "We are pleased with the momentum we experience in the June quarter and we are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance. We expect modest implied billings growth during the second half of fiscal year '15. And having exceeded first quarter guidance gives us even more confidence in our fiscal year target, and we expect revenue to grow year-over-year during the second half of fiscal year '15. We expect operating margin to ramp sequentially and is on target to reach 30% by the fourth quarter.", "As I mentioned earlier, our efficiency savings will ramp through fiscal year '15 and is expected to benefit operating margin during the second half of fiscal year '15. Having said that, for the fiscal year, we expect revenue in the range of $6.63 billion to $6.77 billion and operating margin between 27.7% and 28.2%, and EPS between $1.84 and $1.92.", "In conclusion, I am pleased with our solid June quarter results and with the progress we are making on our 5 priorities and our 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, Thomas. Glenn, will you please begin polling for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Thomas, I'm curious now that you've been there for a little bit, if you could just give us your perspective on the areas that you see the biggest operational areas for improvement on the cost side.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, a very good question. So as we said, we started to work on our initiatives in the previous quarter, set up a project management office that tracks really in a very detailed manner all the initiatives we have identified. On the cost saving side, there are 4 initiatives, as we said. The first one is really to optimize the Norton business from a footprint and from an offering perspective, really exiting expensive retail operations and going to a more direct-to-consumer channel. We have seen already impacts from this in the first quarter, and it's going to build momentum in the second half. So very good progress. And really I would say, on this initiative, ahead of expectations. We're using our global footprint as an initiative that has a lot of value in terms of complexity costs, but this is an initiative that will show impact towards the end of this fiscal year, and with that, also taking a lot of momentum into next fiscal year. Streamlining product support is an important initiative for us, really streamlining today a very fragmented support operations, and also not only taking costs out but also improving customer experience in this process. Also an initiative with some runway, so we'll see a positive impact from that initiative right in the second half and Norton already in the second quarter. And then it's also about increasing our R&D capacity in terms of efficiency, moving more products faster through our R&D pipeline. This is much more productivity topic, and the gains we expect to lift there are going to be reinvested in productivity and portfolio, and will not contribute so much to the margin improvements we talked about.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Two questions. First, for Thomas, you saw some changes to the margins in a couple of the segments there. You saw the Storage business deteriorate a bit and you highlight some of the drivers and you saw some improvements on the Information Security side. Can you help us understand sort of sustainably what sort of trends we should see in that business as we look at those segments -- or in those margins as we look at those segments going forward?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, a very good question. On the Information Management side, it was really driven to a large extent also by singular events. We had higher R&D marketing spend around our product releases. And to be very honest, we also digested not an insignificant amount of severance charges in this segment, and in accordance with our policy to not GAAP this out anymore, it had an impact on margin. And then last not least, our Appliance business grew significantly, and it has a lower margin and is therefore dilutive to our overall efforts. And then that's why you saw the deterioration. So I would say, most of it is a onetime effect and we should see margins stabilize in this segment moving forward. On the Security side, it was good progress from a revenue perspective. And as we said, a deferred positive effect from taking our costs down in the marketing and G&A segment.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just for Mike...", "Thomas J. Seifert", "From an improvement perspective, sustainable moving forward.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. And for Michael, just on the CEO search, it sounds like you're getting closer there. I wonder if you can provide an update. As you have kind of gone through some candidates as to what sort of background or what sort of characteristics in a CEO you're looking for as the process has gotten to this point?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. Walter, I don't think that's changed. The criteria, I'll just repeat it for you, was: number one, looking for someone that had products experience from some aspect as closely related as possible in the technology space. So that doesn't mean necessarily someone from the security or storage segments in particular, but in as closely related fields as we can get. Second would be the experience operating at a global scale multi-products business. Because, of course, that is Symantec. Third, a collaborative leadership style, which addresses the concern that we've talked about before with our previous CEO. And then fourth, and ideally, experience as a public company CEO. So that's still the criteria. We've got from the finalists, candidates that meet all of those, and we have candidates where we're looking they may not meet all of those but they might be outstanding in 1 or 2 of those. Good progress of the search, as evidenced by the fact that we're expecting to announce the choice by the end of September.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was wondering, Thomas, if you would be able to quantify the impact of the extra week on the quarter for this quarter. And then more broadly, looking to the back half of the year, should we be expecting further headcount reductions as we go through the year? Or have most of the headcount reductions been accomplished already and it's more about just more operational efficiency of how you operate the business?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, so let me start with the extra week question first. It's difficult to determine exactly how much the extra week is worth, but our best estimate at this point is that it contributed about $100 million of revenue and it was slightly accretive to margins. On the second question, we look at our business. We evaluate it for efficiencies, and we'll take the necessary measures as soon as we identify them. So I could not exclude that some paring is going to be needed once we move further along the progress of our efficiency initiatives.", "Michael A. Brown", "But I think you could say that any reductions will be driven by what we see as a better process following along those initiatives that we talked about as opposed to reductions to hit a certain target. That's not the way we're approaching this.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And if I could sneak in just one last one. In terms of how we should be thinking about the gross margins on the going forward basis, it sounds like some of the initiatives that you guys are seeing a lot of success are slightly lower gross margin businesses like the NetBackup Appliances. It sounds like you guys are seeing a lot of success with some of the Managed Services businesses. So should we be expecting lower gross margins on a go-forward basis that are offset by just even lower OpEx contribution, to make operating margins go up into the back half of the year?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "That would be too simplistic in my opinion, because the revenue initiatives that Mike mentioned are driving gross margin in a not insignificant manner. If you look at our license compliance program, if you look at our efforts to increase our renewal rates, lots of progress. But there's still some room left to get to benchmark levels. And then don't forget the pricing initiatives that we have talked about, which is not about raising prices but getting a higher net effective price in our P&L. And those are measures that are not necessarily driving costs down but just enlarging the operating margin pool.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.", "Nikolay Beliov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Thomas, you mentioned that the outperformance in the quarter was due to a combination of new business renewals and new products. Is it possible to stack [ph] rank as to the effect of this for us, please?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "I would say half and half. That's the best guess I would have at this point in time. We saw good progress on some of the initiatives that Mike mentioned, and I pointed out that we saw a 1% margin improvement year-over-year in the Norton business because of the initiatives we tried. And then we also we saw significant business momentum as Backup Appliances was up 35% year-over-year. Our Trust Services business, our DLP business was up year-over-year, and we made good -- continue to make really good progress also on smaller numbers in our mobile segment.", "Nikolay Beliov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And one question for Mike. If you can give us an update on the search for a Chief Product Officer and what type of background and skills you're looking for, for that person.", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. We're continuing to look at attracting a more talented executive team. And for this position, we're looking for someone that really is responsible for product strategy across the products. So frankly, some of the same characteristics we talked about for the CEO would also apply for the Chief Product Officer.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Stefan Putyera - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is actually Stefan sitting in for Raimo. The first one, can you talk a little bit about how you're approaching the process to divest products and maybe how you're balancing the priority between the overall impact on revenue and margin profile longer term?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure, this is something that Thomas and I looked at in the first few months as we took a look at the portfolio to say which ones are contributing to our growth goals, which would be to get back to growth that is equivalent to what's happening in the market for each segment and then which products are contributing to our margin goals; we recognize that some of our businesses are more mature and have terrific margin characteristics but are not going to be the sources of growth. We've identified what those are. And if the businesses didn't contribute to either of those, then they were a candidate for divestiture. So obviously, we can't talk about which decisions we've made because we are in the process now of figuring out what's the right disposition for those assets. But that's the process that we've undertaken.", "Stefan Putyera - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on, it appears that sales productivity...", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Maybe one addition to that answer. We don't expect any impact from those initiatives in this fiscal year. So any impact from accelerating growth because we take businesses off that are dragging us to date, that is not reflected in the guidance numbers we gave.", "Stefan Putyera - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And then if you guys could touch a little bit on sales productivity, it appears that it improved a little bit. Actually it improved significantly over the previous quarters. But can you talk a little bit about how that compares to what sales productivity was before you guys made the sales reorganization in Q2 last year, and kind of how that's tracking versus your kind of a longer-term fully ramped expectation?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. I think if we went back to the September quarter a year ago, there's been tremendous focus on the separation of the sales force into new business and renewals as well the specialization of the new business to focus either on our Security business or Information Management business. So those changes, obviously, are now well behind us. We're still doing some coverage optimization by account, but folks obviously are well into their new positions, and we're seeing the result of that because the pipeline is building for us. We see very robust pipeline as we look towards the second half of the year, especially in North America. There are several other aspects to sales force productivity, which probably have not been reported on, and that's a fact that we've made a big investment in what we call enablement, which is really giving the sales force better tools, access to realtime information about product roadmaps and competitive selling plays, so that they can have that with them at all times. So less time spent researching that within the company, given the large product breadth that we have, and more time in the field working directly with customers. And then what we have talked about, which is a very important part of productivity, is the Channel program. So we're partway through what's been a many-month enrollment with our Channel partners, and we received very positive responses from those Channel partners that we consider to be high-value as opposed to those who commoditize products. Registrations in North America from Channel partners were up 14% year-over-year, so we're pretty pleased with the progress we're seeing on our Channel program. So I'd say it's a combination of those things that make up sales force productivity.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just have a question on the headcount side, and also it sort of relates back to your expenses and just your expectations this year. We start to see headcount creep back up following the restructuring you guys had. Last Q2, it's sort of more than half, sort of, the net reductions been added back. When you look at the business, and you're talking about the operating efficiencies, I mean, how should we think about sort of headcount and sort of OpEx expectations going forward? Because obviously, on the consumer side too, you have the lower OEM fees. So how do you kind of net those 2 out and prioritize? And then just one quick follow-up to that.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, good question. So the headcount additions, about slightly more than 200, were primarily in 2 areas: in product and services, so R&D and product development; and in IT. IT is about setting up our cloud infrastructure, but also in-sourcing a certain amount of contracts that we consider rather expensive. So we will see a trade-off between internal headcount buildup and the reduction in contractors and money spent. So it's part of the initiatives to optimize our cost structure, and we'll have offset points moving forward in operating expenses.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then along those lines too, you've previously talked about sort of the 5 priority goals, revenue growth and margin expansion. When you look at new CEOs, and obviously, you have a new CFO too, I mean, how do you, I guess, sort of put the waiting there in terms of priority? Obviously, you guys wanted to do both, but where is there lower hanging fruit? Is it on the revenue side, is it on the margin side? And how would you prioritize the new CEO coming in, the focus?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I'd say we see some low-hanging fruit on both sides. That's why the initiatives are balanced between revenue and efficiency or cost. So as we've said before, the 30% operating margin is closer within reach, as we talked about achieving that before we end this fiscal year. And as you can tell from the comments that we've made, the products that are already seeing traction, the reprioritization of R&D dollars, we're very focused on getting the portfolio to be growing. We're pleased that we had the first quarter of positive revenue growth and the last 4 -- it's the first quarter we've had that, in the last 4. And we continue to make changes so that in our second half, as we've already said, we will continue to see revenue growth. So again, we see opportunity in both areas. And we're going after both aggressively.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Pat Walravens with JMP.", "Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Mike, some investors and some of the industry analysts think it's too late for Symantec to catch up in the Advanced Threat Protection area. I'm sure you disagree with that. But key points can you potentially make to respond to that?", "Michael A. Brown", "The key point that we would make has to do with our global footprint and all of the telemetry that we collect from that footprint, which is why I spent a little time in my prepared remarks talking about how big that footprint is. So the hundreds of millions of endpoints that we see, the 4 trillion threat indicators, the billions of files that we track reputations on. When you put all of that together and you're able to correlate the data that comes from a network firewall -- we're working with third parties there -- our own products and that source of telemetry, we believe we're going to have a much more comprehensive capability there. So we believe that will allow us to, as soon as the product is available and the service is available today as we're talking about, that's going to allow us to, we believe, both provide more comprehensive threat protection and reduce the number of false positives. Because one of the things that we've heard from customers is: It's great that someone has identified all of these threats, but if you identify too many of them, you overwhelm our staff so we don't know which ones to focus on. So that actually increases the possibility that you're going to be breached. So this concept of layered or tiered protection is really important. And we can offer that through a variety of technologies, ATP just being one of those, and through the products that we offer that have many of the different access or control points in an enterprise. It's definitely not too late.", "Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Great. And can you quickly address the headlines about the Chinese government? I'm not sure if you've hit that already. I just heard...", "Michael A. Brown", "I don't think we talked about that yet. There have been some media reports which as of today, for us, are unconfirmed, that we're not listed among approved vendors on the government procurement list. As you can imagine with the situation in China, just as there would be in the United States, there are many procurement lists. So there's no single list to be on. As far as we understand, there's no national ban on use of some of our products. I think I saw that in someone's blog, but that is not true. Of course, this doesn't affect our Information Management or Storage products, which is most of our business in China today. So we're going to try and get to the bottom of what is the source of this. I think we'd all recognize that this is a problem a lot of U.S. technology companies are seeing. A number have been in the headlines in recent days, this is just something we're going to have to follow up. I think maybe my last comment here would be that China is a very important growth market for us. We're going to continue to support all our customers in China and we expect it to be a source of growth for us in the future.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I'm curious. A lot of the best-of-breed security and storage vendors have been doing very well recently. I'm curious if you can give us your perspective on customer buying behavior between best-of-breed vendors and vendors like yourself that can consolidate spending.", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I think the security market is always a balance of both of those. We believe we have best-of-breed in a number of technology areas, DLP would be one example of that. In fact, our DLP product, you might know, has more market share than the next 3 competitors combined. So we bring best-of-breed, but we also have a very broad global footprint. So I think our customers find that of value. Which isn't to say that they are also not -- they're also buying some best-of-breeds for particular technologies. We're playing a bit of catch-up right now in ATP, as we've talked about. So I think you're going to continue to see that because there's continued advancement in the threats and then new technologies to combat that. We're in that game. Our competitors are in that game. So there will be some leapfrogging there. But I think overall, we're pretty pleased with the position of having a combination of best-of-breed, plus the most broad footprint.", "Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's great. And I think you commented on the federal spend this quarter. I'm curious to get your expectations embedded in your third quarter guidance for the September U.S. federal end.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "I don't want to go into specifics segment guidance. But I think we are rather pleased with the momentum we have seen in the North American markets in the first quarter and from the bookings and the pipeline information we have, which was about as robust as it has been for many, many quarters. We think that the second quarter will continue that trend.", "Michael A. Brown", "We have a new sales leader there who's really doing a terrific job, so I expect the combination of what he's able to provide -- you probably know one of our board members used to be the head of U.S. Cyber Command. So we're trying to pull together those collective contacts and leverage what he's done, our sales leader for federal, to make sure that, that continues to be a growth area for us.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from James Wesman with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "It's Michael Turits on James' line. A question, guys, on the UPP side. Is it possible to pull out the extra week and talk a little bit about performance? Because obviously, it was very strong on a sequential basis. And somewhat, those trends were positive or negative. I mean, give a little bit of detail a little bit more going forward on what your thoughts are on what to do on the consumer side?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, so I think it's safe to say that Norton is part of our UPP business. It's much more subscription-based model and therefore benefited more from the additional week than other businesses. I gave an approximate number for the overall benefit for the company. I don't want to break this further down into individual segments. But as I said, Norton benefited to a larger extent because of its business model.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a little bit more on your thoughts on how to optimize that margin going forward.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, for the Norton business, there's are a couple of different factors we think to improving the business: number one, as we've talked about, is reducing the number of our offerings even though we've expanded by this quarter offering Norton Small Business, for the core consumer, the number of offerings we expect to come down overtime to basically simplify what a user experience will be. We're increasing what we're doing with the direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel. So we're going to be spending our money there to acquire customers as we reduce what we're doing in OEM and retail and we eliminate some unprofitable geographies that we were in and unprofitable OEM deals. So in general, we'd expect that our Norton business will have very slowly declining revenue as profitability increases. On the enterprise side, that's a market that is growing in the mid-single digits. That's very comparable to what our business is growing at, and we expect that we're able to improve that business over time by incorporating new technologies. We will -- over time, as we get into the next fiscal year, incorporate Advanced Threat Protection technology and DLP, Data Loss Prevention technology, into our Endpoint solutions. So I think that's going to be a boost for our Endpoint business in the enterprise. In addition, we also expect that to leverage our mobile growth, because mobile device management capability we're also going to be providing to our Endpoint customers, which makes it that much easier for the broad footprint we have with enterprise Endpoint customers to be able to buy our mobile workforce productivity suite.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And if I can, one last question, just on license. License is still weak. It's one of the few numbers that was down more sequentially from the time or year-over-year than it had been. I mean, any thought on when that flattens out, and what are the dynamics are there?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, so you have to keep in mind on license revenue that we had a really hard compare to the year before period in which sales incentives drove a very high level of activity ahead of the sales organization. And that's the primary reason why you saw another trough. Otherwise, the progress we see, from a billings and from a pipeline perspective, is good. But on the License side, this was really a tough compare.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Michael, as you noted, you recently released Backup Exec 2014. Can you talk about your expectations from that product as well as whether you think you're perhaps getting closer to stabilization of that business?", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, we're pretty enthused about what we've seen with early feedback with Backup Exec 2014 because it gives us a much higher quality, more feature-rich version. And we believe that some of our channel sales, which is the primary channel for Backup Exec, had actually slowed in anticipation of this new release; though we're anticipating that, that will pick up now that we've released Backup Exec 2014. As you know, we just released that into the month of June, so there's only a few weeks in the quarter when that was available. So we've optimize performance over previous versions, so it's up to 100% faster backup and dedupe speeds with this. And it's also reduced administration time with what we believe is a cleaner and easier to use interface. So the combination makes it a much stronger product, much higher-quality, much faster performance.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just secondly, I guess, if you could update us on how you're thinking about M&A over the balance of fiscal '15.", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure, as we've talked about before, we do expect M&A to be part of our strategy going forward, but I wouldn't expect that to be out in front of both the CEO announcement and the discussion that we would have if you about how we view our longer-term strategy. So that means you won't see any significant M&A announcements before we're having a discussion of new leadership and strategy with you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gray Powell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I don't think we've seen an updated breakdown between the various products within each segment in about 18 months or so. And I don't want you to go into too much detail, but can you break down your revenue into sort of the main buckets? I mean, specifically those buckets that you're investing in like the Backup Appliances, mobile and DLP versus the stuff that you're optimizing and then components that are non-core. And then just broadly speaking, what is the growth rate between those components that you're investing in, the stuff that's being optimized and that which is non-core?", "Michael A. Brown", "Okay. Well, let me give that a shot. So the assets that we've talked about that we're optimizing for margins is our Norton business, and the information availability business, in particular, our Storage Foundation, Cluster Server. That business actually includes a few more products, but those are the largest once there. So those we're optimizing for margin. About 1/3 of our revenue in our last fiscal year came from growing areas where the markets are growing more than 5%: Trust Services; Backup Appliances; Managed Security Services; DLP; Enterprise Endpoints; and Mobile. And a couple of those were very fast growth. Backup Appliances and Mobile, we've already talked about. Mobile, 76% growth year-over-year. Backup Appliances I think we're going 50% year-over-year if we look at fiscal year over fiscal year comparisons. And Managed Security Services, double-digit growth. So that's where the growth areas are that we're investing in for the future. If you added ATP capability to that, you'd have a large number of the areas. There are a number of other additional areas, some of which we talked about from time-to-time, that don't account for any revenue, that could be big winners for the future. Probably it's premature to talk about those, but it's just important to note that the areas that I cover today aren't the only areas where we're making investments.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets.", "James Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "This is Jim Moore in for Dan Ives. So you mentioned a lot of strength in North America. And I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the other regions? What you're seeing there, and maybe what you're seeing if anything changed since the restructuring?", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes. North America was very strong for us and Latin America was as well. I think what we're seeing across EMEA is good. It's not quite as robust as North America. And I'd say Asia Pacific Japan is an area we see a lot of growth potential. We mentioned a new strong leader that we have in that region. So I believe that we'll be seeing more growth coming from APJ as we get into the second half. We actually had tremendous strength in India in APJ. That grew at a phenomenal rate for us. So we're pretty pleased with the overall business environment, but we have to say it's strongest for us in North America.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thank you, very much, for joining us today.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss second quarter 2015 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted a presentation that complements our prepared remarks. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations homepage. A copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website after our call is completed.", "Participants on today's call are: Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call and will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks except for statements about net income and EPS. All references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Also, implied billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue, and we've provided a trended history of this metric in our supplemental information on as-reported rates.", "I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Thomas will be presenting at the UBS Technology Conference on November 19 in San Francisco and at the NASDAQ conference on December 3 in London. And we intend to announce our third quarter earnings on February 5.", "Please note non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.", "Please refer to our cautionary statement and our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 28, 2014.", "And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thanks, Helyn. We're pleased with the progress we're making with our priorities to improve growth and operating margin and with the momentum that is building in our businesses.", "We had a solid quarter, with both operating margin and EPS exceeding guidance and with revenue coming in line with our expectations. We drove 150 basis points of operating margin expansion by driving toward an improved long-term cost structure for the company.", "Additionally, implied billings grew 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis but was down 1% due to the depreciation of the euro. We're seeing more large deals with the number of $1 million deals up 56% year-over-year.", "Both our federal and renewals teams delivered another impressive quarterly performance. In October, we announced 6 new or upgraded offerings. Some of these include: our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which delivers twice the performance capacity of previous models; enhanced Symantec Endpoint Protection, which improves our ability to stop targeted attacks and advanced persistent threats; and augmented eDiscovery, which significantly accelerates how fast customers can search and identify relevant information in a litigation process. Our margin expansion and billings momentum give us confidence we'll achieve our fiscal year guidance at our original guided exchange rate.", "In October, we announced our intention to separate Symantec into 2 publicly traded companies. A separation will allow each company to focus on its unique growth opportunities, reduce operational complexity and enhance strategic flexibility. We're pleased with the positive reaction we've received from our customers, partners and employees. I attended our North America Partner Engage Conference the week after our announcement, and the partners I spoke with there were enthusiastic about the increased focus the separation brings, as most of these partners primarily sell security products or information management products.", "Our large customers have also been very supportive of the separation as they most often work with us on buying security and information management products in different buying cycles rather than simultaneously.", "And our employees are enthused about the opportunity to be part of a more focused organization. I'm confident this separation and the strategies we outlined for each business will create significant shareholder value. These strategies complement our 5 priorities, which we will continue to use to manage our 2 businesses. Thomas will provide more details about the separation process in his remarks.", "Now I'd like to discuss the progress we've made in executing both strategies and introduce recent additions to our executive team. I'll start with security. Our unified security strategy is to apply big data-driven intelligence to prevent, detect and remediate attacks faster and better than ever before. As a reminder, this strategy has 3 elements: first, deliver a unified security platform that integrates threat information from our Symantec products and Norton endpoints; second, grow our cyber-security service capabilities; third, simplify and integrate our security product portfolio by consolidating our Norton products to one offering and by extending our Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP, and Data Loss Prevention or DLP, capabilities into more of our Enterprise products.", "For example, our release of DLP 12.5 last June, which reduces the deployment footprint for customers from 5 servers to 1, helped us accelerate revenue growth in our DLP products to 18% year-over-year.", "In a few months, we will introduce our ATP Threat Defense Gateway, our first product that takes full advantage of the intelligence from our vast threat telemetry. And it does so in 3 ways: first, this ATP appliance offers automated threat detection through the analysis of all ports and protocols at the gateway level; second, this offering provides cloud-based sandboxing capabilities and a virtualized execution environment for detonation, monitoring and analysis of malware.", "Our technology uses machine learning to observe the step-by-step behavior of potential malware and then compares this behavior against telemetry of firewalls as well as our global telemetry across Symantec's endpoint, mail and web, as well as through our managed services, providing multi-tiered production.", "Our greater scale harnesses much richer threat intelligence, reducing our rate of false positives versus those of competitive solutions; third, ATP threat defense enables customers to prioritize security events, saving time and effort. Unlike competitive solutions that alert customers each time malware enters the network, whether or not that malware poses a real danger, we flag the most critical threats.", "No other vendor integrates ATP across firewalls, endpoint, email and gateways like we do. Our threat defense gateway is only the first in a series of products that will leverage our superior telemetry to generate better protection for customers.", "Additionally, we are releasing Symantec Endpoint Security Advanced Threat Protection or SES-ATP. This new offering will help our customers detect and respond to targeted attack activity on their endpoints by correlating information in our global security intelligence repository with local data in the customer's environment.", "Our research shows that virtually all advanced persistent attacks leverage endpoint systems in order to infiltrate their target organizations. SES-ATP will be delivered as an on-premise virtual appliance and will alert organizations if they are under attack, describe the scale and scope of the attack and shut down advanced threats. We will be selling this product as an add-on capability for our large installed base of Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP customers. Our complementary threat defense gateway provides ATP protection even for customers who do not currently have SEP installed.", "Moving to cyber-security services. Our addressable market is growing at a 30% compound annual growth rate from 2013 to 2018, becoming a $10 billion market by 2018. Today, we are the only company that offers the combination of Managed Security Services, incident response, managed adversary threat intelligence and a cyber-security simulation platform.", "Let me say a few words about each. We unveiled our upgraded Security Operations Center or SOC in Sydney, Australia, which joins a global network of 4 other SOCs in the U.S., U.K., Japan and India. Our incident response service, which we launched in June, has already engaged 65 customers, nearly doubling since August.", "We launched our managed adversary threat intelligence offering in early October, which provides customers with intelligence reports on adversaries, attack vectors and incidents and campaigns in targeted industries and geographies.", "Later this fiscal year, we'll be launching a cloud-based, hands-on cyber-security simulation that customers can access from anywhere and engage in realistic training scenarios that approximate their data center environments. We believe we're the only company in the world with such an offering and have already engaged with a large European government to deliver this offering.", "Over the last 12 months, Symantec has tracked 255 data breaches that exposed a total of 656 million identities. Using telemetry provided by our Global Intelligence Network of more than 41.5 million attack sensors, our researchers partnered with international law enforcement to disrupt the advanced criminal infrastructure behind the Shylock malware, remediate infections from a Turla cyber espionage campaign and helped neutralize the advanced malware used by Hidden Lynx.", "Our Information Management vision is to help organizations harness the power of their information when they need it, wherever they need it, wherever it resides. Our Information Management strategy has 3 elements: first, innovate across our best-in-class portfolio of solutions to provide resilient and reliable foundational products for our customers; second, deliver solutions that dramatically reduce the total cost of ownership of storing, managing and deriving insights and business value from information; third, enable visibility, management and control across an organization's entire information landscape through an intelligent information fabric layer that integrates with our portfolio and third-party ecosystems.", "We continue to extend our lead in backup, particularly with our appliances. The growth of our NetBackup appliances accelerated from 35% year-over-year growth in the June quarter to 45% in the September quarter. In October, we announced our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which delivers twice the performance and capacity of prior models, making the management of information even simpler and less expensive.", "Our information availability business had double-digit billings growth, driven by robust renewal activity. With Storage Foundation, we drove better performance at a lower cost than competitors, enabling the win of a multi-million dollar deal with a large company in India. To extend our leadership in Storage Foundation, we are releasing our Smart I/O platform expansion with flexible storage sharing in December. This expansion will enable customers to drive down costs, increase performance and move into cutting-edge software-defined storage.", "Our on-premise archiving product generated double-digit billings growth, driven by the summer launch of Enterprise Vault 11. Additionally, to enable customers to move data to and from the cloud, earlier this year, we introduced Disaster Recovery Orchestrator, which enables businesses to automate and manage disaster recovery of Microsoft Windows-based applications residing on either physical or virtual machines to the Microsoft Azure cloud. In November, we will extend this capability to Amazon Web Services.", "We continue to attract leading talent to my team. We've hired Balaji Yelamanchili, who will be the General Manager of our Enterprise Security Products. He has more than 20 years of development, marketing and management experience in the software industry, and was most recently Senior Vice President for Analytics and Performance Management Products at Oracle. Balaji's analytics background will be instrumental as we leverage our unified security intelligence platform to harness more insight from our vast telemetry data.", "We've also hired a new leader of strategy and alliances, Jeff Scheel, who has more than 25 years of experience at enterprise software and security companies in executive roles at FireEye, Mandiant, ArcSight and Hewlett-Packard.", "In closing, we've made significant progress over the past 7 months. We've outlined 5 key priorities, which we will continue to use in managing both of our major businesses, Security and Information Management. Number one, we're managing our portfolio of businesses for growth and margin; number two, we're shifting R&D investment to the fastest growth areas for our future; number three, we introduced 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives to stimulate growth and expand operating margins; number four, we're attracting top talent to our executive team; and number five, we continue to return significant cash to shareholders.", "Our implied billings growth rate and the change in the trajectory from last year give us confidence that we will achieve our revenue and operating margin targets at our original fiscal '15 guided exchange rate. Achieving nearly 29% operating margin this quarter underpins our ability to improve profitability.", "We've now articulated defined strategies for our 2 major businesses and announced a separation to better realize the distinct strategies required for each to be successful. We've moved from a functional to a business unit organizational structure to improve our focus on the different roles our businesses play in the Symantec portfolio.", "The improvement in our Norton operating margin from 43% to 53% underscores the power of aligning around a business focus to make quick decisions and execute faster. We've also added 6 key executives, enhancing the capability of the management team, in the past 7 months. We will continue to move quickly in making the changes required to ensure Symantec has a more successful future, and in doing so, we will stay focused on executing to deliver for customers, employees and shareholders.", "Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to review our financial results and guidance.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Symantec delivered a solid quarter, with operating margin and earnings per share exceeding guidance and with revenue coming in line with our expectations. These results were driven by strength in Enterprise Backup, Enterprise Endpoint Protection and DLP products as well as reduced operating expenses.", "We continue to make progress on our revenue and efficiency initiatives and are well on our way to achieving our fiscal year revenue and margin targets. As you know, the U.S. dollar appreciated significantly against the euro during the September quarter, which created a headwind of $106 million to deferred revenue and $19 million to our revenue. Our implied billings on a currency-adjusted basis were up 12% year-over-year. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of an improving billings trend and our second quarter of growth.", "We posted our first quarter of license growth in 6 quarters. License revenue grew 25% year-over-year, driven by strength in Enterprise Backup and an easier compare versus the year-ago period and it was also up 8% sequentially. Renewals were up year-over-year from growth in Storage Foundation and Enterprise Backup, and Enterprise subscription grew 6% year-over-year, accounting for 16% of total revenue.", "Our federal team continued to perform above expectations. We secured a multimillion dollar renewal and multiple license deals with various agencies of the U.S. government. Our number of larger deals greater than $300,000 grew 24% to 277, with strength in the retail, financial services, telco, technology and health care sectors.", "Moving now to our business segments. As we mentioned last quarter, we realigned our reporting segments into Consumer Security, Enterprise Security and Information Management. The new reporting structure provides improved transparency into our Consumer Security segment for both management and investors, and helps us better manage our Information Management and Security businesses during the period leading up to the separation.", "In Consumer Security, we simplified our product portfolio by streamlining 9 core products into a single Norton Security offering and exited unprofitable OEM contracts. These efforts expanded operating margin 973 basis points year-over-year to 53%.", "Over the last 10 quarters, we have significantly increased operating margin, as is now evident in our new reporting structure. In response to an increase in consumer protection regulations, we made the decision to be more transparent in the way we manage automatic renewals in our Norton business. We believe this change in policy is the right thing to do for our Norton customers, and will result in greater brand loyalty.", "In the near term, these changes, however, along with our decision to exit certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements, will negatively impact revenue and billings in the Norton business over the next 4 quarters.", "Revenue in the quarter was down 6% year-over-year to $485 million. However, the net impact of higher operating margin more than offset lower revenue, resulting in a 15% year-over-year increase in operating income.", "We believe we can mitigate the revenue decline in the Norton business by improving online customer acquisitions, enhancing the customer experience, transitioning Norton to a subscription service and by providing a virus removal guarantee to customers who opt in to auto-renewal.", "Enterprise Security revenue decreased 1% year-over-year to $511 million as growth in our Endpoint Protection and DLP products were offset by weakness in Endpoint Management. GAAP operating margin reached 17% compared to 15% in the year-ago period, driven by reduced expenses.", "Information Management revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $621 million. Growth in Enterprise Backup was offset by weakness in information availability. GAAP operating margin declined to 20% compared to 24% in the year-ago period, due to an increased revenue in our lower margin appliances.", "Gross margin increased 30 basis points year-over-year to 84%, as lower royalty payments more than offset an increase in lower margin appliance revenue.", "We made significant progress reducing our operating expenses during the September quarter, which resulted in operating margins of 28.7%, 150 basis point expansion year-over-year. Net income of $332 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.48, down 6% year-over-year as the September 2013 quarter included a gain on the sale of our LifeLock investment.", "We returned a total of $229 million during the September quarter via share repurchase and dividends. $104 million was in the form of cash dividends to shareholders, and $125 million was used to repurchase 5.26 million shares at an average share price of $23.75. We have $408 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization.", "Cash flow from operating activities totaled $173 million, down 9% year-over-year due to lower collections. And capital expenditures were $107 million, up year-over-year as we invest in our IT and cloud infrastructure.", "Now I'd like to briefly discuss our 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives. We made progress on our revenue initiatives, with sales and renewals, pricing optimization and license compliance all contributing to the September quarter's results. In sales and renewals, we are putting into practice more policies and procedures of a best-in-class sales organization, including more consistent forecasting, better pipeline management, more aggressive pursuit of slipped deals and a greater focus on value selling.", "In pricing, we have established more disciplined parameters that place higher value on our products and services. In license compliance, our augmented auditing procedures are beginning to show traction.", "With our efficiency initiatives, we've seen the benefits of optimizing our Norton segment in our expanded operating margin. Reducing our total footprint, streamlining product support and improving R&D capacity will contribute to revenue growth and margin expansion in the second half of fiscal year '15.", "Before I review our guidance, I'd like to comment on our separation progress. Our philosophy is to manage each business separately, minimize disruption to our businesses, partners, customers and employees and execute a well-managed separation.", "To achieve these objectives, we have established 4 operating principles. First, we're deploying dedicated work streams to manage the separation. Second, we are leaving our go-to-market capability largely intact for the remainder of this fiscal year. The split between our new license and renewal sales teams, as well as the increase in specialization between Security and Information Management, which occurred a year ago, ensures that most of our separated go-to-market capability is already in place. Third, we're creating a process to separate contracts that pertain to both our Information Management and Security products. To that end, we established a contract separation project management organization to ensure customers are minimally impacted from the transition. We believe separating the contracts will not be problematic, and we intend to enter into intercompany agreements to address the ELAs. Fourth, to minimize costs, we are delaying the creation of a duplicative organizational structure until late in the separation process. In parallel with our separation efforts, we are carefully reviewing the 2 businesses to ensure we have a more streamlined cost structure.", "Over the next 5 quarters, we expect to incur separation cost of between $80 million and $100 million. This excludes any potential tax implications outside the U.S. and potential adviser fees payable upon the separation. We will also incur restructuring charges of between $100 million and $120 million, with about half of these costs coming in fiscal year '15.", "As a result of restructuring, we expect headcount reductions of approximately 10%. We expect to reinvest some of the savings in R&D to grow key growth offerings such as mobile, services, DLP, ATP, Backup and Backup Appliances.", "The separation is expected to accelerate these restructuring efforts and generate momentum into fiscal year '16 across our 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives. For example, we'll be able to reduce our global footprint by terminating leases and closing redundant data centers and facilities.", "We are still evaluating the capital structure and capital allocation policies of each company, and will update you as we have more details. We expect to file a preliminary Form 10 in the summer, which will provide carved-out financials and other detailed information.", "Now turning to guidance. For the December quarter at an exchange rate of $1.27, we expect revenue between $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion. We expect operating margin between 28.3% to 29.3%, resulting in EPS of $0.47 to $0.50.", "We are pleased with the momentum we have generated in the first half of fiscal year '15. As a result, we are raising our fiscal year guidance at our originally guided exchange rate of $1.38 to revenue between $6.715 billion to $6.795 billion and operating margin between 28.3% and 28.6%, resulting in EPS in the range of $1.94 and $1.99. At the originally guided exchange rate, we expect to achieve revenue growth during the second half of the fiscal year and to reach 30% operating margin by the fourth quarter.", "After adjusting for the volatile currency movements at an expected annual exchange rate of $1.31 versus our originally guided rate of $1.38, we expect fiscal year revenue to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.68 billion, operating margin between 27.4% and 27.8% and EPS between $1.88 and $1.93.", "In conclusion, I am pleased with our continued progress this quarter and the future that lies ahead of Symantec. And with that, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking our questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, Thomas. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Really wanted to focus on that license line. It grew pretty impressively year-over-year even on a constant currency basis, and I understand it was an easy comp versus last year, but it was a big number in sort of the first quarter, and multiple quarters we've seen that type of growth. Wonder if you could give us some just sort of details, as far as what's driving that? In particular, you obviously made a lot of changes just on the go-to-market strategy the past 12, 15 months. I mean, is that where we're starting to see pay off or is it specific products or is it a combination? Just more detail would be great.", "Michael A. Brown", "Philip, I'd say it's a combination of the go-to-market changes, which we've talked about for several quarters here that underpin a strengthening in the business that you can see in the implied billings trend, so I'd say that's really part of it. But I'd also say it's the strength in new products. So a number of things that we called out here, the accelerating growth in appliances, you'd have to point, number one. The improvement in DLP, so seeing that up 18% year-over-year. In addition, our flagship Endpoint Protection or SEP products are also up. User Authentication, also up. So -- NetBackup, in general, separate from appliances also increased year-over-year, that was 18% also year-over-year increase. So a lot of improvement in the product comparisons as well. Of course, we introduced 6 new products in October. So as we start to think about Q3, and we'll have introduced 40 new products that will be new or upgraded versions of existing products by the end of this fiscal year.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just one question, some detail on the consumer side. You talked about some changes to practices in auto-renewal, then it sounds like you did exit some products. Could you give us some more detail on how much impact you specifically expect to see in that business from those moves and the relative weighting of those 2 factors?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well think there's a number of headwinds that -- you could view them as headwinds, you could view them as positive changes, depending on whether you're looking at revenue or the profit impact that Thomas covered in his remarks. So as we talked about streamlining the business, it was not only the product streamlining, from going from the 9 offerings down to 1, but it's also in terms of the channel and business practice. So on the channel, as you know, we focused on online acquisition and gotten out of unprofitable OEM, retail, some activity we had going in small countries. And so taking away that unprofitable revenue obviously makes a more difficult comparison as we look at the revenue year-over-year. But improves the -- both profitability as we saw the operating margin increase to 53% and the absolute profits in the business. The renewal policy that we changed basically made it much more transparent for consumers to not be automatically renewing. What we're doing to mitigate those headwinds, which you expect the last several quarters, because the business is ratable, and it will take us 3 or 4 quarters to work through that, and have a different comparison point, are focusing on online acquisition, where we think there's more opportunity to improve the rate at which we acquire customers, and then enhancing the customer experience. We're going through what it takes to land each landing page, what it takes to come to Norton and we're also improving what we can demonstrate to customers as value they receive from Norton. So an example, when one of these large malware attacks occurs, we're highlighting that for customers if they're protected already by Norton. We think that's going to show customer there's value in subscribing to Norton versus subscribing to one of the freemium offerings that are out there. For those folks who do renew automatically, we're offering a virus removal guarantee, which means that if they do get a virus, we'll guarantee to get that removed from their system. So there's a number of things that we're doing to mitigate what we're seeing as headwinds over the next several quarters.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then just one question on the Enterprise endpoint. So that product line's been stronger, I think, many people have expected for the last a couple of quarters. Can you talk about -- is it large Enterprise, is it midsize business? Is it certain verticals? And do you think you're taking share, because I think the investor consensus is probably that, that's a no growth business, and you've been seeing some pretty good growth there.", "Michael A. Brown", "We've been pretty consistent that, that has been growing mid-single digits, which is in line with the market. I actually think this past quarter, we saw some strength to indicate we could be gaining share in that market. What we just introduced in October really improves the capability of the product. We talked about that to stop targeted attacks. And I'm very enthused about what's coming as we get to the end of this fiscal year, beginning of next fiscal year, where we're introducing Advanced Threat Protection capability, focused on the endpoint, that's SES-ATP capability's going to be very powerful.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Quick question for me, is like first of all, you talked about the new product. Can you talk a little bit about the environment that you're seeing at some -- in Europe and the U.S.? And I assume it's a new product that's in your new distribution model, and all of the sales here [ph] -- improvement in the sales performance. But what are you seeing in terms of trends there? That's my first question. And then the other question we had from a lot of investors is like, can you talk a little bit about the situation in China, and how you're working around that?", "Michael A. Brown", "So I'd say from a geography standpoint, we are seeing strength in North America relative to the other regions. But I'd say it's improving from what we saw in previous quarters, especially in APJ for us. Thomas, did you want to add something?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, we've done especially well this quarter in Latin America because of some very large deals in the financial sector and in the infrastructure sector. So overall, I would say we see the strength of the product across all of the regions and all of the important verticals, whether it's federal or public sector, financial services, health care and insurance, especially. China...", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, you asked specifically about China. What we've talked about before is the same for us today, which is most of our revenue in China is from our Information Management business. So I don't know if your question was reflecting kind of the political environment in China, where a lot of tech companies have faced some difficulty. We don't see that affecting the Information Management business.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On the restructuring that you're planning on doing, ahead of splitting the company in 2. You talked about a -- initial headcount reduction of around 10%, but then you're going to reinvest in some of, sort of those cuts. Can you help us understand sort of where the areas you're expecting to cut from initially? And maybe help us understand the magnitude of that reinvestment, maybe what the net headcount looks like after all is said and done?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, that's a very good question, so I think we have been rather transparent in how we look at our cost structure and where we think there's room to make us a leaner and more efficient organization. That's in the infrastructure cost and the footprint we have, and our benchmarks in sales and marketing and also, to a certain degree, in G&A cost are off by quite a bit. And this is where most of the restructuring is going to be targeted at. As the reinvestment goes into R&D, as we said before, into mobile, into services, in DLP and ATP and the Backup and Backup Appliances. We'll provide more clarity of how much we are going to invest when we start the new fiscal year. We are going through the product portfolios from an R&D perspective, as we speak. Where's the best ROIs, where are the good growth opportunities, and where are the opportunities for us to really deliver unique benefits to our customers across the portfolio that we have. So we will not reinvest all of the 10%, but we will reinvest a good portion of it, because the opportunities from a market perspective are just huge.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then, maybe it's been a couple of -- not too long, but a couple of weeks since you guys announced the plan to split the company into 2 parts. Can you help us -- maybe some of the feedback that you've gotten from partners and customers and what they think about the plan? What's the early reception that you guys have gotten to that strategic change?", "Michael A. Brown", "I'd say it's very positive. I was able to spend the week after the announcement, as I mentioned in the script, with our North American partners at an event we call Partner Engage. And because most of our partners frankly are already focused on either one part of the business or the other, a lot of enthusiasm for what -- working with a smaller, more focused company that can execute better. And at that event, we were able to confirm that we do not see any changes to the channel program, something we've talked about in the last couple of calls. Something we've invested a lot in, something our partners have invested a lot in, because as you'll recall, this is all about better economics for more value, meaning our partners invest with us, get certification to be able to achieve better economics through this program, so that we're working with the most valuable partners who help us sell some of the most valuable solutions in the market, versus some of the products that are frankly easier to sell, and become more commoditized. So I think there's a lot of enthusiasm from the channel partners about both the program and the momentum they're seeing on products. I think our larger customers similarly are, as we've already talked about before, they're different buying centers. They're often, even when we do a contract that spans Information Management and Security, they're buying those in different cycles. So I think from their standpoint, they view it as a positive, and don't see that there's going to be a disruption to continuing to buy from us. And they're excited about what's in the pipeline.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is Fatima Boolani on behalf of Brent Thill. I had a question along the lines of the product portfolio. As you think about investing into some of these higher growth areas, the mobile DLP and ATP, what approach are you taking to some of your older products? I mean, are there some in the portfolio that could be candidates for divestitures or discontinuation or even sunsetting?", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, and Fatima, we've talked about that before. Of course, we can't announce ahead of any transaction, but we've looked both at individual products as well as groupings of products that might make sense. So that's certainly something that is on our mind. More importantly, we're focused on where we can reinvest for the highest growth. We've talked about some of those here today. We believe DLP is a flagship product for us, something where our position is more than twice as big as the next biggest competitor. We have a similar position with Endpoint, and we're going to make that a lot more powerful, as I said, when we include ATP capabilities, so SES-ATP, and that's coming very soon. We expect to be in beta on that product by the end of this fiscal year. Services is another area, which is 1 of our 3 tenets of our strategy. Huge market. We're not a large factor there, even though our business activity is way up in services. Mobile is another opportunity for us going forward. And on the Information Management side, we see opportunities continuing with appliances, as we mentioned, our growth rates accelerated there. Continue to see growth in Backup, and we're excited about the business level of activity we're seeing with some of the new offerings we've got with older products like Storage Foundation and some of the other information availability products. It's a pretty broad spectrum of things we see to invest in.", "Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Understood. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the Information Management side of the house. The appliances and the Backup growth was pretty strong. Just curious what customers' posture is around having more of a cloud-based approach to backup and archiving. We've seen a lot of software companies pivot towards the consumption or on-demand model, so just curious if you're seeing an accelerating interest in hosted or cloud-hosted backup and recovery offering.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, I think that's a very accurate description, an accelerated interest. And that has been an interest in exploring that from many different types of customers. If you look at where the market's going, it's moving first to cloud at smaller, medium-sized businesses, not really the large enterprises. So I think that's one of the reasons why our growth continues to be strong for an on-premise solution with the largest enterprises, because that's of course, where NetBackup is strongest. So I'd say we're seeing more pressure there for competitive products to Backup Exec, as an example, than we are with NetBackup. But we continue to make progress in terms of getting our offerings to the cloud. And we talked today about some of what we're doing to be able to enable customers to move back-and-forth data to the cloud and recover from the cloud. That's what Disaster Recovery Orchestrator is all about, as an example.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to follow up on a prior question about the headwinds on the revenue side to Consumer, and whether or not you actually -- well, there may be 2 different ways of looking at it. One, if you can quantify it, since you had that big drop year-over-year, relatively speaking, on the Consumer Security side, and whether or not that we could think about that going to growth, when you come out of that in 3 to 4 quarters.", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I think after 3 or 4 quarters, what we would expect is a moderation of that trend that you see this quarter. So we've talked about in the past the fact that our Norton business, it's certainly the largest, by far, Consumer Security business. And we expect that there is an opportunity to continue to improve that. But we should expect from a revenue standpoint that it will be flat to slightly declining. So we think when we get through this period of headwinds, we should return to an environment that's more like that.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And then, when you talked about the separation cost of $80 million to $100 million, the restructuring cost of $100 million to $120 million, is it -- clarification, are those costs that are going to be non-GAAPed out, and are those accrual costs or are those cash costs? If you can break those out, it'd be helpful.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "They're going to be non-GAAPed out for sure. And they are cash for most -- they are cash, 100% of the charges.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So those are all cash charges and non-GAAPed out.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Mike, you've got one of the broadest perspectives in security spending out there. And I'm curious, as you talk to CISOs around, certainly here domestically and internationally. Do you feel that 2015 security budgets could accelerate beyond core IT? I mean, I think the assumption being a lot of the 2014 budgets were set after some of the biggest breaches occurred this year.", "Michael A. Brown", "I clearly believe that. I am following as you are, what we're reading in the headlines, the increased number of breaches we talked about in our comments today. If you remember Jamie Dimon's comments, they spent $250 million on security this past year, and he's thinking about doubling that. He's not the only CEO out there that's thinking about what is required to be able to protect a business' reputation. So I think we're going to see, not only an increase in budget but an increase in budget towards some of the more sophisticated offerings to protect customers. You're going to see that from us with these ATP offerings we talked about, and services. That's why we're so focused on services. Security is so complex, and there aren't enough qualified, trained professionals in the security operation staff to deal with that, that services presents a tremendous opportunity for us going forward. So we want to be able to provide Security, how customers want to buy it, whether that's a product, a service or a combination.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "And I think that's not only a statement for the private sector. It's also a statement for the public and for the federal customers that we have, worldwide.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matthew Niknam with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A question on Enterprise Endpoint. You talked about stronger renewals and some stronger growth on that front. Wondering if you can comment on the state of competition in that market, and whether you've seen any impacts to pricing, how pricing's been trending.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, I think the Endpoint market is one where you see competitors catch up in capability, then there's price pressure. But as new capabilities come out, that presents an opportunity for an uplift in terms of pricing. So as we described today, where we have a baseline, the biggest in terms of our Symantec Endpoint Protection because we're the leader there. As we introduce a product like SES-ATP, it's an add-on capability where you get a lot more capability to protect the endpoint. And that will be sold as an add-on. So I think you'll be able to see a potential to get more revenue from that installed base, with that enhanced capability.", "Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one clarification, just on the -- as we think about timing of the restructuring and separation-related costs, how should we expect those to hit the income statement in upcoming quarters? Just trying to get a sense of, whether we straight line or if there is more weighting towards a particular time frame.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, that's fair. So I think when we talk about the separation costs we are preparing to occur those above -- across the next 5 quarters, pretty much, in more or less a linear fashion. When we talk about restructuring, we will have pretty much 50% of those charges within this fiscal year. So most of the restructuring is going to occur in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and the first quarter of next fiscal year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Thomas, as you indicated earlier, your Consumer Security margins are now 53%. They've expanded at an especially rapid pace over the last 6 quarters. You pointed out some of the reasons why. In your view, how much more margin expansion potential do you think exists within Consumer, going forward?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Well, there's always a little room for improvement, but I think what Mike said is important. We stabilized the business from a profitability perspective. Focusing on profitability was a big task, streamlining the product portfolio and getting out of revenue engagements that are not contributing to the bottom line. So now moving forward, it's more about keeping the profitability that we have, maybe slightly improving it, but making sure that we get into a revenue and top line development that Mike has indicated.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. Then if I could just ask a follow-up to Mike. Just kind of wondering your thoughts on the recent decision to stop selling the Backup Exec 3600 appliance in the market. And just if you had any broader comments on SMB-based backup for Symantec going forward.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, that's one of the decisions that we made as we talked about before, where we're taking a look at the product line to see if something's contributing to growth, is it contributing to profit, or neither. And if a product is not contributing to either, then it's a candidate to be stopped. So we've done some of those in the past. We've done that with some things we haven't announced yet, that we stopped before they got into the market. Here's an example of one that we had to stop selling, because it doesn't make any sense for us to continue, because it's not contributing to the bottom line.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Matt Spencer in for Pat. I noticed that you added 6 key executives in the past several months. Just wanted to get you maybe to talk a little bit about where those folks came from, whether it's easier, in general, to get those types of candidates now, and what the other roles that you're looking to fill are?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure. I'm excited about each one of what these executives brings, and then the combination's really improved our capabilities. So starting with Thomas, who joined us last March as CFO. We announced just several weeks ago, John Gannon, who's leading the Information Management business as an Executive Vice President from HP. Thomas, long time at AMD, as you recall. Amy Cappellanti-Wolf, who joined us as Head of Human Resources from Silver Spring and Cisco. Jeff Scheel, who joined us recently to head up Corporate Development, aligns within Strategy, joins us from FireEye, Mandiant, HP, ArcSight before that. Adrian Jones, who heads up sales for Asia Pacific, and will be our Worldwide Leader for Security Sales. He also joins us from Oracle, HP. And we're excited about the improvements that APJ has seen since he's been on board. And then very significantly, Balaji, who will be joining us, Balaji Yelamanchili from Oracle, who'll be joining us starting next Monday, and he'll be leading our Enterprise Security Products organization. So I couldn't be more pleased with the additions we've made. In terms of whether it's easier, I think it's easier given the improved momentum, and I think having a permanent CEO has been important in the recruiting process, to be honest with you. In terms of what we're looking for, going forward, I think the team is pretty well complete at this point. We're searching right now for someone to lead our Services business as a General Manager. Such an important area for our growth in the future, and we haven't had that organized as its own business. So that's the search that's underway.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.", "Nikolay Beliov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was wondering whether you can -- you're willing to share some of your preliminary thoughts on once the company separates in 2, in Security and Storage, what will the strategies be of the new companies? And Security specifically, around network security, and in the Storage business around this latest trend in the market that instead of [ph] getting multiple backup copies and data replication copies, you have one golden image of the information and what the implication of whatever the new strategy is going to be around M&A.", "Michael A. Brown", "Okay. Well, we've talked briefly about the strategies. If you look at some of the material, I believe it's on the investor website too. On Unified Security, I'll cover it very briefly, but these are the strategies that we would expect each of the businesses to go forward with. So starting with Unified Security. It's all about building this intelligence platform that takes advantage of the threat telemetry and global footprint that we have. So that's the first thing, and that will be an area of investment for us. Second is the growth in services that we talked about. And third has to do with what we do with the product portfolio to both simplify and integrate, and the integration here is not about suites of products. It's about integrating ATP and DLP capability across more of these products at the various control points. So that's, in a nutshell, is what we're thinking about for Security. On the Information Management side, it starts with improving the foundational products that we have. We're talking about NetBackup, the Appliances, Storage Foundation. We talked about some of those improvements in the prepared remarks today. It continues with what we can do to improve total cost of ownership, which really gets to your question about the number of backup copies that are floating around enterprises, so it's really going specifically to that point. And then, it's also taking advantage of the end-to-end visibility we have of seeing the life cycle of information. And we've got a development underway that we've talked about, called Information Fabric, that will allow IT professionals to see what data they have, where it's located, how it's protected and so forth. In terms of M&A activity, I would expect that we're going to continue to be looking at where we can enhance the portfolio. We need to be selective as we look at those opportunities. So I would expect that to be complementary technologies. We don't need to buy revenue at Symantec, so we're going to continue to look at those. That is under way at this point. And so I would expect we would be able to engage in some M&A activity even before the separation is complete.", "Helyn Corcos", "So operator, I believe we're at the top of the hour, so that will be it for questions today.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call to discuss third quarter 2015 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted a presentation that complements our prepared remarks. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations homepage. A copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website after our call is completed. Participants on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call and will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks except for statements about net income and EPS. All references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Also, implied billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue, and we've provided a trended history of this metric in our supplemental information in both as-reported and at constant currency rates.", "I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Mike will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference on February 11, and we will be holding our Financial Analyst Day in New York on April 17. We intend to announce our fourth quarter earnings on May 14.", "Please note non-GAAP financial measures referenced during the call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 28, 2014.", "And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thank you, Helyn. Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operational discipline. Our employees, partners and customers are energized about our future and our momentum is accelerating. We continue to execute on our 5 key priorities, especially in managing our businesses as a portfolio, which resulted in operating margin and EPS that exceeded guidance this quarter; achieving our operating margin target of 30%; implied billings growth of 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, marking our third consecutive quarter of implied billings growth; and year-over-year deferred revenue growth for the first time in 6 quarters.", "Now I'd like to discuss the progress we've made in more detail in each of our 3 segments, starting with our Veritas business. Revenue growth in our Information Management segment accelerated to 5% year-over-year from 3% in the September quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth in NetBackup software, NetBackup Appliances and Enterprise Vault.cloud.", "Last week, we unveiled the new name of our standalone information management company, Veritas Technologies Corporation. Veritas remains a powerful brand that still has tremendous equity with our customers, partners and employees.", "The need for Information Management solutions continues to accelerate with growth in unstructured data projected to increase at 42% per year. This trend is underpinning the growth we are seeing in this business. We continue to outpace the market, with 15% year-over-year revenue growth in NetBackup software. Our NetBackup Appliances grew 22% year-over-year, driven by the October launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which delivers twice the performance and capacity of prior models, making the management of information even simpler and less expensive.", "Similarly, in archiving, we had key releases that enabled our customers to access their archived content anywhere, including on mobile devices and to archive nearly any type of content. We are gaining share in all of these markets.", "Veritas will continue to aggressively enhance its industry-leading backup and recovery, storage management, clustering, disaster recovery, archiving and eDiscovery core solutions with releases planned across all key products over the upcoming year. Those solutions will also create a foundation for new information availability and insight technologies that would help customers unlock the value of their data to help drive business productivity and profitability.", "By extending current product capabilities, leveraging IP and developing differentiated architectures, Veritas will bring next-generation solutions to market designed for the hybrid cloud throughout the upcoming year. Two examples of these solutions include the Information Map and the IT Resiliency Platform [ph] .", "First, the Information Map is a cloud-based service that provides a global view of all the information across an organization in a simple and rapidly deployed solution. The Information Map is the first application that will leverage our information fabric technology and the catalog from NetBackup, the most commonly installed backup platform in the world.", "Second, the IT Resiliency Platform [ph], due out this summer is a new business continuity software solution providing one-click application recovery automation for complex enterprise hybrid clouds. Late last year, we announced the joint partnership to also deliver this capability as the complete service offering with HP services and the HP Helion OpenStack cloud platform. Both form factors reduce business risk and expense by bringing simplicity to complex enterprise operations.", "We shared our security strategy when we announced the separation of our businesses on October 9. The 3 pillars of our unified security strategy are first, provide a unified security global analytics platform that leverages the intelligence of our enterprise and consumer offerings, augmented by third-party data, to provide secure outcomes to customers better than anyone else.", "Second, simplify our Enterprise Security Product portfolio by delivering newly developed integrated advanced threat protection and information protection. We've already simplified our Norton offerings to a single product.", "And third, grow our cyber-security service capabilities. We continue to make progress in realizing our strategy, particularly in leveraging our telemetry to deliver better threat protection for customers.", "Now let me discuss some of the progress we've made in our Consumer and Enterprise Security segments. As the largest provider of security for consumers, we continue to protect customers against increasingly sophisticated threats. As an example, we recently uncovered a 0 day vulnerability which affects several versions of Adobe Flash Player. Consumers with the latest Norton Security updates were protected against this threat.", "Our previous efforts to simplify our Norton product portfolio and exit unprofitable OEM products resulted in 1,055 basis points of year-over-year operating margin expansion. As we noted in our last earnings call, more transparency in automatic renewals in Norton, along with our decision to exit certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements, results in negative year-over-year revenue comparisons in the Norton business over the next several quarters. Norton revenue was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million. However, the net impact of eliminating unprofitable revenue and lower operating expenses more than offset lower revenue, resulting in 15% year-over-year growth in operating income.", "We believe we can mitigate the revenue declines in Norton by improving online customer acquisitions, enhancing the customer experience, transitioning Norton customers to a subscription service and by providing a virus-removal guarantee to customers who opt in to auto renewal. Since Norton revenue is ratable, we expect the next 4 quarters of year-over-year declines to be at the magnitude we are seeing today. However, the rate of decline should start to moderate as revenue compares ease after that. Throughout this period, we expect to maintain operating margins above 50%.", "Moving to our Enterprise Security segment. Today, most advanced threats exploit endpoints to steal financial data and intellectual property. With our market-leading position at the enterprise endpoint, we are well positioned to help customers counter these trends. Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP's revenue growth of 5% year-over-year underscores our continued leadership in endpoint security, the largest segment of the security market. In a moment, I will discuss how we will further extend our endpoint leadership through our upcoming advanced threat protection offerings.", "Unified Security is our name for Symantec's strategy to collect massive amounts of security-relevant telemetry from the global footprint of our products, researchers and third parties in our Global Intelligence Network. To accelerate our efforts in harnessing this telemetry and building the next-generation analytics platform, we've hired 65 engineers and data scientists from Narus, a Boeing subsidiary recognized as a leader in cybersecurity, Big Data analytics as well as acquire certain technology rights. Symantec will leverage Narus's talent and expertise in data science, Big Data analytics and machine learning to deliver on our Unified Security strategy.", "Coupled with our efforts to enhance our analytics capability, we have organically developed a highly innovative Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP solution, which consists of 3 modules. These modules cover the critical control points of network, email and endpoint.", "Our ATP network solution can scan or block malicious traffic using all of Symantec's industry-leading technologies and our new Cynic virtual execution sandbox capabilities. ATP network will correlate suspicious traffic with endpoint and email activity monitored by other Symantec products. With this product we will provide a differentiated capability in prioritizing incidents for security professionals to help them cope with the increasing number of false positives that occur with competitors' products. For example, when malware is detected on the network, a security professional will be able to see that SEP or Email Security.cloud has successfully blocked it, eliminating the need for further remediation. ATP Network will ship in the June quarter.", "ATP Email extends our Email Security.cloud offering by providing additional visibility into targeted attacks delivered via email, a common attack vector for advance threats. ATP Email will also ship in June quarter.", "ATP Endpoint will collect endpoint activity data from our SEP agents and apply machine learning algorithms for detection and prioritization of suspicious files and behaviors. ATP Endpoint compares customer-specific data with our Insight reputation global data and can submit files to Cynic to reduce false-positive and increase the confidence of detection. The security professional can then direct SEP to blacklist and eradicate these threats. ATP Endpoint will ship in the September quarter. Importantly, ATP Endpoint is not a SEP replacement but a complementary add-on product that makes customers' investment in over 100 million Symantec endpoints more valuable.", "With these ATP products, Symantec will be well positioned to address not only better protection but also detection and response. Customers will be able to purchase any of our 3 ATP components together or may leverage investments they've already made in third-party's network solutions by purchasing any of our ATP offerings separately.", "Now I'd like to touch on our information protection product family, where we're bringing 2 new cloud solutions to market. A comprehensive security solution not only keeps threats out of an organization, but it also keeps critical proprietary information in. Symantec's information protection products, including our flagship DLP offering, are the industry leaders with nearly twice the market share of our closest competitor.", "Our information protection solution will enhance advanced persistent threat detection intelligence by providing additional telemetry regarding location, access and movement of confidential information. This telemetry can then be profiled and correlated with our other products to better detect advanced threat activity. For example, in the case of a large network breach, since DLP knows which user machines actually store the most confidential information, security professionals can start at the source of greatest risk.", "We are well positioned to leverage our DLP market leadership to protect enterprise data stored in the cloud and on mobile devices. In the December quarter, we launched 2 new DLP cloud solutions: DLP for cloud email for Microsoft Office 365 Exchange and DLP for Amazon Web Services.", "Finally, I'd like to discuss our cybersecurity services which address a $10 billion market opportunity by 2018, growing at a 30% compound annual growth rate. We are the only company in the world with the breadth of cybersecurity services that includes our market-leading security monitoring services, incident response services, managed adversary threat intelligence services and security simulation services.", "In the December quarter, we launched our managed adversary and threat intelligence annual subscription service, which provides clients with advanced warning and intelligence on key threat actors and their emerging tactics, techniques and procedures. This quarter we are launching the cybersecurity simulation service, and we have already secured a large European government as a customer.", "This week, we launched our Incident Response retainer service in North America and the U.K. This service allows customers to take a more proactive approach by identifying gaps in their existing incident response programs and deploying defense capabilities in advance of a security incident to reduce the time to identification and eradication of the threat.", "As the world's largest security company monitoring 4.3 trillion global threats in real time, with more than 500 full time researchers, we continue to uncover new threats every day. We were the first to publish on Regin, identifying the advanced spying tool that displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen, exhibiting traits reminiscent of other sophisticated malware families like Stuxnet.", "We will continue to move quickly in making the changes required to ensure Symantec has a more successful future, and in doing so, we will stay focused on executing to deliver for customers, employees and shareholders.", "We look forward to outlining our business model targets for Veritas, Consumer Security and Enterprise security in more detail at our Financial Analyst Day on April 17. Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our financial results and guidance.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Both Symantec's operating margin and earnings per share exceeded guidance which drove operating margin above our 30% target. And at guided rates, we delivered revenue within our guidance range. The U.S. dollar continued to appreciate significantly against major currencies during the December quarter, creating a headwind of $60 million to our revenue and $183 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis.", "Our implied billings were up 3% year-over-year, marking our third consecutive quarter of growth. The number of large deals greater than $300,000 grew 21%, with strength in financial services, insurance and information technology. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.5 billion.", "License revenue continued its improving trend from last quarter, growing 20% year-over-year and 35% on a sequential basis. Strength in license revenue was driven by enterprise backup and appliances. Enterprise subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year, accounting for 15% of total revenue.", "Moving now to our business segments, in Consumer Security, we continue to drive operating margin higher, increasing 10.6 percentage points year-over-year to 53%. As Mike discussed, we exited certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements as well as provided greater transparency on automatic renewals, which are adversely affecting revenue and billings in Norton over the next several quarters. Revenue in the period was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million.", "Enterprise Security revenue was flat year-over-year at $509 million. Our Endpoint Protection and DLP products grew 5% and 2%, respectively. This was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management and Mail and Web Security. GAAP operating margin declined to 17% compared to 20% in the year-ago period, driven by higher support spend.", "Information Management revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $668 million. NetBackup Appliances and software generated strong year-over-year growth of 22% and 15%, respectively. Strength in NetBackup was offset by weakness in Backup Exec. GAAP operating margin improved sequentially to 25% compared to 20% last quarter but was down versus 27% in the year-ago period due to higher commissions.", "Gross margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 84.1%, driven by growth in our lower margin appliance business. We achieved an operating margin of 30.4%, 140 basis points expansion year-over-year, through a combination of pricing optimization and improved renewals processes which drove enhanced top line performance, coupled with profit improvement programs such as optimizing the Norton business.", "We incurred restructuring costs of $39 million and separation costs of $29 million during the December quarter. As we noted last quarter, we are reducing our workforce and taking steps to improve our cost structure as we prepare for the separation. We expect the remainder of these charges to occur in the March and June quarters.", "Net income of $367 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.53, up 2% year-over-year.", "Now turning to cash flow and share purchases. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $358 million, up 9% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing reductions in our cost structure. Sequentially, cash flow from operations was up 107% from $173 million.", "Capital expenditures were $101 million as we continue to build our IT and cloud infrastructure.", "We returned $229 million to shareholders during the December quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $104 million was in the form of cash dividends and $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.63. We have $283 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and continue to be committed to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program.", "Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of our revenue and cost initiatives. We reached our fiscal year target for our renewals initiatives with a greater focus on value selling and process improvement. In license compliance, we've ramped the team to conduct more than 3x the number of audits here to date than we completed in fiscal year '14. In the fourth quarter, we expect to conduct more than 10x the number of fiscal year '14 audits.", "With our cost saving initiatives, for the second consecutive quarter, we've realized the benefits of optimizing the Norton segment. We're focusing our global footprint reduction efforts to optimize our labs, data centers and location for 2 standalone companies.", "Before I review our guidance, I'd like to discuss the progress we are making to complete the separation of the Veritas and security businesses by calendar year end. We've finalized the planning phase of the separation and are advancing to the execution phase, and our separation activities remain on track. Let me review some of the important milestones that we have achieved.", "First, we've chosen Veritas Technologies Corporation as the name for the Information Management company and plan to relaunch the Veritas brand in a phased approach over the coming months.", "Second, we've named key leaders as well as sales and product personnel for both businesses. The Veritas and Symantec sales organization will be operating independently as the new fiscal year begins.", "Third, in the area of consumer and partner contracts, we've made significant progress in allocating products and services between Veritas and Symantec.", "Fourth, we have begun building an ERP solution for Veritas and are well underway towards separating IT infrastructure.", "And fifth, we've finalized key real estate decisions and made substantial progress in creating the appropriate legal entities and corporate infrastructure to separate the companies. And consequently, we're on track to make Veritas operational as a standalone company in October.", "Over the coming month, we'll complete carved-out financial statements and prepare the Form 10 to be filed with the SEC by August. At our financial analyst event, we will provide more detailed information, including financial targets for each business.", "Now turning to guidance. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we set our guidance at an exchange rate of $1.38. At that rate, we expect to achieve revenue growth year-over-year as reported and exceed our original fiscal year '15 guidance on all metrics.", "We are now providing fiscal year 2015 guidance at the weighted average exchange rate of $1.28. Using the exchange rate, we expect fiscal year '15 revenue to be between $6.515 billion and $6.575 billion, operating margin between 27.5% and 27.7% and EPS between $1.87 and $1.90.", "With the continuing strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies, we're expecting an FX headwind of approximately 5.5 percentage points to our year-over-year revenue growth in the March quarter. At an exchange rate of $1.16, we expect March quarter revenue between $1.525 billion to $1.585 billion, with operating margin between 26.5% to 27.5% resulting in EPS of $0.42 to $0.45. The company's operating margin will be lower in the March quarter compared to December quarter due to typical seasonality and the FX impact.", "In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress the team has made in better aligning our cost structure and setting the path to growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at Financial Analyst Day. And with this, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions.", "Helyn Corcos", "Thank you, Thomas. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just on the security side, I'm wondering, it feels like your endpoint business is performing well. The last time we had an update on that business, it was a big part of that security business. Can you talk about what the outlook looks like for -- you highlighted Endpoint Management, Mail and Web as drags on that business. Is there anything on your road map that you think will help to mitigate some of the declines you're seeing and can help the SEP business, which I think is the lion's share of that business, the growth there shine through?", "Michael A. Brown", "Walter, so we are continuing to improve our SEP or endpoint product, which, you're right, is the flagship of our security -- Enterprise Security portfolio. So with continued releases, we would expect to keep up with some of the trends we need to, to better protect attacks. And then I think significantly, as you referred to, the ATP series is a set of modules that are really complementary products. So ATP endpoint obviously will be a complementary product that will better protect the endpoint, but it also drives strength from the modules that we'll be selling with that. And so ATP network, for example, will be attacking a completely new market for us to better protect incoming attacks that occur over network traffic. So we're excited about the continued growth we're seeing in the endpoint product. We're going to continue to enhance that product, but the ATP solution is something that will be additive to our revenue in the Enterprise Security portfolio.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. And then Thomas, for you, on the buyback the $1 billion, I might have missed this because I was hopping around on calls. But $1 billion that you announced, you're pretty much continued the $125 million per quarter on the buyback. Should we think about that $1 billion, is it all impacting the run rate at which you buy back stock?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Not at this point. We were down to, I think, slightly above $280 million remaining in the previous authorization. That is the run rate we had that you correctly mentioned. That was not enough of a buffer. And we were rather public that we are going to continue the capital distribution policy that we have in place to date at least until the separation takes place. So this new authorization is really enabling to continue with what we have in place. And at this point in time, not a contemplation to increase the run rate.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A question for Thomas. Thomas, if you look at the improvement in margins so far, they are very impressive and you've kind of keep working on inefficiencies. And how do we have to think as we go through the year in terms of pre-and post the separation? Are there things that you can do after the separation that is kind of not possible today? Or are you kind of driving this towards optimum level and then as we have to separate the company, we just kind to have to live with the revenue growth then?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "A very good question. Of course, we think, and I think we said that before, that the momentum that is building through the initiatives and driving the organization to better focus on efficiencies, that momentum will carry into the new fiscal year and we will carry that momentum also in both entities after the split. Of course, the rate of improvement is going to slow down a bit. It's going to plateau. And we were also public saying that some of these savings we are going to reinvest, especially in the security side, on the Symantec side, we're going to reinvest some of the efficiency gains into innovation and R&D spend. So you could expect improvement beyond separation, but probably at a slower pace.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brad Zelnick with Jefferies.", "Brad Alan Zelnick - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to focus on the consumer business. Even with consumer revenues down 11%, you were able to maintain 43% operating margin, 10 points better than the prior year which is again very impressive and similar to last quarter. But last quarter, 7 of those 10 points came from a year-on-year improvement to the OEM fees that were not paid as they were in the prior year. And I'm assuming that, that's similar in this quarter. But what I'm trying to understand is for every dollar you save in OEM fees in the period you forgo multiple quarters of revenue for the unit that you didn't acquire. So what I guess I'm trying to ask is, how sustainable should we think about the margin improvement being?", "Michael A. Brown", "Brad, I think about it as being very sustainable. I mean, one of the things that you point out about the OEM placement fees is they should help pay for an ongoing stream, or you can think of it as annuity. But what you find when you look at the actual results from placing with OEMs is first of all, you're not assured that for the business they do that's not direct, for example, what they sell through retail, you can be replaced even before the consumer sees your product. And we were finding that with large retailers that many of them exert their own power to put whatever consumer protection product they would like on there depending on how they're paid. And then those in turn end up being a lower rate of renewals. So the business is driven off how well you can improve renewal rates. So rather than rely on this chain of very uncertain transaction, us, the OEM, the OEM to the retailer, the retailer to the consumer, we're choosing to focus on improving the online acquisitions, going direct to the consumer, improving the customer experience and then improving the renewal rate. That's one of the reasons why we simplified the product line and have gone to subscription service. Now it will take us a number of quarters to be able to convert most of our Norton consumers to a subscription service. But when we do that, we believe we'll have very sustainable business and really get away from the headwind we're facing right now that relates to auto renewal policy changes.", "Brad Alan Zelnick - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I appreciate that color, Michael. And just as we think about the shift to more of a subscription service on that journey, can consumer be down double digits at constant currency? I think it was down 7 this quarter. But when we put our models together, what does that trajectory look like? And again, I appreciate the backdrop. That operating income for that segment is up 15% for this quarter, which is extremely impressive and you've done a great job managing the segment.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, as we said, we expect for the next several quarters to have rates of decline that are equivalent to this magnitude, and then we would expect the compares to ease or improve so that, that trend becomes moderated. And obviously, we keep you updated as we go through that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "My question actually, I want to focus on license growth. I mean, I was looking back at my model, I think it's been over a decade since we've had 2 quarters of constant currency license growth north of 20%. And so, I guess my question is I know we have sort of an easy comp here these last couple of quarters, but you also made so many changes in the past 18 to 24 months on just the go-to-market strategy. How do you feel that those are paying off? And how do you kind of expect kind of license to the trend moving forward?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, Thomas probably will have a comment on this in a minute. But before he comments, I would just say that the license growth we're seeing is driven by some particular products, as we mentioned. So if you look at the strength that's being driven by our Enterprise NetBackup business and our Appliance business, we're both growing share in that business right now. And we're focusing more of our resources in the backup business towards the Enterprise. So, for example, on the Appliance business, we just introduced the 5330 at the end of last quarter. It doubled the capacity and performance of a previous model that was in the market. So we're really addressing a whole new market segment there. And we would expect that we'll be able to continue not only to expand that globally because it was introduced first in North America with that product, but also we'll continue to make improvements in capacity and performance. So we feel like that trend has some staying power.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Not much to add from my sight. I think we see the benefits of the go-to-market changes that have been initiated. Unfortunately, some of the progress is camouflaged or headwinded by currency topics for the time being. But the soundness [ph] of the transformation attacking some of the root causes of the underperformance in the past seem to be rather effective. And that's why we are quite content for the profits we have achieved so far.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brent Thill with UBS.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just on the network side, you guys have typically shied away with the Boeing acquisition that was at least chattered as having network monitoring capabilities. You just mentioned now you're entering ATP with network. Is this a new strategy that Symantec is no longer going to shy away from the network and you're going to make a much stronger proactive push this way going forward?", "Michael A. Brown", "Brent, I wouldn't view it as a new strategy. It's really just reflecting the fact that network traffic is an important area to understand when you're trying to analyze a threat. So if you recall, when we, several quarters ago, introduced our first ATP offering, which was managed security service ATP, it also took advantage of a partnership that we have with 3 of the next-generation firewall providers: so Cisco, Sourcefire, Palo Alto networks and Check Point. So it's not an indication that we're going into network. Don't expect us to be delivering a next-generation firewall product. But we are recognizing that adding that telemetry to what we already do in terms of understanding from the other control points like mail, email, like web, like endpoint, is an important element in understanding the whole. So we'll continue to partner there. And if we can provide a product like we're doing with ATP network that complements an investment of firewall, you could expect something like that from us.", "Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just really quickly, Michael, you mentioned north of a 50% operating margin you can maintain in the consumer business. I guess, it just blends into the next generation of endpoints you're seeing this new breed of solutions entering the market from a lot of competitors. And when you think about, clearly, there's been some inefficiencies in that business that you're addressing which is great to see. But the question I get a lot from investors is, are you putting enough in the innovation pipeline to get out with something here? So the question is just, can you continue to maintain that type of margin while blocking these next-generation vendors coming in with a new series of endpoints?", "Michael A. Brown", "One of the things that is often missed is that there's tremendous leverage between the Consumer business and the Enterprise business at the endpoint. So all of the innovations that we talk about for Enterprise endpoints are also in our Consumer product. And in fact, as consumers subscribe, they're getting more of a real time improvement in product capability. So in addition to the real time signature updates which people were getting before with products, now you actually can get improvements in the functionality rather than waiting for a renewal cycle and downloading the next version. So we're keeping consumers every bit as protected with advanced features, use of high capability analytical engines that we have and sourcing that vast telemetry that we like to talk about, that 4.3 trillion objects in real time that we're monitoring globally. So consumers are benefiting from that just as our Enterprise customers are.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to dig into the concept of the consumer subscription a little bit just to get a better understanding of what we're talking about here. I've always thought about the Norton business as at least a recurring revenue stream if not a subscription. What exactly do you mean by sort of a consumer subscription now? And is it a price increase that's going to help sort of the monetization there?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I think of it in 2 ways. So one is that we are able to keep customers protected and avoid this question of an annual renewal cycle. So this is something where we made changes to the business recently, somewhat in response to changes in consumer protection in EMEA but was rolled out worldwide. And if you think about it, every time you present the customer with a renewal opportunity, they have to make a choice, there's an opportunity for leakage in the business. If someone is a subscriber, then they maintain their subscription until they opt out. So that's what we mean by going to a subscription basis. This is the second way to think about it. A customer benefits here because we're not waiting for a renewal and a download. So that means that rather than a 1-year cycle that at the end of that period and then I download a new version, we can provide more continuous updates to the customer in terms of functionality of the capability delivered from the cloud. So it's just a more modern way of protecting consumers. They get better protection, and we think there will be a better business model that results for Norton and Symantec.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. So if you call it subscription then, you kind of -- it gets around the idea of not having to do an auto renewal anymore because a subscription could be open-ended.", "Michael A. Brown", "Right. That's right.", "Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then when we think about Symantec Endpoint Protection and some of the new functionalities coming out on ATP, you said it's going to be a separate product. Do you think -- I mean, do you foresee doing any bundling? Because I mean, we've seen a lot of new functionality come out of the endpoint and it tends to get bundled into an endpoint security suite over time. What's your confidence that this is going to be sort of an independent, sort of separate product that you'll be able to get some pricing power from versus something that over time is just going to get bundled into what is the endpoint agent?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, if I think about one way your question could be going, it's kind of how inconvenient is this for customers. And actually it's designed with customer convenience in mind because it takes a large enterprise something on the order of 2 years to implement a new endpoint protection. And that's because it needs to be qualified and tested. You not only have to replace perhaps an endpoint product with a new endpoint, but also the endpoint manager needs to be replaced at the server level. So rather than ask our customers to go through some kind of a 2-year upgrade cycle, they're able to add this complementary product of ATP endpoint and get this advanced capability while leaving their current investment in SEP leveraged. So I think that -- and of course, that will be at a different price point because this will be a separate capability that we'll be offering from what people have traditionally bought with endpoints. As it relates to future packages down the road, it would be too early to say. We'll have to see what customer feedback we get as we launch this initial ATP solution with the 3 modules. We'll certainly be looking for their feedback on what's the best way to buy security in addition to continuing to offer services for those customers that don't want to go through that process of trying to integrate products themselves, we view expanded services as another growth opportunity.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Matt Niknam from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to dig into some of the momentum that you referenced that you started as you begun separating the 2 businesses. How do you ensure this momentum continues in the face of some of the ongoing headcount reductions in the business?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, the momentum is really driven by what we're seeing -- let's start with the Veritas business -- as the opportunities that we're focused on. And so we feel like we're focused on some of the higher growth opportunities where we have real advantage. So we've talked often about NetBackup as being the premier backup product for enterprises, and we're gaining share in that right now. We're investing in improving NetBackup with more frequent releases. We would expect that to be able to continue to drive strength. Same with the Appliances which, of course, has been one of our fastest-growing businesses and we're clearly gaining share, now the #2 in that market. So I think the headcount reduction is separate. They were looking for some efficiencies and we're being smart about where we would take that headcount reduction. That doesn't get in the way of providing better products for customers, R&D or the selling motion, where we have productive territories. So I really see them as 2 different activities that we're looking very carefully at the connection between where can we get continued growth but still drive efficiencies and not slow down our progress.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes. I think it's important that we especially protect the momentum in 2 areas: on the innovation front and on the go-to-market side. On the innovation side, we hardly touched our overall R&D spend. We're putting a lot of focus into productivity measures, getting faster doing HR [ph] deployment and more efficient development processes, but we are hardly touching R&D from an overall spend perspective in order to protect the innovation momentum. On the go-to-market side, we've accelerated the separation. I've been talking about getting operational separation for the 2 entities by October. We plan to enter the new fiscal year starting April. However, with 2 separate sales organization so the sales leadership has been dedicated. The coverage models have been defined. Sales compensation and quotas have been rolled out so we can make sure that we are not impacting that momentum during the year but are in the right starting positions with the first day of the new fiscal year.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thomas brings up a good point on the go-to-market motion. So we, in fact, have increased the number of quota-carrying salespeople while bringing total sales headcount down. Leadership for each of these 2 sales forces has already been meeting to start planning FY '16 in Q1. So it's certainly our intent to have as smooth a transition as possible to the beginning of next fiscal year when we'll have those sales forces completely dedicated.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.", "Nikolay Beliov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have a question around Enterprise subscriptions. According to my calculation, it's a $1 billion business, which is very sizable compared to the standalone software, the service players and growing 3%. With customers consuming technology more the software, the service, can you remind us what pieces are in this bucket and maybe how this business can accelerate with the growth levers here?", "Michael A. Brown", "So, Nikolai, you're really asking what parts of our product line in Enterprise Security are cloud subscription?", "Nikolay Beliov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm talking about Enterprise subscriptions.", "Michael A. Brown", "Yes, so I think that's about 15% or so of our total Enterprise Security business and -- Helyn's reminding me, total revenue of Symantec, is that what you -- so thanks for the correction. And it's really the email protection. Email.cloud would be the largest product line there, largest offering.", "Nikolay Beliov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then, I also had a question on enterprise maintenance, with license recovering nicely in the last couple of quarters. Are we at the point where enterprise maintenance has turned the curve and has actually turned positive growth rate?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "I think that would be a fair description from a momentum perspective. This is one of the areas where we think we are -- we've hit the turning point.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Pat Walravens with JMP Group.", "Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you could walk us through the decision process for keeping the Veritas name. Was that a difficult decision?", "Michael A. Brown", "Sure, Pat. We sat back and looked at what is the brand equity for Veritas because that was an obvious choice to make. So we undertook some research there with customers and partners, probably no surprise to you and many of the folks who follow us, we kept the Veritas name in some of the product lines that we've had. In particular, the Storage Foundation, Cluster Server products, still very much identified with Veritas. And then we also took a look at other names that we could use. Of course, that would have cost us a lot more to be able to invest in launching another name and quickly concluded that it made sense both from the tremendous positive brand equity there was in the Veritas name, with customers, partners, employees, certainly. And that made it a very simple choice relevant to the additional costs that we would have incurred by trying to launch a new name in the marketplace.", "Operator", "And then we'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions, one product. Just on the new ATP network or sandbox product, what's the architecture of that product? Broadly, in other words, is it appliance? Is it software? Is it as a cloud component? Anything you could describe would be very helpful.", "Michael A. Brown", "Interesting enough, Michael, it's all 3 of those. So it will be an appliance. Of course, it's software loaded on that appliance. And it uses a cloud. So just in a nutshell, some of the key capabilities of that product. We will be able to, through the software, prioritize the incidents we see from the traffic that we're analyzing. That's key from a productivity standpoint, because one of the things that we've talked about before is the complex problem that security operations professionals have and they've got to look through a tremendous number of alerts and identify quickly what are false positives here and what's already been remediated. So the ATP network product, particularly in combination with our ATP endpoint product, you're going to be able to see if something you're observing is a potential attack. It's already been remediated on the endpoint. So tremendous benefit by looking at these capabilities together and then the ability to prioritize these incidents is a tremendous productivity improvement. Delivered from the cloud will be something we call Cynic that I referenced in my earlier remarks. So this is the virtual execution engine, the sandbox capability. And we believe this will be certainly best-in-class because we are now able to prevent attacks from what we're calling malware-aware threats. So the threats, or the malware has become more sophisticated in evolving to know if it's in a sandbox. We've got a way around that to force it to expose itself so that we can detonate that. And then of course, also delivered from the cloud is the correlation with that telemetry data that we have. So we'll be able to -- that's a capability we call Synapse so we'll be able to see what are you seeing on the network and how does that correlate with our 4.3 million threats that we are monitoring. So on appliance, obviously using software and definitely utilizing cloud capability.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "But the virtual execution engine or sandbox was in the cloud?", "Michael A. Brown", "That's right.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And then I just had a question for Thomas. Anything that you can do to help us out on the direction for cash flow this year? You did $1.3 billion in cash off of ops from last year. I think we have been expecting that the cash impact from restructuring to be about $100 million this year. So it makes sense to think of it as kind of $100 million down from last year.", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Yes, unfortunately, yes. So I think I said this on the last call. We understand this year is a bit messy and we'll think for the Analyst Day whether we finally get to a point where we provide cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis. But we will have more impacts than just separation and restructuring impacts. We also said that in order to move our business model, we have to see some increased INT as infrastructure spend to consolidate sites, to consolidate data centers. And then we have some onetimes, especially this quarter, on the cash flow side, not so much from the separation but with respect to tax payments. So we ended this quarter at $358 million. For the fourth quarter, we will be up probably 20% including all the separation and restructuring charges.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Up 20% sequentially or year-over-year in the fourth quarter?", "Thomas J. Seifert", "Sequentially.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Aaron Schwartz with Macquarie.", "Aaron Schwartz - Macquarie Research", "Just had one question on the Enterprise Security business. That business on a constant currency basis was flat on an easier comp arguably in a pretty strong spending environment. Can you either walk through or is there something that you're seeing in bookings that's a little different than what you called out on the revenue? Or does that business just have a couple products that are going to be naturally a drag here in the near term and you're really dependent on some of these newer, more innovative products to come out to see some sustainable growth there?", "Michael A. Brown", "Aaron, I think both of what you said are true. We have some products that are not growing that we called out here. But we're seeing in terms of the business activity, significant improvements that lead us to believe that in FY '16, our next fiscal year, we'll definitely see growth from the Enterprise Security segment. And in particular, we're excited about the ATP products because those are additional revenue coming from new products that provide complementary capabilities. Our DLP business continues to grow. We're twice as big as the next competitor there. We've seen that grow in the last couple of quarters and we continue to add some new capabilities to make sure that we have the best DLP capability out there. We talked in my earlier remarks about 2 new cloud offerings that we're having there, or are going to be introducing this quarter, I should say. So I am confident we're going to see some growth from enterprise security in FY '16.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. There seems to be a debate kind of among IT buyers about the advantages between point solutions and a congruent full suite. And as you guys are working here to kind of grow the product portfolio, how is that helping when you're having these customer conversations compared to smaller vendors in areas like email and APT and backup, for instance?", "Michael A. Brown", "Well, I think there's kind of 2 concepts that you're talking about. One is the advantage of suites and the other is size of vendor. So I'll just talk about size of vendor first. I think it's a tremendous advantage to be able to supply customers, not only with a range of products but also the support that's required and the benefit of a historical ongoing relationship. So I think as it relates to size of vendor, if we can provide something that is competitive in the marketplace I think we have an advantage versus the many small companies, startups out there, even though they've got something that could be interesting. It's very complex to be integrating all of these point solutions. So I'd say that if there's something that truly offers incredible advantage, the largest enterprise customers are going to be willing to take a look at that. But even they have to be selective and it takes up a lot of their resources to be able to understand all these products and integrate them. So we should have an advantage at Symantec given our size and scale. One of the things that we're banking on, as you can tell from our strategy, is taking advantage of all that threat telemetry. So it's not just the technology capability but what do we see out there in terms of the threats and how can we make our customers smarter. We've already got some interesting proof points of customers being able to see more about what's going on and protect themselves better by taking advantage of that vast threat telemetry that we offer. That's why we think the ATP solutions are going to be so powerful in the marketplace.", "Helyn Corcos", "Operator, I see we are at the top of the hour, so that would be our last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Brown for any closing remarks.", "Michael A. Brown", "Thank you very much for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you at our Financial Analyst Day in New York on April 17.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Helyn Corcos, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Helyn Corcos - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings results.", "By now you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted a presentation that complements our prepared remarks. If you have not reviewed these documents, you can find them on the Investor Relations Events page. A copy of today's prepared remarks will be available on the website after our call is completed.", "Speakers on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for a replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Implied billings refer to revenue plus change in sequential deferred revenue and we include a trended history of this metric in our supplemental information. Also, we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. For fiscal year 2016, year-over-year growth rates exclude the impact of the extra week in the year-ago June 2014 quarter and adjust for foreign currency.", "I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Thomas will be presenting at the JPMorgan Conference on May 19 and Mike will be presenting at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Conference on June 3. We intend to announce our first quarter earnings on August 6.", "Please note non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. Lastly, today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations, speaks only as of the current date and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You'll also find a detailed discussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 28, 2014.", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mr. Mike Brown. Go ahead Mike.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2015 was a transformative year for Symantec as we improved our profitability and laid the foundation for future growth. We focused on returning to growth and right-sizing our cost structure, achieved our profitability targets, and returned significant cash to shareholders while preparing for the separation. We increased our R&D spending and shifted R&D dollars to focus on growth areas, delivering 41 Enterprise Security products and 17 Veritas products in fiscal 2015.", "In the March quarter, Symantec achieved revenue growth for the first time in three quarters. Our confidence that this momentum will continue is underscored by leading indicators such as implied billings and deferred revenue. For the full year, implied billings increased 4% and grew in every quarter. In addition, deferred revenue grew 1% for the year and posted two consecutive quarters of growth.", "Now, let's review some key highlights for each segment starting with Information Management. Exponential data growth continues due to the increased use of mobile, virtualization, and hybrid cloud technology. These trends are creating opportunity for Veritas. At Veritas, we continue to make progress on our plan to accelerate growth and expand operating margin. Veritas returned to growth in fiscal 2015 with revenue up 4% year-over-year and expanding operating margin from Q1 to Q4. We continue to build momentum in this business with four consecutive quarters of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth to 6% in the fourth quarter, up from 5% in the third quarter.", "Enterprise backup continues to be the largest growth driver for Veritas. NetBackup Appliance grew 46% in fiscal 2015, accelerating to 88% in the fourth quarter. This success was driven by the recent launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which more than doubled the capacity of the prior model, giving us the ability to expand into larger enterprise environments.", "As an example, in the March quarter, we signed a $6 million appliances deal with a major telco provider based on our backup appliances' ease of use and lower total cost of ownership. While our appliance is the fastest growing in the market, we've only penetrated 10% of our installed base. Our NetBackup software also grew above market, achieving growth of 11% in fiscal 2015.", "Additionally, we saw strength in our Archiving and eDiscovery products with Enterprise Vault growing 5% and eDiscovery accelerating its growth to 11% in the fourth quarter. We expect our momentum to continue in fiscal 2016, driven by increased R&D investment which is leading to new releases in every one of our foundational enterprise products as well as next-generation solutions, which expand our addressable market and provide new capabilities such as information orchestration, IT resiliency, and information map.", "Moving to our Consumer Security segment. During fiscal 2015, we expanded our Consumer Security operating margin to 53% by streamlining our operations through business simplification and cost reduction.", "In fiscal 2016, we expect to maintain our Norton operating margin between 52% and 54%. The Norton organization is also focused on key initiatives to mitigate revenue declines while maintaining our current profitability, which include increasing customer acquisition by refining our marketing messaging and optimizing our pricing for our premium service offering; migrating existing consumers from an annual renewal to our subscription offering; boosting retention by improving the user experience throughout the customer lifecycle, including informing customers where Norton has blocked high profile threats; and lastly, expanding distribution channels through telcos and other service providers.", "Moving to our Enterprise Security segment. The increasing complexity of threats, the scarcity of cyber security talent, and the need for actionable intelligent security solutions are driving opportunities in our Enterprise Security business. During fiscal 2015, we've returned Endpoint Protection to market growth, continued to take share in Data Loss Prevention, established a strong presence in Incident Response Services, and reallocated investments to growth areas such as Threat Protection, Information Protection, and Cyber Security Services. And to better protect Symantec customers, we operate the largest civilian cyber intelligence threat network in the world, updated at a rate of 200,000 threats per second. This is the foundation for Symantec's Unified Security analytics platform.", "In fiscal 2015, we experienced a strong resurgence in Endpoint Security, which grew 5% during the full year and accelerated to 6% growth in the fourth quarter, driven by increasing awareness of attacks on the endpoint where most unencrypted data resides. Our Data Loss Prevention, or DLP offering, also experienced above-market growth of 14% in fiscal 2015 and is the undisputed leader in the market with double the share of the next largest competitor. DLP growth accelerated to 33% in the fourth quarter as we expanded DLP into cloud deployments, such as Office 365.", "Another important part of our Enterprise Security business is Trust Services. We were the world's largest SSL certificate authentication provider with 44% market share. Trust Services had a record year, reporting the highest revenue in its history, growing 4% in fiscal 2015 and driven primarily by our enterprise offering that solves for a comprehensive set of website security challenges.", "Our Cyber Security Services also showed strong momentum in fiscal 2015. We now have one of the broadest service offerings in the industry, covering the full attack lifecycle from before, during, and after a breach. Our Incident Response Service has engaged over 120 customers since its launch just a year ago. We expanded both the breadth and depth of our services by launching new Incident Response Retainer and Simulation services. The Retainer service, which launched in mid-February, is already off to a strong start, signing up major global brands and government clients in multiple regions in the first few weeks of availability.", "In the area of Advanced Threat Protection, we have now entered the ATP market, which is growing at 40% per year. Earlier this month, we shipped the first two of our Advanced Threat Protection solutions, the ATP: Network appliance and ATP: Email. By early fall, we will deliver our ATP: Endpoint offering.", "Our key ATP solution has two key differentiators: one, integration of the Endpoint, Email, and Network control points and our ability to gather, correlate, and analyze data across all three; and two, it leverages the combined intelligence of our Unified Security analytics platform.", "In conclusion, we're confident that the momentum we've established in fiscal 2015 sets a strong foundation for future growth and improving profitability in fiscal 2016. As we outlined at Financial Analyst Day, we expect Veritas to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal 2016 and significantly expand operating margin to between 27% and 29% by growing our core portfolio and offering differentiated next-generation information availability and insight solutions that address an expanded market opportunity.", "In Consumer Security, we expect to maintain operating margins of 52% to 54% while executing on our initiatives to mitigate Norton's revenue decline to down 5% to 8% in fiscal 2016. In Enterprise Security, we will leverage our global scale and unique assets to drive differentiated offerings in Threat Protection, Information Protection, Cyber Security Services and Unified Security analytics to accelerate revenue growth to between 1% and 6% in fiscal 2016.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results and guidance for our fiscal first quarter. Thomas?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Through increased focus, we are returning to growth, right-sizing the cost structure, and improving our profitability. We also returned more than $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. All of this was accomplished in the midst of executing the Veritas separation.", "Implied billings grew 4% in fiscal year 2015 compared to the 8% decline in fiscal year 2014. Deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.7 billion compared to the 6% decline in fiscal year 2014, giving us confidence in our growth trajectory. We reported non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3% for the year. We are pleased with this progress and the momentum as we enter fiscal year 2016.", "Now let me provide some details on the fourth quarter financial results. We delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.55 billion, within our guided range. The U.S. dollar continued to appreciate significantly against major currencies, which created a headwind of $111 million to our fourth quarter revenue and $292 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis.", "Our implied billings were up 2% year-over-year, now the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, and deferred revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter. License revenue continued its positive trend from last quarter, growing 10% year-over-year driven by appliances and DLP. The number of larger deals greater than $300,000 and larger than $1 million increased 35% and 82%, respectively.

This growth was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management.

The renewal team exceeded its targets and improved renewal rates. The license compliance team accelerated its audit activity and beat its full year targets. Our pricing optimization efforts resulted in a significant improvement in price realization and optimizing the Norton business and streamlining product support delivered cost savings and operating margin improvements.

For fiscal 2016, revenue is expected to be between $6.21 billion to $6.35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 0% to 2% after adjusting for the extra week and foreign currency. Operating margin is expected to be between 29% and 30%, resulting in EPS in the range of $1.80 to $1.90. Our guidance for the year assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect cash flow from operations to grow 12% in fiscal 2016. For the June 2015 quarter, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.10. It's important to note that the year-ago June 2014 quarter included an extra week and the revenue for that extra week was $113 million, which we are excluding from our year-over-year calculations of growth rates.", "We expect revenue to be between $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion, representing growth of 1% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 27% and 28%, representing expansion of 685 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint and resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.44. Typically, our June revenue is down sequentially 1% to 2% on an as-supported basis. Our June 2015 revenue our guidance reflects normal seasonality.

Operator, will you please begin polling for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Helyn Corcos - Vice President-Investor Relations", "We're ready for our first question, Gwen.", "Operator", "And we'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Jefferies.", "Brad Zelnick - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. My first question for Thomas, and I've got a follow up as well. Thomas, it actually goes back to the full-year guidance that you reiterated today and you initially give us last month. For operating cash flow, you've guided cash flow to grow 12% year-on-year. But if I look at that relative to your non-GAAP EPS guidance \u2013 you've actually guided non-GAAP EPS down a couple of percent. And I think it would even be a bit worse than that if we added the restructuring in which is excluded from your non-GAAP guidance. Can you bridge for us the delta between those two? Thanks.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, that's a good question. So, cash flow a year-ago was $1.3 billion if you add the 12% that we guide; on top of that, you end up with about $1.5 billion. There are three moving parts you have to keep in mind, of course restructuring costs. But that is actually a benefit for fiscal year 2016. Our restructuring costs in fiscal year 2015 were about $206 million and we forecast the restructuring and separation costs at the midpoint of $150 million, so it's about $50 million to $60 million lighter. We expect on top of that continued operational improvements and an increase in deferred revenue. And that would deliver the delta and explains the $200 million improvement year-over-year.", "Brad Zelnick - Jefferies LLC", "That's actually very helpful. And my follow up also on the full-year guidance. You've maintained the full year, that hasn't changed since that, but it seems Q1 is a bit below consensus estimates at least, and I think you touched on this in your prepared remarks. But can you just help us to appreciate the factors unique to Q1 this year and how they impact seasonality?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Good question. So, on the revenue side, there are a couple of moving parts. We try to be transparent at Analyst Day on how those come together. But the comparison revenue for the first quarter a year ago is about $1.735 billion. There's an extra week included in that number of about $113 million and that revenue was delivered at an exchange rate of $1.37 so that is another $117 million impact that you would have to correct for. And that would make the comparable revenue number about $1.505 billion. So we guided revenue for this quarter, for the \u2013 in the range of $1.5 to billion $1.54 billion. So, at the midpoint of $1.52 billion, that would be a year-over-year growth of 1%. So the math is a little bit tricky, but I think it shows that the momentum that we have been talking about is continuing. Unfortunately, there's some headwinds in difficult compares, but the trajectory is in the right direction.", "Brad Zelnick - Jefferies LLC", "Very helpful. Thanks again.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, guys. A fundamental question \u2013 thanks for all that clarity on both cash flow and FX, really helpful. The increase \u2013 the acceleration in endpoint, can you drill down a little bit on where that's come from? I mean, generally we again obviously think of this as a mature market. What's taking place there that's accelerating? And are you not seeing any of the former headwinds moves to three types of enterprise offerings?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm not sure about the last part of your question. I mean nothing moves to...", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Three types of enterprise offerings. In other words, I mean specifically...", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Oh.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "(24:58) embedded.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I guess we're not seeing impact there. I would say that \u2013 and there's been some things that have been written about, there's a resurgence of interest in the endpoint because, of course, that's where a lot of attacks get through; that's where a lot of the unencrypted data is, for example. So I think we're seeing increased awareness that that's a very important part of the whole Enterprise Security infrastructure that needs to be protected.", "But I would also say that we're significantly seeing increase in the DLP business because more and more workloads are moving to the cloud. So I think both of those trends are key for us: increased interest in the endpoint, which is allowing us to accelerate the growth of our SEP product as we talked about, that accelerated its growth in Q4 up to 6% year-over-year; and then DLP which through the growth of workloads in the cloud is actually accelerated 33% year-over-year in the quarter.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just for Thomas. On that first quarter, the currency impact, just as we back into it, it looks particularly strong relative to the decline in the euro that you're using in your international exposure. It looks like a stronger impact on a relative basis than what we saw this quarter. Is there anything in terms of the mix that would cause that?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, except how the product mix and the regional mix is working out. At this point, there are no special or extraordinary influences on how the numbers came together.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks. Thomas, I'm wondering if you could talk about \u2013 you mentioned the $250 million of incremental operating margin that sort of the run \u2013 sounded like that was a run rate that you'll realize in 2016. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand how much of that is a delta versus what you realized in 2015? Just clarify that comment, just trying to figure out what to do with that number.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so if you look at the margin for the whole year, we accelerate from 27.3% in fiscal year 2015 to a range of 29% to 30%. So if you look at the percentage increase is, I would say about half of that improvement really in margin structure is \u2013 actually it's a little bit more than half of it is driven by cost structure improvement and the efficiency momentum that we take with us.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And in that \u2013 and that is \u2013 the $250 million is that piece?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just a product question, I guess kind of a revenue product question. It sounds like backup, archiving, backup appliances all doing very well. Those are the \u2013 I guess as we see in your business, those are the biggest parts of the Veritas business. Can you talk about where you're still seeing a drag in that business? And have any of those drags become more significant to offset some of that accelerated momentum in the backup and archiving area?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Walter, I think Backup Exec is the drag on the business at this point. And as we've talked about \u2013 now, I should add, we introduced a new version of Backup Exec, Backup Exec 15. So we expect that will help moderate those declines. But overall, we expect more of our resources, or more of our resources have already been deployed to enterprise backup, because we feel that's where our real strength is. So I think the Backup Exec 15 will help us there in that market. But again, our focus is going to continue to be on the enterprise for Veritas.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And that 11% growth is NetBackup? Not total backup?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's correct.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just \u2013 I would also take a minute to add as we talked about, we are seeing strength in areas outside backup, too. So Enterprise Vault, our Archiving product, eDiscovery are also up pretty significantly. So we're seeing through some improvement in our sales execution and renewal rates. We're seeing the strength be broader than just backup.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking my questions, guys. Maybe to start with a follow-on to what Walter was asking. It seems like in the Enterprise Security business, you guys \u2013 there's some definitely key areas of strength, the endpoint business, which I believe is probably the largest part of the business is seeing growth, DLP's seeing strong growth. And we're hearing about some of the \u2013 seeing sort of drags on growth that we've heard for a while with Endpoint Management. It seemed like a similar dynamic going on in Information Management, where NetBackup's been doing well for a while, Backup Exec appears to be a drag. Are we starting to get to a point with either of those where it's just \u2013 just from a mix shift, just the base of those drags are getting smaller than the Endpoint Management business is getting to a point where it's small enough that it's just not going to exert as much of a negative influence on the overall segment on a go-forward basis?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Keith, I think that's true. And we expect to see growth from more of our product line, a broader set of product families going forward. So as it relates to Endpoint Management, we're envisioning some capabilities as we continue to think about how do we refresh that product line. Endpoint Management will be able to provide mobile capability going forward. We're going be delivering that capability from the cloud. So we're not just leaving Endpoint Management to decline. We're going be investing in that area because we see some opportunity. To your question, we see not only strength in endpoint and DLP going forward but also ATP, our Advanced Threat Protection. Of course, we just introduced the first two parts of that three-pronged solution in this quarter, in the current quarter that we're in.", "And in fact, it was early May. But now we're going to add the third in the first half, which is endpoint that we think that's going to give us the strongest capability for Advanced Threat Protection that exists in the marketplace. I can be happy to talk about why we feel that way. Our Trust Services business now is bigger and continues to grow. And our Cyber Security Services, we're seeing business activity there that is quite strong that we feel confident will lead to revenue growth in FY 2016. So not only will the loss from Endpoint Management be smaller, as you point out, but strength from a broader cross-section of products FY 2016.", "One of the things we're enthused about too, if I can just add, Keith, is, of course, the dedicated sales focus. So this will be the first time \u2013 it just started this quarter where you've got dedicated sales forces, one for Security, one for Veritas. And on the Security side, we have 40% more quota-carrying reps in our sales force for Security. So I think that's going to help us frankly on both Veritas and Symantec sides.", "Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And a follow up on that point. In terms of the APT solution, and I know it's pretty new to the market, but can you help us get a sense of what type of uplift you could see from the customer as they move from just what has been your traditional endpoint solution to start to adopt these endpoint technologies on top of that?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "While, we think it could be pretty significant, what we don't know is how quickly we can realize that. Obviously, our installed base is key there. As you know, we have an installed base of over 100 million enterprise endpoints. So the combination of the Network, Email, and Endpoint product and the ability to look across those control points to prioritize the incidents which is the number one complaint we hear from security operations professionals is you're overwhelming us with alerts, we need some clarity about what is the most important things to focus on. So our solution is really going to give those professionals that capability.", "In addition, of course, we're going to be able to correlate what are we seeing with the threat intelligence base that Symantec has access to, that's clearly a strength where we will outshine the competitors. And added to that, we don't require you to install an expensive appliance, which, as you know, can be up to $0.5 million per appliance. So we're delivering the solution with virtual appliances from the cloud. So very cost effective. We believe the efficacy rate of what we're going be able to block is more significant and the productivity for the security analysts who are watching this information is going to be much higher.", "Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. If I can maybe sneak in one last one for Thomas perhaps. It looks like \u2013 I think it was another 670 heads (33:55) this quarter. Where are we in terms of sort of getting to a baseline? Are there more cuts to come on a going-forward basis or is this the majority of the reductions that we should be expecting and from here it's going to be more sort of this is the baseline Symantec, Veritas, and we'll be growing from here?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Very fair question. We're not completely done yet. There will be some more work that needs to follow as part of the separation and setting up the right structures. So we will see some continued work in that direction. We also have been rather clear that that something that happens outside especially of the product group. So, on the R&D side, it's rather the opposite phenomenon, especially on the security side we're going to increase spend for development.", "Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Excellent. Very helpful, guys. Thank you.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You could say that we're probably halfway to two-thirds through what we announced as a roughly 10% cut back in November.", "Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Excellent.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, guys. Thanks guys for taking my question. Just wanted to double-click on the go-to-market here. Thomas and Mike, you both talked about improvements that you've seen on the renewals team and then the auditing side and also the split of the two sales forces. Just wondering if you could give us sort of an update on sort of \u2013 from your opinion, sort of where we stand of the go-to-market strategy, sort of the stability in it, any more changes coming in this fiscal year or is sort of everybody in that lane know what they do and what do you think that means to productivity?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so I feel like we pretty much have made the changes that we need to make there. We were very clear to apply the learnings from several years ago. A good example of that is there was no fifth quarter to drain the pipeline that happened before we made that dramatic change in sales force, September 2013 if I remember the date right. So that was not the way we approached that this time. And, of course, you could argue that was a much more disruptive change in general because you're splitting new versus renewal so the skill set you could say that was required and whether we got that right could be questioned. So not that type of change.", "Some of the focus by business line had partially begun especially in the more mature markets, but now that's completed. We began the planning for this about six months ago. We named the sales leadership at the top level right around September, even though we were not able to publicly announce the separation at that time. We knew that announcement would be coming. And now we've had worldwide sales conferences for both Veritas and Symantec, which I think were very successful, where we not only got those folks together, everybody knows which lane they're playing in to use your language and what their quota is and territory, et cetera, their management, but also we're trained for very focused sales plays. If you look at the evolution of the product line from two years ago to today, it's much more streamlined in terms of where our focus is by product area, and we want to make sure that our sales force is capable of running the sales plays in these focused areas.", "And then the point that we just made a minute ago, we've increased the quota-carrying reps 20% on the Veritas side, 40% on the Symantec side. So many more quota-carrying reps, while we've actually reduced the overall sales head count. So we have a much more focused sales force not only in terms of product line but folks with a quota that they need to meet. I think we have made the key changes that we need to make. What we'll need to do from here is more of a fine-tuning nature.", "Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.", "Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. This is Fatima Boolani on behalf of Brent. I was just wondering if you could spend a little bit of time talking about the 800 point delta sequential decline in Information Management segments. I know you touched on kind of the appliance shipment volumes being very strong but I'm just trying to better reconcile that.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so you mean the margin development for Veritas. I think we have been trying to be clear on this topic. It was driven, of course, by currency headwinds to a certain extent but also by the huge growth we have seen in the appliance segment. Mike talked about the year-over-year compare. So this has diluted the margins to a certain extent. And if we look now forward, we are quite confident that we can recover that for a variety of reasons. First of all, we will see margin improvement on the Veritas side just based on the higher revenue. We also see that the cost and deficiency momentum that Veritas is carrying is going to deliver significant improvement year-over-year. And the margin dilution effect of the appliances is becoming smaller with the shipment of the new products addressing a higher end market. And having, to be very honest, by itself significantly higher margin compared to the current version of appliances that we ship.", "Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC", "And then maybe just along those lines we take a step back and take a look at the short- to medium-term gross margin profile. So as you expect a higher end SKUs to add to the mix but considering the focus and reinvestment on the cyber security and incident response side, I'm wondering if you can comment on what the gross margin trajectory would look like for the short- and medium-term.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, just to remind, we finished the year with an operating margin of around 19% on the Veritas side, 53% for the Consumer business, and around 14% for Enterprise Security. Was your question about operating margin or gross margin?", "Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC", "On gross margins.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, let me comment on the operating margin first and then go back. So if you look at the Veritas business, that is going to expand, that is where we see a lot of improvement in fiscal year 2016. We're going to get that into a range of 27% to 29%. The Consumer business is going to stabilize around that number. And we rather outspoken that the margin for the ES business is going to come down slightly because of a higher R&D expenditure.", "So if you would translate that, especially on the Veritas side, into gross margin, we think the gross margin is going to improve with hopefully easier currency compares and a less dilutive effect of the new appliance margin, appliance product shipping into a larger market and a higher price market segment.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So the 5330, which we just began shipping, in fact, this most recent quarter we reported, it really reflects only about one month of shipment of the new 5330. So that has a higher margin, gross margin, than the appliances we had shipped previously. And as we look through the year, we will have another doubling of that capacity for the 5330 coming later in the year. So there's a lot of opportunity to improve the margins in our appliances business with the greater shift in mix to the 5330 and moving up to the higher capacity later this year.", "Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC", "And the last one from me, if I could. The content subscription line declined much less, and it's sort of turning the corner, it seems like, at a minus 1% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. I'm wondering if there was any particular areas within the three buckets, so content, subscription, maintenance that were particularly helpful there, and sort of when we can kind of start seeing growth in that revenue line?

Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Pat, we really couldn't hear the question. Would you mind repeating it? You're cutting in and out.", "Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC", "Could you explain in more detail some of the changes you plan for Consumer Security around optimizing prices and new distribution channels?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Oh, sure. Okay, great. Yeah, so one of the things that we're doing as we've streamlined the product line to one single subscription offering is now thinking about some merchandising or different segmentation of that. So it's still the same basic product, which means we get a lot of cost efficiency there, but having a premium capability allows us to offer more for the customers who want more. So the premium offering has MSRP of $89.99. That allows you to protect up to 10 devices, includes parental controls and online backup. So that's a lot more capability than what you get with the basic Norton Security. All of the offerings will have the same level of enterprise-grade security provided to the consumer. So that's what we're doing on the premium offering.", "In addition to that, obviously we're focused on the Norton business and improving our online customer acquisition. So there's a lot of A/B testing going on there, looking at keywords and other things to make sure that we're making the most of acquiring online customers. We talked about the migration to the subscription service. That's something that started in the \u2013 in North America with the December quarter. We just announced the subscription and started launching that basically in the month of September. So that just started. So everyone in North America will be on a subscription service as we lap that by four quarters. We're just now launching that internationally. So that's happening now in the April to June period internationally and, of course, that will take us another year to get everyone on a subscription service internationally.", "In addition, the distribution partnerships, we have partnerships today with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom, and SoftBank in Japan, so covering some of the major regions. We're looking at whether we can expand distribution through additional partnerships. And, in fact, one that we just added is a company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, one of the largest carriers in Latin America. They have several hundred million customers in Latin America, which we would have not been able to access before through a partnership like this.

So the channel \u2013 we found very few channel partners that really were crossing both Enterprise Security as well as our Veritas business. So the focus that we've achieved there, I think, has gotten a number of partners excited. Many of them attended our sales conferences that we just had. We just saw some interesting data from the channel saying Symantec continues to be the most recognized brand in terms of protecting customers for cyber threats, which we saw was an interesting bit of data. It gives us encouragement that, as we go forward, the channel still a very important part of our business and still very much believing that Symantec is the best supplier for them.", "As we talked about in previous calls, we have a new channel program, which is very much in place giving the channel better economics for getting certified in key product lines. So as that has occurred, their opportunity to get better economics from us as they focus on our products and learn more about them works both ways. We expect that to be able to help us build our volume as well as provide better economics for them as they get certified.

Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so, of course, we have a couple of moving parts. I think the momentum we saw on larger and big deals is just a recognition of what is happening in the market space from a threat perspective. It was very targeted around the verticals that you would think are under attack, financial sectors, the government, and healthcare. And it was compensated in part by product mix effect from businesses that we have covered \u2013 or Mike has covered previously and that tracked a bit on the overall Enterprise Security business momentum.", "Aaron Schwartz - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Is there any way, I don't know if you can, but \u2013 because it seems like from the growth in the large deals, we would have expected maybe stronger billings on just the Enterprise business, excluding the Consumer. I don't know if you can quantify where the Enterprise billings were versus the overall 2% billings growth or not, just to try to better understand those moving pieces?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I don't really want to get into commenting on billings on a segment level at this point in time. We had a lot of moving parts. I think that is fair to say. And as I said before, the momentum we saw on the large deals was compensated by other product mix movements.", "Aaron Schwartz - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But I think you could say that some of the big deal momentum we saw was also driven by our appliances business. So I'd say without providing the detail by segment that Thomas talked about you'd see the momentum both \u2013 across the Enterprise business, so both Veritas and Symantec.", "Aaron Schwartz - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. And a quick second, if I could. Thomas, on the Enterprise Security subscription services that you announced there's been a number of new launches here. Are those billed monthly or annually? Or how should we think about those coming out of the balance sheet? Thank you.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Very good question. Most of them are billed annually.", "Aaron Schwartz - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you very much for joining us this afternoon.", "Operator", "Thanks, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

And welcome to the Symantec's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Doros", "Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for joining our call to discuss second quarter 2016 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We\u2019ve posted our presentation and CFO commentary that complements our prepared remarks. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on our Investor Relations Events page. A copy of today\u2019s prepared remarks will be available on the website after our call is completed.", "Speakers on today\u2019s call are Mike Brown, Symantec\u2019s President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Implied billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue and we include a trended history of this metric in our supplemental information. Also, we provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS.", "I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Thomas will be presenting at the Nasdaq Conference on December 2nd in London and the Barclay\u2019s Technology Conference on December 9th in San Francisco. Mike will be presenting at the Credit Suisse Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on December 3rd. We intend to announce our third quarter earnings on February 4th.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Lastly, today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.", "Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K and the year ended April 3, 2015.", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Mike Brown", "Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 18 months ago, we embarked on a three-year transformation to refocus Symantec\u2019s product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value.", "Over that period, we advanced our long-term strategy by separating Symantec into an Information Management provider, Veritas and a pure-play cybersecurity company focused on delivering upon our Unified Security strategy.", "We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by January 1st. We have added new executive leadership across Symantec to complement an already talented employee base. During this transformation, we improved our cost structure, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin increasing from 25% in the first quarter of fiscal \u201815 to 28% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201816. We also returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Now that we are entering the next stage of our transformation, we are focused on four priorities that include, realizing our Unified Security strategy, building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities, improving our cost structure, and efficiently allocating capital.", "Let\u2019s start with why our Unified Security strategy is the right approach for today\u2019s complex and evolving threat landscape. Cyber attacks are damaging the ability of enterprises across the world to conduct business efficiently.", "Today\u2019s leaders including CISOs, CEOs and governments are looking to Symantec to be their trusted cybersecurity partner. Symantec\u2019s current set of enterprise security solutions provide our more than 370,000 customers actionable visibility into the security control points across their on-premise data and in the cloud.", "In an environment where hacking has evolved into highly-funded cyber espionage, we must not only create better solutions, but we must think differently in order to stay ahead of zero day attacks.", "Our Unified Security strategy does just this by harnessing our vast telemetry, including that from our 175 million endpoints, to provide customers with insights on the next generations of threats and as a result, more secure outcomes.", "The first of our four priorities is centered on new product development and increased product integration. We are bringing to market applications which run on top of our analytics platform, a core tenet of our Unified Security strategy.", "As an example, one of these new offerings is our Risk Insight application, which is a risk assessment benchmarking offering that combines data across SEP and Norton, as well as other external data sources.", "The solution provides a real-time assessment to both internal and external risk using the latest techniques in machine learning and data analytics, and has been well-received by several large banks. We expect to release this application by the June quarter.", "Including Risk Insight, we have a pipeline of a dozen new Enterprise Security products set for release in the next three quarters across Threat Protection, Information Protection and Cybersecurity Services.", "The second of our four priorities is improving our Enterprise Security sales pipeline and go-to-market capabilities. Symantec has trusted brand recognition in cybersecurity, we have deep thought leadership in the world\u2019s most influential security experts and we have a focused global enterprise sales force and channel partners to address this opportunity. Now we need to better leverage these competitive advantages and to do so we recently hired a new Chief Marketing Executive, Dan Rogers.", "A key part of improving this go-to-market strategy involves renewed focus on the channel. At our October partner event, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive as we laid out our strategy with the launch of Secure One, an enhanced channel partner program tailored specifically for security-focused channel partners. The new program consists of training, deal registration, technology support and incentives to drive the results for successful long-term relationships.", "Our third priority is optimizing our cost structure now that we are a pure-play cybersecurity company. We remain committed toward reaching our long-term operating margin target of 30%.", "However, after we separate Veritas, there will be a number of remaining costs related to corporate overhead expenses that we\u2019d previously shared with the Information Management segment. We are focused on right-sizing our cost structure to properly position the company for the next stage of our growth. Thomas will provide more detail in his prepared remarks.", "That brings me to our fourth priority, which is to continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. As we previously stated, we remain committed to our aggressive share repurchase program. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million Accelerated Share Repurchase to be executed as soon as possible.", "While returning capital to shareholders will be a core pillar of our capital allocation strategy, we also see opportunities to deploy capital toward acquisitions that we expect to result in an appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders. I am confident we have the appropriate strategy, product development team and distribution capability that can successfully acquire, integrate, and accelerate acquisitions.", "Next, I\u2019d like to provide an overview of Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Our Q2 topline performance improved from Q1, which is evident in the strong sequential improvement of our year-over-year implied billings in Q2. Enterprise security revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter.", "Operating margin of 28% was at the high end of our guidance range as we remain disciplined with our investments across the business. While we are making progress in building our enterprise security sales pipeline for the second half of fiscal year \u201816, it is not at a rate to offset the shortfall we saw in Q1. As a result, we now expect full-year revenue to be at the low end of our previous guidance for Symantec security, which includes Enterprise Security and Consumer Security. Thomas will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks.", "Now let me now provide an update on each of our major product areas in Enterprise Security that includes threat protection, information protection, cybersecurity services, and website security, a more descriptive name for our Trust Services solutions.", "In Threat Protection, the endpoint and email control points continue to be ground zero for targeted attacks within the enterprise. Compared to competitive solutions, our SEP solution, Symantec Endpoint Protection offers the most complete and scalable set of technologies in a lightweight agent. For instance, our largest SEP deployment covers a footprint of approximately 600,000 endpoints, orders of magnitude larger than most if not all of our competitors.", "Endpoint protection grew again in the second quarter, driven by continued strength in our SEP offerings. Additive to this growth in fiscal year \u201817 will be our recently introduced advanced threat protection solution, which consists of three integrated modules: endpoint, email and network.", "In fact, our comprehensive ATP solution addresses the increased complexity of managing security as the only product in the market that uncovers, prioritizes and remediates advanced threats across multiple control points all from a single console with just a click and no new endpoint agents to deploy.", "Moving to Information Protection. With more data moving to the cloud and the sheer increase in mobile users, information protection that spans across cloud and mobile combined with behavioral analytics is a critical imperative for organizations.", "The strongest performing part of our portfolio today is information protection where revenue for our offerings grew 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by robust customer traction for DLP 14. A number of our large DLP deals included new DLP 14 capabilities to secure information stored in the cloud for Box and Office 365. The combination of our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management assets puts us in a unique position to capture this expanding marketing opportunity.", "Moving onto Cybersecurity Services. Most companies around the world do not have the in-house security skills needed to address the changing threat landscape, especially once compromised. Our Monitored Security, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Security Simulation services provide customers with a broad set of offerings to manage every phase of the attack lifecycle.", "During Q2, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew 3%, which is below what this business is capable of achieving. To accelerate our cybersecurity simulation service offerings, we recently acquired the company, Blackfin. Within 45 days of the acquisition, our team brought a new service called Phishing Simulation to market and announced its availability in October.", "Now onto Website Security. Website security is an essential component of Unified Security, and it\u2019s not just about SSL certificates. Symantec takes a more holistic approach through offering complete website security and management tools in discovery and automation.", "Additionally, we offer the Norton shopping guarantee, which increases consumer confidence through our Symantec trusted endorsement. Shoppers know they\u2019re dealing with a retailer they can trust, so they\u2019re likely to become loyal buyers who purchase more and come back more often. Norton Shopping Guarantee has proven to deliver 7% higher conversion rates and 5% more repeat purchases for our retail customers. Website Security revenue grew 5% this quarter, an acceleration from 3% in Q1.", "Now onto the Consumer Security segment. There has been no letup in the threats that attack consumers. An increase in Crypto-ransomware and the continual discovery of new vulnerabilities in the commonly used operating systems reinforce the need for consumer security and data protection.", "The Norton Security subscription service supports Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, iOS and Google Android enabling our customers to protect their devices from malware, phishing and scams as well as manage passwords, backup data and supervise children\u2019s internet browsing.", "In converting customers to our subscription service, we are shifting away from unprofitable channels, focusing on reducing churn and acquiring customers directly online and through our growing list of service provider partners.", "Our Consumer Security segment performed in-line with expectations as we continue to convert all of our millions of customers to a cloud-based subscription service. We are about halfway through this conversion, which we expect to be complete in the summer of 2016.", "We are also seeing continued improvements in key levers of our Norton business such as online customer acquisition, our most profitable channel, which generated over 600,000 new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q2, up 8% year-over-year. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value for these customers is 30% higher with the subscription model.", "The anonymous telemetry gleaned from the large Norton customer base continues to provide Symantec with a unique perspective into global threat patterns. Last quarter, we saw several high profile attacks on a broader set of IoT devices such as cars, so we continue to believe Norton can play a bigger role in protecting our customers in the future.", "As the global leader in cybersecurity, we operate one of the world\u2019s largest cyber intelligence networks, we see more threats, and protect more customers from the next generation of attacks. We help companies, governments and individuals secure their most important data wherever it lives. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunities ahead.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our second quarter financial results and guidance for our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Thomas?", "Thomas Seifert", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Before I get start, let me point out that given that the Veritas transaction has increased the complexity of our results and guidance, we have included a CFO commentary document on our website this time which will provide additional detail to my prepared remarks.", "On October 3, we completed an important milestone with the operational separation of Veritas. This is a substantial accomplishment that would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees. We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by the end of the fiscal third quarter.", "In conjunction with this separation, we have committed to returning significant cash to shareholders. We had previously announced our intention to return $2 billion to shareholders over 18 months after the closing of the Veritas transaction. I am pleased to announce that we are going to commence this $2 billion capital return ahead of the expected January close of the Veritas sale. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible.", "The expected $500 million ASR will be in addition to our normal repurchase activity of approximately $125 million of shares for the third fiscal quarter, of which about $105 million has been completed to-date. The ASR and our ongoing open market repurchases reflect the Board of Directors\u2019 and Symantec\u2019s confidence in our ability to achieve significantly improved performance and create sustainable value for shareholders, while it allows us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction\u2019s closing.", "Now, let me turn to second quarter financial results. Total revenue declined 1% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and was in-line with our guided range. As expected, growth in Enterprise Security and Information Management substantially offset declines in Consumer Security.", "Deferred revenue was flat year-over-year at $3.3 billion, an improvement from a 1% decline in our June quarter. As a result, implied billings were flat, also an improvement from last quarter.", "The U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies compared to the year ago period, which created a headwind of $99 million to second quarter revenue and $144 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 28.1%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range, as we continue to seek out efficiency opportunities throughout the organization. I will provide more detail in regards to efficiency initiatives later in my remarks.", "Non-GAAP net income of $301 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.44.", "Moving now to our business segments. Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $485 million, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We saw revenue outperformance from our DLP products, which grew 37% year-over-year. Endpoint security also had another solid quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year. This strength was offset by weakness in endpoint management, mail, and data center security.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10%, which was in-line with our expectations. We continue to carefully manage our investment in the business, as we shift more resources to higher enterprise security growth opportunities.", "In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 8% as expected to $420 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 55%, up 357 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margin was higher primarily as a result of continuing operational improvements in areas such as tech support and lower OEM royalty payments.", "We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline in a range of 5% to 8% for fiscal year '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our growing online acquisition rate and our customer experience.", "Information Management revenue increased 2% to $593 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 489 basis points year-over-year to 23%.", "Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $134 million. We made separation payments of $64 million and restructuring payments of $26 million during the September quarter.", "Capital expenditures were $71 million in Q2 and a total of $149 million in the first half of fiscal year '16. We returned $262 million to shareholders during the September quarter. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends and $160 million was used to repurchase 8 million shares at an average share price of $21.13.", "The expanded set of revenue and efficiency initiatives continues to improve our top-line and optimize our cost structure for fiscal year \u201816. Let me provide an update on three of these initiatives.", "First, our license compliance initiative, which we put in place to ensure customers are current on their subscription and maintenance agreements, is on track to deliver total revenue of $17 million for the security business in fiscal year 2016.", "Second, within the Symantec security business, we have implemented a plan of action to upgrade customers to the latest version of all our products. This allows us to shift support and development spending to higher growth initiatives, but even more importantly, it allows our customers to take advantage of the technology improvements in our latest releases.", "Finally, we are in the planning phase of leveraging and optimizing our existing data center cloud strategy to improve the overall cost of our IT infrastructure. I\u2019ll update you more on the progress of this initiative in the coming quarters.", "Now let me provide you with a high level overview of Symantec security\u2019s standalone financial profile for fiscal year 2016. As a reminder, all growth rates are year-over-year and in constant currency.", "Our revenue, operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016 represent standalone Symantec security and do not include Veritas, formerly our Information Management segment. The impact from Veritas will be included in GAAP EPS as discontinued operations for the third quarter.", "We are lowering second half fiscal \u201816 revenue outlook. While our Enterprise Security sales pipeline is growing, it is not enough to compensate for Q1 shortfall. Similarly, we are adjusting our non-GAAP operating margin guidance.", "Selling the Veritas business will result in transaction service agreements, TSAs and stranded costs, which are overhead expenses once shared with Veritas. These expenses include IT-related infrastructure and services, real estate, litigation, and to a lesser extent headcount.", "On an annualized basis, we expect to have approximately $130 million in TSAs and stranded costs. Our TSA costs, which represent about a third of the total, will need to be in place over the next year as we support the Veritas business\u2019s transition. While these TSAs are a headwind to our operating margin, Veritas will reimburse us for these costs in discontinued operations. Starting now and through fiscal year 2017, we expect to take aggressive action to right-size our cost structure by this amount. This will help us to move toward our 30% operating margin target.", "Moving onto our Q3 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our December 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect Symantec security revenue for our third fiscal quarter to be between $890 million and $920 million.", "For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue to decline year-over-year in a range of between 6% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 0.5% year-over-year.", "We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Excluding the impact from stranded costs and TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30% at the midpoint.", "We expect third fiscal quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.22 to $0.25, which assumes a share count of 665 million. Without the Veritas sale, we estimate that the Information Management business would have contributed an additional $0.23 per share to non-GAAP EPS.", "Moving onto our Q4 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our March 2016 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect fourth fiscal quarter Symantec security revenue to be between $885 million and $915 million.", "For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue guidance to remain unchanged from a year-over-year decline in a range of between 5% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 1% year-over-year.", "We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5%, resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.24 to $0.27. Excluding the impact from stranded costs and TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30.3% at the midpoint. Our guidance assumes a share count of 653 million.", "In conclusion, our team has made a lot of progress in achieving operational separation and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re on the right track in moving our business forward. As we enter the next stage of our transformation, we are well positioned to return Symantec to growth through both organic and inorganic opportunities.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jon to begin taking your questions.", "Jonathan Doros", "Thanks, Thomas. Operator, will you please begin polling for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. My first main question is like there are obviously lots of moving parts in FY\u201916. Is there any change without giving guidance, obviously to talk maybe qualitatively about the FY \u201817 because that will be probably the first clean year after the split?", "Mike Brown", "Right. Absolutely, Raimo. So if you think about the two components of the business, Consumer Security and Enterprise Security, our expectations for FY \u201817 would be unchanged from what we\u2019ve talked about at the Financial Analyst Day. And that was to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, the decline that we are seeing in Norton should moderate in FY \u201817 and the guidance we have for FY \u201917 is a decline of between 3% and 6% and improvement of the range of 5% to 8% that we are operating within this year.", "The Consumer Security remains unchanged. So the change from the revenue standpoint for FY \u201817 would really be around Enterprise Security. We are clearly pleased with the momentum that we are seeing in Enterprise Security, in particular the recovery from the core Q1 performance. So, we could see that in some of the numbers that we talked about. We are seeing particular strengths in a couple of product areas today, DOP endpoint, cyber security services.", "As I talked today in my prepared remarks, we have a host of new products, in fact a dozen new products in Enterprise Security. However, it will take time for customers to integrate those and for those to be contributing materially to our financial results. So the guidance we gave a year ago for FY \u201917 was that we would be in a range of 1% to 6% for revenue growth this year FY \u201916. And as you can see from the guidance that Thomas just provided, we will be at the very low end of that range closer to 1%.", "As we look forward to FY \u201917, it would not be conservative to think that will grow at the rate that we previously gave, which was 6% to 10%. So while it\u2019s too early to give specific guidance on what we would see for Enterprise Security, we will do that as we get closer to the end of this fiscal year \u201916. I think we have to say that it's going to be somewhere in between where we gave for FY \u201817 from our ending rate this year and the rate that we gave at Financial Analyst Day.", "On the margin side, we have a lot of work to do, as Thomas mentioned to reduce our cost structure, taking account of the TSAs and stranded costs as a result of the Veritas sale. In fact if you take the guidance that Thomas gave and you add about three points which would account for these costs, you can see we are operating very close, if not at the guidance we gave at Financial Analyst Day, which was a range for the security business of 30% to 31% operating margin. So, we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to get back to the earning potential of business, which would be our target of 30% operating margin. But it will take us through FY \u201917, pick out those costs and have that show through.", "Raimo Lenschow", "And I have a question for Thomas. So, TSA cost, et cetera, they will all be done in \u201917, so it\u2019s going to be a clean year on the cost side as well, or is there still some spillover?", "Mike Brown", "It\u2019s a whole set of TSA agreements. It\u2019s not just one. But the majority of those agreements are going to expire within the coming year -- within a year. That\u2019s true.", "Raimo Lenschow", "And\u2026", "Mike Brown", "So we won\u2019t start FY -- just to be clear, we won\u2019t be starting FY17 with those gone. That's just a few months away. It will take us that fiscal year to be able to reduce those costs.", "Raimo Lenschow", "Yeah. Yeah. I know this what I meant.", "Mike Brown", "Yeah.", "Raimo Lenschow", "Like it\u2019s the, Thomas said, it takes years, is it like the whole calendar year or is it fiscal year that you are talking about?", "Mike Brown", "For this year, yes, it\u2019s pretty much a year to take out the stranded cost that we will take us until the end of the fiscal year.", "Raimo Lenschow", "Okay.", "Mike Brown", "TSA\u2019s four quarters pretty much from finishing the transaction, closing the transaction and then stranded cost really until the end of the fiscal year \u201917.", "Raimo Lenschow", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Mike Brown", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard", "Hi. Just one question for Mike. Just on the new endpoint product, internet product now had a data early access. Could you give, help us understand, give us some feedback currently you're seeing in that product? So how broader you are seeing interest in your customer base? And you released pricing, I think, last week or the week before? Can you talk about how much you think you'll actually be able to realize incrementally in accounts. It seem like the pricing there was actually multiples of, you might be getting for AV and you should have see this add-ons may come at fraction of what the AV is not multiples?", "Thomas Seifert", "Sure, Walter. So we're very excited about the Advanced Threat Protection solutions. As you know it\u2019s three modules. It is network, e-mail and endpoint. Network is available today, e-mail is also available but our endpoint to comes at the very end of the quarter. So we are in our controlled availability at this point and general availability comes at the end of the quarter.", "The real power of these three solutions come when you work with all three together, because the key differentiation here with Symantec Advanced Threat Protection is that we are able to operate across these street multiple control points and then prioritize for the stock analysts, what are the threats that they should be worried about was really improves the signal-to-noise ratio, you don't have to worry about threats that have been remediated by our endpoint as an example.", "And they were also allowing stock analyst to remediate either quarantine or eliminate threat with one click from a single console across those multiple control points. This is a huge productivity improvement for stock analysts.", "The other key benefits, obviously, are from a cost standpoint these capabilities available in a virtual appliance as oppose to a physical appliance that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And we are correlating that threat information you are seeing in your local environment across your enterprise with what we\u2019re seeing globally. So you get advance notice of whatever is happening in your industry as an example from around the globe.", "So really key advantages and that's why the pricing is a multiple of what we're seeing today with our set products. The customer reaction has been enthusiastic as you\u2019d imagine given those productivity benefits that I talked about because one of the big expenses when security staffs are maintaining their environment or protecting their environment is of course the labor cost. It\u2019s not the cost of the technology that we\u2019re providing.", "So if we can make those folks more productive, we save a whole lot of money. So the reaction that we've seen even from the control availability of the other modules that are available and what the beta has shown us from endpoint is this is going to be one of our most successful products. So already in use in beta at a number of customers that are global financial institutions, healthcare really across the board.", "So we're pretty enthused but it is early, obviously without having the product in general availability, it\u2019d be too soon to start predicting what did that mean financially for us. And as I mentioned when I talk about FY \u201817 guidance, it\u2019s going to take -- you pick the number six and nine months for customers to really do their own testing integrate this and start buying in a sufficient quantity to affect the financials.", "Walter Pritchard", "And then just, like one of the product question, you mentioned in the script and I think it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve heard you say that you were upgrading your customers of free to latest version on the enterprise side. We\u2019ve seen other companies do that. Microsoft doing it with Win 10, there will others doing subscription like offering so they are keeping customers on the current version. I guess, the question on your end would be, are you foregoing a material amount of revenue by doing that that upgrade for free and how did you think about that versus the benefits of lower support costs and having everybody consuming your latest and greatest?", "Mike Brown", "Walter, I\u2019m not sure that I did say that. We are enthused about customers moving to more current versions of the product. What we do offer for free is working with customers to make sure they\u2019ve turned on all the features of our products. For example, CEP today is in my view by far the best protection you can have on the endpoint. I think that\u2019s why we are the leader in the market. It\u2019s because we have so many protection engines in place beyond what you get from AV which I know a lot of folks in the market like to say that\u2019s the only engine that we have. There is five or six engines in our CEP product today, including things like file reputation, intrusion prevention, behavioral analysis to understand what files are really doing.", "So we want to make sure that our customers have all those engines turned on and when they do, we\u2019re blocking more threats than anyone else. And we have proof of that in third-party testing. So again not sure what I said that made you think we were doing a wholesale upgrade of our enterprise customers, but we are trying to make sure that sub-customers as an example have turned all the features on of the product they bought.", "Walter Pritchard", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification.", "Operator", "We will go next to Daniel Ives with FBR.", "Daniel Ives", "Thanks. In terms of M&A, I mean how should we think about timing versus opportunity? I mean, is this just looking for the right situation, or do you feel like there's from a timing perspective more urgency to get a fuel in the tank in terms of the right acquisitions? That would be my first question.", "Mike Brown", "Okay. Well, I think as we\u2019ve said, we believe the M&A is a key part of the strategy. But let\u2019s look back at what we've done so far this fiscal year and even go back to last year. We\u2019ve made two acquisitions, so we\u2019re being highly selective in terms of looking at these targets. One was a Narus acquisition, which was getting a select group of data scientists, who can really help us accelerate unified security analytics platform that we\u2019re building. As we talked about earlier in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re getting the first application, something called risk insight that will be available basically in the second half of fiscal year '16. And then more recently Blackfin, which was complementary technology to add to cybersecurity services, specifically in the simulation services area.", "So we've already begun looking for what are the complementary targets out there. They need to be tightly aligned with the strategy. One of the things that I could be critical about our past is that perhaps we haven't gone after acquisitions that we\u2019re tightly aligned with the articulated strategy. And then as we\u2019ve also talked about in the past, where really we\u2019re going to be able to bring value if we look for complementary technology where we can use our distribution capability to grow that dramatically, perhaps the most successful example of that was our DOP business, which today is a flagship in the industry in terms of its performance.", "So I would say we're not in a hurry, I can\u2019t remember the words we use, but we know we\u2019re not in a hurry. There's a lot of opportunity out there, but we need to be very selective. It's not lost on us that most of these companies are trading at a multiple of revenue and obviously our multiple of revenue is quite low. So we\u2019re going to be very selective about choosing the right target, but stick with the strategy that we can grow dramatically and then have the appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders.", "Daniel Ives", "And just a quick follow-up. Just given the head-scratcher last night from competitor, are you seeing less threats on the enterprise given improving U.S., China relations, just thought I\u2019d ask it?", "Mike Brown", "No, we are seeing the threat landscape continue to be quite scary, threats are clearly on the rise. And certainly, if you look at where most of the threats are coming from, it\u2019s criminal activity with the greed motivation. So I\u2019m not sure if your questions really around state sponsored activity, but that is a very small fraction of the total threat landscape.", "Daniel Ives", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Brad Zelnick with Jefferies.", "Brad Zelnick", "Great. Thanks so much. My first question for Thomas is on billings, which were actually stronger than we\u2019d modeled and seasonally better than you typically see in Q2. But as we look forward ex-Veritas, can you help us with what to expect in terms of the seasonality and what the business looks like without Veritas baked in? And are you going to provide a pro forma balance sheet for us so we can model this out?", "Thomas Seifert", "Yes. To the last question. As we talked about, actually we\u2019ll adjust and clean up our historical numbers, so those numbers will be available to and after the transaction closes. And we do not expect our billings behavior from a seasonality perspective to materially change at the separation.", "Brad Zelnick", "Thanks for clarifying. And just following up on Walters question, I think Thomas, it was actually in your prepared remarks where you say that the company's implemented a plan of action to upgrade customers to the latest version of all of our products, hoping you can tell us a little bit more about what that means? But if it's any different than what Mike had already said, but is there a risk that gives customers a reason to may be go to market and reconsider competitors if there\u2019s some type of forced upgrade?", "Thomas Seifert", "It\u2019s not a forced upgrade, but it\u2019s really convincing customers that there is a benefit moving to our latest version. And in my remarks it was less from a -- do we do this for free, we don\u2019t. But if we have from an R&D and technical support cost structure as we have less versions to support, this of course frees up resources that you can redeploy towards high growth opportunities in the Enterprise Security segment.", "And that is the primary motivation behind driving this initiative on our side. So there\u2019s a customer benefit and from us -- for us the benefit is really that we can get cleaner is our setup and continue to optimize our investment opportunities as we have done over the last 12 months.", "Brad Zelnick", "And then maybe just -- maybe\u2026", "Mike Brown", "Just a couple more points on that. I think I did mention in my remarks that we have 370,000 enterprise customers. So you can imagine with the breadth of the product line and how many enterprise customers, how many different versions that we\u2019re supporting. And of course, what we found as we look across that customer basis is that because it sometimes cumbersome to upgrade to new versions, companies can be reluctant to do that.", "And what we all know is the threat landscape as I mentioned a minute ago is evermore complex. And we need to have customers migrating to more recent versions and making sure all the features are turned on of the products where they really are not protected in a way the products are intended. So as I like to say it, you locked the front door, but you left the windows open.", "So it\u2019s an conscious effort on our part to make sure that customers are protected. Now that benefits them, but from a business model standpoint, as Thomas referred too, that also gives us some more efficient business model.", "Brad Zelnick", "Thanks, Mike. And thanks, Thomas.", "Mike Brown", "You bet.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Michael Turits", "Hey, guys. Just a clarification on the longer-term margin outlook. So should I understand that fiscal '17, let\u2019s call it pro forma ex-TSA and stranded cost will be 30% and then how are you feeling about it for fiscal \u201918?", "Mike Brown", "Well, we\u2019ll provide update on \u201918 as we get closer.", "Michael Turits", "Give me fiscal \u201920, while you actually\u2026", "Mike Brown", "We -- I think we find the right balance in terms of trade-off getting the business to grow and delivering the profitability that we need. We think that 30% is the right target on compensated for stranded cost and TSA in fiscal \u201917. And we excited about the momentum we see on the topline from a business momentum perspective that allows us to grow moving forward of cost that this will have scaling impacts and benefits, but it\u2019s too early to call that in a specific number.", "Michael Turits", "Okay. Thanks. And then, Mike, just a continuation of the question regarding industry in general, you said, you\u2019re not seeing reduction in the tax. I assume that's both commercial and state-sponsored? And what about the question that was on last night\u2019s call from a competitor regarding with what they thought was a slowing in spending from elevated rates to something less elevated? Are you seeing that slowing in spending in the industry?", "Mike Brown", "We\u2019re not. Now at -- we have a much broader product line than I think the competitor you might be referring to. So and we\u2019re just entering. If you think about -- if your question really is related to FireEye\u2019s comments, they\u2019re clearly focused on Advanced Threat Protection. That\u2019s the market we don\u2019t even have exposure to yet in any material way. And of course, the other area of competitive overlap for us is services with Mandiant, which is so successful in the service arena.", "Our Incident Response business is newer than theirs. We are at capacity. We\u2019re trying to grow that as fast as we can, but obviously, they have a much larger position in Incident Response than we do.", "Michael Turits", "Yeah. So just\u2026", "Mike Brown", "We don\u2019t overlap as much -- we don\u2019t overlap as much. So my comments really are related to our business, and obviously, I don\u2019t see what they think.", "Michael Turits", "Yeah. I just was wondering if, anything is possible to make this observations from kind of general tone of the industry whether or not you thought that that there was some kind of change in the nature spending from a level of urgency to something less?", "Mike Brown", "We\u2019re not seeing at Symantec. We analyze 10 trillion security incidents a year. So the scale of what we\u2019re seeing only continues to increase.", "Michael Turits", "Thanks Mike, Thanks, Thomas.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Matt Hedberg", "Yeah. Thanks guys for taking my questions. I wanted to circle back on the consumer business, in your prepared remarks I know you guys mentioned the migration to cloud-based subscription sounds like it should be done by next summer? And given the context of Norton falling, I think, you said between 5% and 8% this fiscal year? Once this migration is completed, is that really would gives you the confidence that this business can re-accelerated and once it does, maybe remind as about what the margin structure that business looks like?", "Mike Brown", "Sure. Well, I think, there\u2019s a number of factors play here. So one is, of course, the move to a subscription model, the other is our primary means of acquiring customers, which shifted from OEM and retail to online. So we talked about that being up 8% year-over-year. We added 600,000 new customers for Norton this past quarter.", "So about half of our business now is online customers and those tend to be the stickiest because they have made the positive decision to go with the best. I think we have been awarded the PC Editors Choice Award 37 times at this point.", "So they're making a positive choice to go with the premium offering for security. And we find that those customers have a larger lifetime value, 30% more relative to in fact a customer that comes in through OEM or retail.", "So that\u2019s what we\u2019re excited about in terms of driving some improved numbers for this business and getting back to a topline, its flat if not growing. The market for paid consumer security growing at low single digits, the no reason why this business wanted transform all subscription, primarily acquisition of online customers can't get to that level.", "And as I mentioned previously, we\u2019re looking at ways to leverage the Norton brand to get into some new areas. I\u2019ve talked about Internet of Things as an example. More and more consumer devices in the home exposed to security threats. So we're looking at some ways to drive the business to grow faster that will be separate from kind of the offerings that are available today. So it is that combination of things that gives us confidence that this business should continue to improve not just next year but in the foreseeable future.", "Then the margin structure, we said that our margin target is 52% to 54%. We've been a little bit better than that. Recently 57% in the first quarter, this quarter 55%. We do expect to operate in that more normalized range and part of the reason we\u2019re saying that is because we are making some investments in the business, improving the customer experience, investing in that acquisition channel, getting customer, more customers online. And then obviously some investment going to what can we do in new areas to leverage the Norton brand as I mentioned. So that will drive the margin a little bit lower than what we've seen in the last two quarters as we look further out.", "Matt Hedberg", "That\u2019s great. And then maybe, Thomas, looks like the Americas, I believe was maybe your lower growing yield this region. I think EMEA was a little closer to flat. Can you give us a sense, from a geographic perspective how we should think about performance in the second half of the fiscal year?", "Thomas Seifert", "Yeah. So, when you talk of the Americas, it is a mixture of regions. I think it\u2019s fair to say that our U.S. based business did well. Our federal business within that region did very well and EMEA met our expectations. We think moving forward there in the second half that that Europe could pick up a little bit in terms of overall contribution to our results and APJ is probably going to stay where it is. And we are just looking at the pipeline and how the momentum develops to see that the domestic business is continuing with the strengths we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter.", "Mike Brown", "In fact, I'll add to that. In the Americans in particular, for Enterprise Security new business activity, we saw the strongest year-over-year growth in the last 10 quarters. So, we wish we saw that consistently across the globe but Americas particularly strong.", "Matt Hedberg", "Very helpful. Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss", "Thanks for taking the question guys. I wanted to follow-up. There is many several opportunites drill down a little bit more into that consumer side of the equation. And this is -- I guess, this is much of a clarification than anything. So, when you talk about the 600,000 new subscribers to Norton, is that only on the online side of the business?", "And can you give us a sense of sort of what\u2019s the growth rate in the overall base and help us, how to understand the equation between sort of overall units versus ASPs, what's causing the declines in that business today? And how that like, which side of the equation is likely to recover and get you back to flat growth on a go-forward basis.", "Mike Brown", "Sure, Keith. So, we are going to transition and because the business is ratable, we are talking about customers rolling off, a download model into a subscription model. That\u2019s why we are taking so long for this transition. That\u2019s compounded by the change in how we are acquiring customers, moving from primarily OEM and retail into primarily online. So that\u2019s the dynamically that you are looking at.", "The 600,000 customers that we added were exclusively online acquisitions. So, obviously that\u2019s being offset by continued declines in retail and OEM. But of course, as we start to get the millions of customers, as we talked about before, we protect 65 million consumer endpoints out there. So, as we begin to reach the second half year of that migration to the subscription service, the numbers begin to look better.", "And what we are really excited about is when we get through that complete transition, which we talked about summer of 2016. It would be very interesting to see obviously, what the year-over-year comparisons look like then. But we have to wait a while to get to that point but that point of business should be primarily customers that we required online.", "Keith Weiss", "Got it.", "Mike Brown", "And maybe obvious to everyone is the fact that why do we feel that way. It\u2019s because retail customers tend to be shopping for the lowest price. They are doing that comparison and OEM customers don\u2019t necessarily renew it all. So you pay those fees up front a year later that customer may not renew with you at all. You paid that placement fee, you get no value for that, that\u2019s why we are so excited about this transition.", "Keith Weiss", "Got it. And then one element of the consumer business that you guys haven\u2019t talked about is the mobile side of the equation. Are you also seeing traction with sort of taking people using that mobile side of equation and is that helping ASPS to certain extent?", "Mike Brown", "Not helping ASP because we are providing that for free today. I wish we had a way to monetize that, but today we\u2019re providing mobile protection either for iOS or Android for free. You can download that Norton mobile at those apps stores. There may be a way in the future to monetize that. We don't have an idea for that today. There have been 10s of millions of downloads of Norton mobile.", "So that -- obviously it helps us with brand recognition of the top quality, consumer protection that we get benefit because we're incorporating that threat telemetry of what those mobile endpoints are seeing in our massive data base our intelligence network. But monetization is something that we'll have to wait for later day there.", "Keith Weiss", "Got it. And if I could sneak one last one in, on the channel program. You guys talked about the new channel program, you put into place. We\u2019ve heard excitement from your channel partners about this new program and maybe sort of refreshed emphasis on the channel. We also recently lost your head of distribution, who people looked at as a real sort of channel champion. And there was some -- in the trader, I had some concern that that might upset momentum in the rollout of this channel program. How do we garner confidence that you guys are going to be able to sort of sustain the momentum, sustain the focus of your channel partners through this leadership transition on distribution?", "Mike Brown", "So I think you are referring to our head of worldwide sales. He didn't leave -- he was terminated for cause. Now, the good news is, we have a pretty deep bench of folks with experience with the channel. Symantec always have been a channel company. We\u2019ve been a channel company for 30 years.", "So I think those partners who work with us for a long time know that our commitment is unwavering there. And it\u2019s great that we've now introduced Secure One, our new channel program, which now for the first time can be focused on security partners. I mean to be honest, our channel was the previously more geared towards our Veritas business, some of the larger deals that were stores deals versus security, that give us chance to work with those partners who are focused on security.", "And now we've got incentives in place a little bit as they get really trained on our products so we\u2019re certified. There is better economics or incentives for them. So, I think we\u2019ve got the right focus on getting those folks who specialized in security. And the right incentive so they can make more money by investing with us overtime.", "Operator", "And ladies gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A session of today's call. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any comments and closing remarks.", "Mike Brown", "Thank you for being with us.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Doros", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss third quarter 2016 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We have also posted a presentation and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations events web page. Speakers on today's call are Mike Brown, Symantec's President and CEO; and Thomas Siefert, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website. I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Implied billings refer to revenue plus a change in sequential deferred revenue. We provide constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS.", "I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Mike Brown will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on February 29 and attending the JMP technology conference on March 1 in San Francisco. Thomas Siefert will be presenting at the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 7. We intend to announce fourth quarter earnings on May 12 and will be hosting a financial Analyst Day on May 26 in New York City.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, in our annual report on Form 10-K in the year ended April 3, 2015.", "In connection with the Veritas sale, we have provided seven quarters of recast GAAP and non-GAAP financial income statements, third quarter and prior year-end balance sheets and GAAP cash flow statements of the trailing three quarters and FY '15. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas; however, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations. As a result, implied billings growth calculated from change in deferred on the balance sheet or cash flow statement will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance, as it will include an impact from Veritas. This quarter and going forward, we will disclose the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet that will represent standalone Symantec for calculating implied billings.", "And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Mike Brown", "Thanks, Jonathan and good afternoon. I am pleased first to announce that Silver Lake Partners has made a $500-million strategic investment which is a strong vote of confidence in both our transformation, as well as our future as a world leader in cybersecurity. Additionally, I'm excited to have Ken Hao, Silver Lake managing partner join our Board, given his deep expertise in technology and track record of creating value.", "As you know, we have been undergoing a three-year transformation which began in April 2014. At that time, we laid out five priorities that we had since successfully executed against. First, managing our businesses with a portfolio approach which included divesting Veritas and improving the profitability of our consumer business, while we invest for growth in enterprise security. Second, within enterprise security, we have been investing for growth by reallocating R&D spending to high-growth markets. Third, improving our cost structure where we have improved non-GAAP operating margins to 28% this quarter.", "Fourth, building a talented executive team, including new C-level leadership across most major functions. And fifth, returning significant cash to shareholders, with $2.1 billion in total share repurchases and dividends since April 2014. During this period, we also developed a well-articulated strategy for our security business which we call Unified Security. This strategy leverages our key competitive differentiator\" the global scale and footprint of our large install base, where we can correlate threats that our products and services see with Symantec's global intelligence network, the 8 trillion objects we monitor globally and in real time. After completing the divestiture of Veritas we're a more focused Company as the world's leader in cybersecurity.", "The second half of our transformation plan began last October and is focused on four priorities. Number one, delivering upon a product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy; number two, building our enterprise security pipeline and go-to market capabilities; number three, improving our cost structure further; and number four, continuing to efficiently allocate capital. I'll now cover each one of these priorities, starting with the first, delivering upon a product road map that leverages our Unified Security strategy.", "On a daily basis, chief information security officers and security operations analyst are overwhelmed by the vast number of security alerts that make it difficult to pinpoint advanced threats attacking their IT environment. Moreover, attacks are constantly evolving and leveraging a variety of techniques. This leaves traditional point solution vendors, that are only focused on a specific attack method, at a disadvantage. Protecting against these advanced attacks involves a unified approach to security to guard against multiple attack methods and an understanding of global threats in real time.", "This is Symantec's strategy which leverages our install base and competitive differentiation in using a big data approach to understand more about the threat landscape than any of our competitors. The first generation of product, leveraging our Unified Security strategy, our new solution in the areas of advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, cybersecurity services and applications that run on our Unified Security analytics platform. In total, we have launched 6 of the 12 new enterprise security products we outlined last year at our financial Analyst Day. We plan to release the remaining half within the next two quarters and have an additional set of new products in the pipeline for the second half of FY '17.", "The first three of these, our newly released advanced threat protection or ATP solutions, harness threat telemetry from the major control point of endpoint, email and network to not only detect, correlate and prioritize but also remediate threats. This solution does this all from one console without adding an additional endpoint agent. Key differentiators of Symantec's ATP approach are a cloud-based expandable sandboxing capability that works without expensive on-premise hardware, as well as the ability to correlate threats across the control point within an enterprise and against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. In recent independent third-party testing from NearCom and Dennis Technology Labs, Symantec's ATP solutions received the highest scores across all test categories against vendors including FireEye, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, meaning we stopped more attacks and blocked more threats with fewer false positives than any of our competitors.", "Our ATP solutions build upon a key core offering, Symantec's Endpoint Protection or SEP which is our largest product line within enterprise security and which is delivering next-generation endpoint protection today. Many competitors are delivering only a subset of endpoint protection techniques. As a result, customers would be required to install numerous agents on their endpoints to match the same level of protection that we deliver today with SEP. This slows performance at the endpoint and is cumbersome to manage.", "Symantec Endpoint Protection already combines multiple advanced protection engines across intrusion prevention, white-listing, behavior-based machine learning, signatureless detection of malware and suspicious activity, automation, application control, clustering and remediation, all deployed from a single agent. This layered approach which includes multiple protection engines, goes far beyond antivirus in delivering next-generation capability which is already being delivered to our more than 300,000 endpoint customers, protecting over 110 million endpoints and enterprises. This is the install base for which we're targeting our ATP solution.", "In our cybersecurity service offering, Symantec is also delivering Unified Security capabilities to customers through our Managed Security offering. This service monitors Symantec solutions, as well as third-party security products, to correlate threats against Symantec's global real-time intelligence network. In many cases, our Managed Security service operate side by side in existing customer SoC to act as complementary protection capability or later defense against attackers. As Symantec has been named a leader 12 times in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Security services. Finally, we will also deliver Unified Security capability through new applications that will sit on top of our analytics platform and leverage the vast threat data we see globally and in real time.", "Risk Insight which benchmarks and enterprise security posture against peers, is the first in a series of applications we plan to build on top of this platform. The solution is currently running in beta at a large financial services company and will become generally available this quarter. We're excited about this wave of innovation at Symantec which is resulting in the most robust organically developed product cycle in our history.", "Now on to the second of our four priorities which is building enterprise security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capability. Building robust pipeline incorporates strong brand recognition, a robust channel program, lead generation and focus sales plays. To educate the channel on our next-generation security portfolio and product road map, we conducted partner conferences across our three major geographies at special training sessions which included meeting with over 1,000 partners. During the quarter, we saw early momentum from the global system integrators and now are focusing to further enable our VARs distributors service provider and cloud providers.", "Additionally, we have launched a set of focused field sales plays aimed at driving new product sales in our install base, as well as replacing competition. For example, our ATP cross-sell campaign has identified over 3,000 accounts that have an SEP installation which represent over tens of millions of control points. Within those accounts, we have identified a subset that our immediate candidates for our ATP solution over the next five quarters as they have an upcoming endpoint or email renewal.", "We're already seeing positive results, despite ATP only being generally available for just over 30 days. As of February 1, we had nearly 1,200 customers that have either attended an ATP webinar or engaged with a Symantec expert. Over 350 customers who were actively evaluating our ATP solution and dozens of initial wins. One of the most notable wins was with a U.S. food manufacturer and existing SEP and email customer who purchased our full ATP endpoint, email and gateway solution to monitor over 10,000 control points. This customer reviewed competitive offerings and selected Symantec, given our integrated suite, single console and no need to deploy a new endpoint agent.", "Another example of a new go-to-market offering is how we're helping customers securely transition to Office 365 by leveraging our recently launched bundle that includes DLP for cloud, user authentication and our dot cloud email solution. Our Office 365 solution provides customers a cloud-based solution that secures inbound and outbound data for customers as they transition those workloads and associated administration to the cloud.", "With cloud-based workloads, it's even more important to ensure an authorized user is accessing information, that it's encrypted traffic and that data that shouldn't leave a customer's environment doesn't leave. Symantec's bundle combines these security capabilities for our customers. We're currently in discussions with many existing and prospective customers who plan to migrate tens of thousands of users to Office 365. Some will be brand-new wins for us and others will be an upsell opportunity.", "Our third priority is continuing to improve our cost structure now that the divestiture of Veritas is complete. We're announcing today a target of $400 million in cost reduction to be achieved over the next two years. Specifically over the next 18 months, we plan to eliminate $130 million of TSAs and stranded costs resulting from the sale of Veritas, of which there are large opportunities in the areas of IT infrastructure and real estate. Beyond the impact of TSAs and stranded costs, we believe we can achieve further reductions across the Company.", "The majority of these incremental savings will benefit us in FY '18 and beyond. As a result, we expect to reach a 30% operating margin as we enter FY '18. Now our fourth priority, capital allocation. Our management team and Board believe proper capital allocation is key to maximizing long term shareholder value and we have demonstrated this with a consistent track record of returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. We continue that consistent track record with our announcement today that we will return $5 billion in additional capital to shareholders by the end of March 2017 through a special dividend and share repurchases, bringing our total capital return in connection with the Veritas transaction to $5.5 billion.", "Next I'd like to provide an overview of Q3 results. Enterprise security revenue increased 1% year over year, the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth driven by 15% growth from information protection. Specifically, DLP again grew double digits. We're witnessing a resurgence in DLP demand across industries beyond the traditional verticals of financial services and healthcare that we've sold into, as more organizations realize they need to secure their intellectual property. We're the best positioned Company to capitalize on this opportunity which is further demonstrated by our market share which is twice the size of the closest competition and our recognition as a leader in Gartner's January 2016 data-loss prevention Magic Quadrant.", "Moving to our consumer security business, revenues here declined 6% which was at the better end of our down 6% to 8% expectation and an improvement from Q2. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with a large Indian telco to provide paid mobile security services to their customers. This is significant, as monetizing the mobile opportunity is still in its infancy when compared with traditional form factor. We believe mobile security sold through partners will be one of the levers to return the consumer business to grow over the long term. As Thomas will describe in more detail, we're on track to convert our entire customer base to a subscription service and acquire more new customers directly online. Further, as we execute against our broader consumer product road map, we will expand the Norton offering to address broader personal privacy and home IoT security opportunities.", "In summary, I believe we're well-positioned for acceleration in FY '17. Our consumer business will see moderating declines, while remaining extremely profitable at greater than 50% operating margin. We expect our enterprise security business to continue to grow in FY '17 based on the strengthening product portfolio and building pipeline. Finally, we have a focused organization to execute against our priorities. Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our third quarter financial results and guidance for our fourth quarter. Thomas?", "Thomas Seifert", "Thank you, Mike and good afternoon. Third quarter total revenue was $909 million, a decline of 2% year over year, was above the mid-point of our guided range on a constant-currency led basis. In Q3, approximately 88% of revenue is recurring in nature, 5% is perpetual and 7% is from services. Over time, we expect recurring revenue to become a larger portion of overall revenue, as more products are sold as a subscription. Deferred revenue was $2.5 billion which includes $396 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings, excluding Veritas, were $865 million. ", "The U.S. dollar appreciated against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period which created a headwind of approximately $40 million to third quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 27.9% and exceeded our guided range. Excluding the impact from GSA cost, non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 30% which is in line with our margin target. Non-GAAP net income was $172 million. We saw that fully diluted earnings per share of $0.26, above the high end of our guidance.", "Let me now provide further detail on our revenue performance by product area. Enterprise security revenue was up 1% year over year. Enterprise security operating margins were 5%. To note, enterprise security carries a higher burden of stranded cost. Within enterprise security, threat protection was down 4% and within threat protection, endpoint protection grew in low single digits. Offsetting this growth was continued weakness in our endpoint management solution which will soon be refreshed with our new identified endpoint management platform available this quarter.", "Information protection revenue grew 15%, driven by both data loss prevention, DLP and user authentication were both up double digits year over year. During the quarter, we closed over two dozen new DLP deals greater than $300,000, including one of the largest healthcare systems in the nation, where we beat out the competition to replace the legacy installation with our market-leading DLP solution.", "Cybersecurity services, CSS, was flat year over year. During the quarter, we opened a Singapore SoC which would further accelerate our expansion internationally. We're seeing positive underlying trends in CSS from both a secular and an execution standpoint and expect the business to improve its revenue growth performance in FY '17. Website security grew 3%.", "We continued to be the de facto standard for enterprise-level customers to secure their websites which is a stable and profitable business. Beyond the enterprise, we see demand for encryption and authentication accelerating, as security and privacy imperatives and identify and applications like e-commerce grow among businesses of all sizes which we believe represents at least $40 million additional websites worldwide of opportunity for our solutions.", "Now on to the Norton consumer security segment. Third quarter consumer security revenue was down 6% and operating margins were 56%. However, we're seeing improvement in the underlying fundamentals of the customer business -- consumer business performance which gives us confidence that revenue performance will continue to improve. From a business modeling standpoint, we evaluate the consumer security business based on four primary factors, customer satisfaction, subscriber renewal rates, new subscriber growth and pricing. For competitive reasons, we do not quantify those metrics externally, but believe it would be helpful to directionally describe our performance.", "First, customer satisfaction. We track our progress through Net Promoter Score which is one of the highest in our industry and expect that metric to trend higher. Second, renewal rates. We have completed the transition to subscription globally. This quarter, we have reached the one-year anniversary of the [indiscernible] transition in the U.S. and will reach the one-year anniversary in Europe at the end FY '17 second quarter. Customers on subscription renew at a significantly higher rate than those not on subscription.", "We expect renewal rates to continue to improve over the medium term as we transition more customers to subscription and the acquisition makes continuous moving towards digital channels. Third, new customer acquisition. We're focusing on acquiring more customers online and through ISPs, as those channels have proven higher lifetime values. During the quarter, new subscriptions from online again grew 8% year over year. This represents approximately half of new acquisitions. Lastly, we expect pricing to remain healthy as we deliver increased value to our customers in the form of next-generation consumer endpoint protection. Given the steady improvement in both renewal rates and new customer additions, we believe we're exiting the trough of the consumer business declines.", "Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations -- operating activities for the December quarter totaled $153 million and includes $56 million in outflows related to separation costs. Capital expenditures were $114 million in Q3. We expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $60 million. Now turning to capital return. As we mentioned previously, we would update our capital return plan post the completion of the Veritas sale. We will now be returning $5.5 billion which include the $500 million ASR that we executed in Q3 and an additional capital return of $5 billion.", "The $5 billion will be executed through a $4 per-share special dividend which will amount to $2.7 billion and a $2.3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by March 2017. The record date for the special dividend payable to shareholders will be close of business on March 8, 2016 and the dividend will be payable on March 22nd. Once we complete the special dividend, we'll initiate our stock repurchase program. We expect to execute approximately $900 million of share repurchases within Q4. After the completion of the capital return, we will have returned more cash to shareholders than the net cash proceeds from the sale of Veritas. Lastly, we're adjusting our ongoing quarterly dividend to $0.075 a share, starting in the first quarter of FY '17. ", "This adjustment reflects our lower domestic free cash flow post Veritas sale, but still represents a significant payout ratio on domestically generated free cash flow. We're committed to increasing this dividend as free cash flow grows over time.", "Now turning to guidance. Our constant currency Q4 revenue guidance of down 4% to flat is slightly higher than our previous guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 26% to 28%, down slightly from our previous guidance due to a negative impact from currency. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.27, in line with our previous guidance, as a lower tax rate offsets the decrease in operating margin expectation. We will provide FY '17 guidance when we report our Q4 results in May. In conclusion, we're seeing the underlying fundamentals of the business improve and we're well-positioned to execute on the second half of our transformation. Now I will turn the call back over to Jon.", "Jonathan Doros", "Thank you, Thomas. Operator can you begin polling questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow", "First, can you talk -- I know you don't guide for 2017, but can you talk a little bit about how you think about it? You're coming out of a lot of disruption and that should be the first clean year. How do you think and how should we think about that?", "Mike Brown", "Well, Raimo, I think we can talk a little bit about how we see the guidance directionally and of course, we'll be providing complete guidance when we announce next quarter. So here's how we're thinking about it. From a revenue standpoint and thinking about the two segments on the consumer side, we expect consumer business to perform basically in line with the outlook that we've been providing, so moderating decline as we go forward. Our guidance is really is consistent with what we provided at Financial Analyst Day. Our consumer business very much on track.", "On the enterprise side, of course, it's more difficult to forecast and we're in a period now where we have so many new products, as I talked about in my remarks. And until we have some better visibility into the traction that we see converting that pipeline into revenue, we would rather be conservative with our thoughts about the enterprise side. But I think it's fair to say that we'll be looking at where we finished Q4 and we will expect that would be the starting point and we would expect to grow modestly from where we finished Q4 as we go throughout FY '17.", "On the margin side, we should keep in mind a few things. Number one, seasonality -- from a seasonal standpoint, margins are typically down for us from Q4 to Q1. And as we've also talked about, we have a significant amount of these stranded costs supporting Veritas and then the stranded costs obviously that we need to take out. That accounts for about 200 basis points of margin.", "If you add those 200 basis points to the margin we reported today, you'd see we were at -- which was 28%, you'd see we were at the 30% target. But as we go forward into FY '17, we're expecting that the reported, as reported non-GAAP margins, where we're not able to adjust for those stranded costs, will be about the 200 basis point lower than what we see in FY '16. So lower operating margins and then that's our task as we begin this effort to take out $400 million in costs over two years to ensure that those are eliminated. So that as we start the following fiscal year, FY '18, we will be able to start that back at our target of 30%. That gives you a little bit of the feel of how we're thinking about it.", "Raimo Lenschow", "Okay and then one follow-up question more on the business. If you think the endpoint is the one where you see a lot of extra competition coming in at the moment. You have a new product set there. How do you think about the trajectory for you to reverse the trend there?", "Mike Brown", "Did you say to reverse the trend?", "Raimo Lenschow", "Reverse the -- start to stem the decline and then bring that back into growth again?", "Mike Brown", "You mean on the enterprise side I think is what your--", "Raimo Lenschow", "The enterprise side, at the early endpoint yes. Sorry", "Mike Brown", "I think the first thing I'd want to say is enterprise endpoint has been growing for us all year long, so I think we can do better there. I think when we think about the capabilities that we're bringing, especially with ATP, we see that as a big opportunity. As many of you all on the call have commented, 2016 is likely to be the renaissance of the endpoint, now that we're through a major refresh of firewalls, next-generation firewalls, many CISOs are turning to the endpoint because that's where unencrypted data live and that's where they are looking to be more effective against attacks. When we think about the combination of capabilities that we're offering, we think it's unparalleled in the marketplace.", "Just a couple of examples, we believe we're the only player effectively providing advanced attack protection across all vectors, so that's what our ATP solution does. You're really able to stop attacks and correlate them that might have been aimed at the network or email or endpoint, we could correlate those. The second, as I talked about in my remarks, we're using multiple advanced techniques that go well beyond static signatures, things like behavior monitoring, machine learning, global intelligence, advanced analytics.", "So we've already got multiple protection engines that are incorporated in step. The third would be the ability to remediate attacks; that comes with our ATP solution, so it's not just about protection but what can I due to remediate a situation. And then one of the things that Symantec has a strength in relative to some startup competitors is obviously delivering endpoint protection at scale without performance drag, because we can provide all these capabilities with a single agent.", "So we think we're really in an unmatched position now and adding the ATP capability gives us even stronger leadership. So we're still, as you'd expect, very excited about the endpoint. We think the capabilities we're adding with the ATP solutions really make us the leader again, in terms of the technology to protect, as well as remediate attacks at the endpoint.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Jerry Benatar [ph] in for Michael. Just staying on enterprise endpoint, what do you see customers doing in terms of their existing antivirus? Are they supplementing it with next-gen endpoint or are you seeing some churn there maybe? Thanks", "Mike Brown", "Thank you for that question, because I think this is the source of a lot of confusion about what's happening in the endpoint. There's a feeling that Symantec, as being a legacy vendor, really providing an antivirus protection and that's all. What's true is we're providing antivirus, but when I talk about multiple protection engines, antivirus is just one of those. We often call that signature-based technology or protection, but here's where we're adding those multiple layers.", "So we've spent years developing, through our advanced research, these multiple techniques to protect you so that we can see what attacks are frankly coming in across the network. So frankly, the capability that stops more attacks than antivirus is something called intrusion prevention that's really scanning what is the traffic coming in over the network. That blocks more attacks than antivirus today. And we combine that with other techniques that we talked about, behavior, we use wisdom of crowds to understand what are the reputations that endpoint users might go out to access other files or URL addresses.", "And again, the vast telemetry the we collect keeps reputations on those 25 billion files, 30 billion URLs. So we will block the user from going to an infected site or opening an infected file before they do that. So it's again, these multiple protection engines and techniques that allow us to provide that best protection at the end point. A lot of competitors like to think we're just antivirus, but it's far from the truth.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And could you also walk us through -- thinking behind the decision to go with the higher special dividend and reduce the regular dividend? Thanks.", "Thomas Seifert", "Yes, I think the special dividend is a reflection of returning the proceeds we received from Veritas transaction in a very efficient and timely manner to our shareholders. And we found and the Board found that the combination of the special dividend, combined with a buyback program, is going to achieve that in a very efficient manner. The reduction on the dividend is more a reflection on the operations and the size of the operations moving forward and keeping the operational flexibility to take care of what is in front of us in terms of adjusting our cost infrastructure, investing in the business.", "And then we said we're going to increase the dividend if cash flow allows for that. But I think those are two separate topics. One is the capital return, a very efficient capital return of the Veritas proceeds and the other position is around how we adjust to the smaller footprint. But keep in mind, we're still -- even the reduced dividend is still the majority of our domestically generated cash flow moving forward.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Weiss", "One top-line question and then one more strategic question. On the top-line question, focusing on the consumer side of the equation, it sounds like starting to trend in the right direction. Can you talk to us about how you guys are thinking about distribution on a going-forward basis. You're seeing good traction with the electronic distribution. Is there a potential of extending that back out into maybe putting your toe in the water, getting back into some of the OEM relationships?", "How should we think about how you're going to get the net new subscribers from here on out, how you're going to turn that ship fully around and actually start to get growth in the consumer side of the equation? That's the revenue question. Then the strategic question is just given the big chunk of cash return that's coming from Veritas, how does this impact how you guys think about M&A and the potential for doing deals on a going-forward basis? Does this have to steer you toward smaller deals versus something larger, given that you are giving back so much of this in cash?", "Mike Brown", "Keith, thanks for the question on consumer business, because it gives us an opportunity to say our goal is to get the -- return the consumer business to grow. And we think that is achievable over the long-term, meaning, over the next several years. So while we're not forecasting that for next year, as we continue to work through the transitions that we've already begun in the consumer business, we clearly see that as an opportunity, meaning returning the business to top-line revenue growth over a longer time frame. And distribution is a key part of that.", "Most important for us was making sure that we built a stronger foundation for the business. That had to do with reducing the churn rate and of course, what we've done primarily there is moved to a subscription. And what we're seeing as we're now reaching the one-year anniversary of customers who started in a subscription is that the retention rate of those customers is significantly higher than what we had before with an auto renewal program where they needed to proactively sign up year after year.", "So staying in a subscription, of course, means that they continue to be protected and pay us year after year without an opt in. And the retention rates are significantly higher, we're already seeing that in the business. That's important because that gives us a stronger model from which to approach OEMs. So if we had lower retention rates, higher churn rates, an OEM customer doesn't make as much back. So now that we're fixing the foundation in the business, meaning improving the retention rate, now there's an opportunity to think about expanding distribution.", "So today, we're primarily acquiring new customers through online acquisition. And Thomas talked about the fact we're up 8% year over year in terms of our online acquisitions. So one part of our channel growing there.", "The second part that's growing, from a channel perspective, is the new customers we're acquiring through large partners. These tend to be cable or telco companies and I talked in my remarks about the fact that a new opportunity for us there is monetizing mobile customers. We're starting to do that really for the first time. Then as we look at retail and OEM, OEM has been in decline for us, but now with a stronger model, it will be time for us to think about OEMs again. And in fact, we're competing for a major OEM contract this year.", "So we'll have to wait and see how that plays out, but with the stronger model, we'll be in a great position to be competitive there and have that be profitable to business for Symantec which of course, as we've talked about was different with some of those OEM contracts before. They weren't profitable for us and our churn rate was such that we weren't able to generate the right lifetime customer value.", "Moving on to your second question about our balance sheet and strategic flexibility, we do not believe that the capital return program limits our strategic flexibility in the least. As you are aware, we'll have a very strong balance sheet going forward. We estimate we will have something in the neighborhood of $5 billion in cash, as we end up FY '17,with strong cash-flow generating capabilities. We do not feel it limits our strategic flexibility and we're going to continue to think about what are the right other capabilities that we'd like to add to Symantec that are tightly aligned with this Unified Security strategy.", "Operator", "And we will go next to John DiFucci with Jefferies.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [indiscernible] on for John. Thanks for taking my question. If we could talk a little bit more about the enterprise business. Margins in that segment contracted a bit this quarter. How do you think about the potential for margin expansion there and balancing investing to drive growth, but also get to your corporate margin targets?", "Thomas Seifert", "I think I said it in my part that their slight decrease in enterprise margin, in part is a reflection of the higher burden of stranded costs that business had to carry this quarter and also to be honest, in FY '17. I think the $400 million cost improvement that we announced is going to be largely reflected in improvement in the margins of the enterprise security business, because Norton is already performing at a very profitable level and we've done our homework there already.", "You would expect that the margin for a standalone software business in this space is getting double-digit and I think with the improvement plans that we have put in place today and talked about today, this enables that path. And we get -- will get more specific when we talk about FY '17 guidance and beyond on our next earnings call. But without doubt, we have work in front of us, but we're serious about getting that done.", "Mike Brown", "I would just like to add that the stranded costs we talked about which start with some large legacy IT infrastructure and real estate, the large proportion of those of course would get allocated to the enterprise business, as Thomas said, get reflected in those margins. So it doesn't mean that we will be investing less and making the enterprise business the growth business. But we'll have to attack those costs which are now burdening that segment P&L.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And maybe one quick high-level follow up. Now being a pure-play security vendor and also having the very large install base that you have, you have unprecedented insight into the macro demand environment for security products. Can you talk a little bit and you touched on it, but could you go a little bit more in depth on the demand environment that you're seeing in calendar 2016 for security overall?", "Mike Brown", "We've seen no slowdown in terms of the demand for security products and services. They both have tremendous market opportunity. I think we would all agree that the market opportunity is a significant multiple of what we're showing in growth rate. The market opportunity we feel is there. Customers who have engaged with our strategy, seen our new products, are very excited about what they see.", "So I think our challenge is really how do we participate in that market growth to a greater extent? Which means better execution on our part, getting out these new products, making sure we're building the pipeline and that will allow us to grow the enterprise business a bit faster so that we're achieving more closely the market growth rate. But given the number and severity of attacks that we see with the global intelligence network that we have, there's no slowdown in terms of the attackers or attacks and customers continue to reach out saying they need help with this problem.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Pat Walravens with JMP.", "Pat Walravens", "Mike, I was hoping you could talk just a little bit about M&A and how you're thinking about it. And in particular, what valuation guidelines you guys use as you evaluate opportunities? Because that's an area of concern I hear from investor sometimes, that you're going to spend all the money on something that's super expensive.", "Mike Brown", "We hear those same concerns. I hope today's announcement of a capital return program alleviates some of those concerns, as we've now returned all the proceeds or in process of returning all the proceeds of the Veritas transaction to shareholders, because I think that was a concern. As I said before, when Keith and I were talking though, we don't feel this limits our flexibility in terms of looking at potential acquisitions down the road. We have a very strong balance sheet and strong cash flow. But we will be very judicious as we think about this. If you look at our track record for the last 18 months or so, we've only done two small acquisitions.", "Those were very tightly aligned with the strategy that we've talked about, meaning they significantly add to the Unified Security. And in part, that was because we saw that the valuations were such that it was very difficult to make an acquisition, have the right level of returns for ourselves and our shareholders. We're going to continue to be very judicious as we think about what are the right assets that need to be tightly aligned with the strategy and they need to make financial sense over a similar timeframe, meaning a couple year time frame for us. It can't be something that's going to pay off 10 years from now.", "One of the additional capabilities we'll have now is Silver Lakes' extensive capability in assessing companies. They are interested in helping us with this issue as well, both from the standpoint of looking at the opportunities, but also in making sure that we understand the targets that we're looking at in depth.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard", "Quick question, one just on the capital return I just want to make sure I understand how you fund it, because I do understand you're returning all the dollar amount of the proceeds from Veritas but not all those are in the U.S.. Should we expect you to raise incremental debt or do you intend to repatriate some of the funds that coming in from the Veritas deal?", "Thomas Seifert", "A good question, Walter. When we talk about the special dividend that is going to be paid in March and also the first step in the buyback program that we announced, if you consider how much domestic cash we have after the Veritas proceeds, then add the money that we get from Silver Lake, we're in good shape to cover that first step.", "On top of that, there's operational cash flow and then there will be some additional debt involved during the full way, at least until we can bridge a more efficient way to repatriate capital. But I think this is something where we have not crossed all Ts and dotted all I's, that is work that is in process. But I think for the first step, the special dividend and the first step towards an efficient buyback in starting already in the fourth quarter. If you look at the domestic cash on hand, we're in good shape to do that.", "Walter Pritchard", "And then one other question for you, just on the billings, you gave the billings number ex-Veritas for the December period. Could you provide the comparable billings for the prior year or maybe just the growth rate or constant currency growth rate, something to help us put that in context?", "Thomas Seifert", "I understand that request. There is a lot of [indiscernible] to be done separating the Veritas numbers and the Symantec new numbers on a historical perspective. And as those numbers -- historical numbers become available, we'll be able to talk about it. Since we just closed the transaction the better part of a week ago, we're not there yet in terms of providing historical numbers.", "Walter Pritchard", "Just maybe at a higher level, your revenue was down about 2% on the security side. Is it safe to say that your -- whatever measure of what you're thinking that business is growing, is it in that range or did -- I don't necessarily need a billings number calculated exactly but is it something you can give us [indiscernible] what those business did?", "Thomas Seifert", "I think if you look at it from a bookings -- or from a billings perspective, we have outperformed revenue growth in the third quarter. Let's leave it there.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew Nowinski", "I just have a follow-up to the macro question prior. You constantly hear about how enterprises are losing the battle against hackers and as you said, there's no slowdown in breaches. However, are you guys seeing any shift in priorities within the broader spending environment?", "Mike Brown", "I would say that the shift that we're seeing is towards how can you integrate some of the capabilities as opposed to buying more and more point solutions. Many of our customers are saying, I'm overwhelmed with the number of point solutions that are out there, people coming to me saying they've got a clever new way to block this single exploit. Or what can we do that might help stop one type of attacks and they are looking for something that's a more integrated solution here. How do I get a view across my enterprise? How do I protect myself knowing that there are threats that might have occurred in another part of the world aimed at the same vertical that I am in? That's where I think our strategy is really resonating.", "So if you think about what we described with ATP, we're giving customers a view across their entire enterprise and then we're giving them access to the global threat intelligence that we have. We're finding that customers are looking for that ability to find a needle in the haystack. How do I see that attack? If I'm a bank that's occurred in an Australian bank today, because the attackers are trying to leverage their business model, but really they are just replicating whatever attacks that worked with another vertical, another part of the world.", "So that's where I think the Symantec intelligence network really pays off. And then for individual customers, not only that, but again, how do I get an integrated view versus I don't want to be the integrator of 50 different technologies. Those are some of the trends that we're seeing.", "Andrew Nowinski", "And then just a quick follow-up on the recent launch for your ATP products, I know you said it was only available for 30 days in the quarter. But does it have any revenue impact in the quarter?", "Mike Brown", "There was revenue impact, a small one. Obviously, we wouldn't call that material for the December quarter, but we're thinking that's going to be a 10 X improvement as we look into the March quarter. And the pipeline is building rapidly. Again, the reason for that is, number one, we're looking at the install base as the opportunity. And we have this idea, I talked about, of focused sales plays where we're out talking to those customers who are going to be renewing email or endpoint. And we've spent so much time with partners educating them about the solution. They're starting to be a multiplier effect, even though it's very early days.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.", "Gray Powell", "Obviously, there are a lot of one-time costs impacting free cash flow this year. How should we think about the normalized free cash flow margin in FY '16 for security? And then if operating margins improve over the next couple of years, what kind of flow-through should we expect at the free cash flow line? Thanks.", "Thomas Seifert", "I have waited for this question until we give guidance for FY '17. We had a lot of moving parts with the separation and the restructuring cost. Also CapEx impacted us on the separation side really, being able to separate that, especially the IT infrastructure. So a normalized operating cash flow number, globally is probably in the neighborhood of $700 million. And then we will have to look at FY '17, the gives and takes that are coming from putting a more efficient capital structure in place, that will have an impact and also how we approach the cost reduction of $400 million is going to have an impact on that number.", "So there will be a baseline and we'll have to make gives and takes on that number. And then as we generate and make progress on the $400 million cost reductions, that will be a significant tailwind moving forward. I think the run rate number I gave is a good run rate number. And then we'll be more precise at our next earnings call, because I think by then, we understand really what the gives and takes are going to be over the FY '17.", "Mike Brown", "Probably the tailwind, it'd fair to say, Thomas, will be really heavy at the end of the year. Certainly second two quarters; I wouldn't expect as many in the first quarter.", "Operator", "And we will take one last question from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow", "Just wanted to focus in on the consumer commentary you gave there about getting back to growth. And obviously you outperformed your expectations this quarter. You talked about distribution, but what are the puts and takes that you see there longer term and getting that back to growth? And then also in what margin context do you think about that?", "Mike Brown", "If you think about the broader macro environment, the PC market we're all reading is declining. So what we view this in is that the install base is growing, but growing slowly at this point, so that's the broader context. Now an opportunity for us is to move beyond traditional PC form factor into mobile.", "We talked about that a bit today. We also talked about additional products that we can add the used Norton's capabilities. We talked about other capabilities like privacy in the home, like what we could do for IoT as we protect other devices in the home. I think there are other product opportunities that go beyond the traditional PC form factor, but the overwhelming proportion of our business today obviously is PC.", "And then as we look at the changes we've made in Norton which are primarily from a channel perspective, significant declines in OEM and retail as we focused on online acquisition and partners. Now that we have a stronger model, as we discussed earlier which means higher lifetime customer value that we achieved by moving people to subscription, we can look again at where does it make sense to grow in retail and OEM. In fact, retail for the regions outside of North America is already growing again.", "We don't have that growing in North America, but that's something that we have as a goal for this coming year. And then we talked about earlier in the call, given the strength of the model, we can also look at OEMs as well. So I'm quite optimistic that over the long term, there are enough opportunities for Norton to be able to grow. It's just going to take us a little while to realize those opportunities.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference.

(Broker)", "Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to Symantec's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Doros - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 earnings results. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review our earnings release and supplemental information. We've also posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations Events webpage. Speakers on today's call are: Mike Brown, Symantec's CEO; Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via our webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. Implied billings refer to revenue plus the change in sequential deferred revenue excluding the portion of Veritas deferred revenue.", "We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks, except for statements about net income and EPS. Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 3, 2015.", "All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However, continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations.", "As a result, implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred on the balance sheet will not represent standalone Symantec's performance, as it will include an impact from Veritas.", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Mike Brown. Go ahead, Mike.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jonathan.", "As many of you know, we provided preliminary fourth quarter results on April 28, and also announced that I will step down once our next CEO starts. Last November, as we entered the second half of Symantec's three-year transformation, we outlined four priorities. First, delivering new products that leverage our unified security strategy. Second, building our go-to-market capabilities in Enterprise Security. Third, further improving our cost structure to eliminate stranded costs from the Veritas transaction, and going further, to achieve 30%-plus operating margins in fiscal year 2018. And fourth, continuing to efficiently allocate capital.", "I'll cover our progress and plans on the first two of these. Thomas will cover in more detail, the cost structure improvement work, and updates to our capital allocation.", "Let's start with a view of the threat environment, and then I'll share how our unified security strategy addresses what we're seeing. The threat environment continues to obstruct enterprise's ability to efficiently conduct business, and will cost our global economy in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion, annually. To combat this, Chief Information Security Officers are looking to standardize on integrated security platforms, which incorporate visibility, fast remediation, and analytics to secure their environment from advanced threats and manage more cloud-based workloads.", "Through our unified security strategy, Symantec is bringing to market a wave of organically developed solutions to provide our customers with four key capabilities. One, visibility into a broader view of the threats. Two, automating repetitive tasks that security operations analysts face, as well as enable these professionals to remediate threats, not just monitor alerts. Three, protecting more cloud-based workloads through our new Security-as-a-Service offering, as well as provide visibility and protection to these workloads through our information protection solution. And four, accessing Symantec's global intelligence network in real-time to help understand which of the eight trillion objects we're monitoring are threats to that customer's environment.", "Many companies offer the potential of security analytics, but only Symantec offers an unparalleled amount of data, upon which to run these analytics. Many of the network security vendors in the market today, such as FireEye and Palo Alto, only provide threat protection offerings, these offerings are focused on keeping bad actors out of the network, and do not provide protection for the data itself.", "Symantec combines the power of threat protection to keep bad actors out, plus offerings we call information protection to secure the data and authenticate users. These information protection offerings are DLP, encryption, identity and access management and user behavior analytics.", "The combined power of our threat protection and information protection offerings along with Symantec's global intelligence network is our platform for not only protecting customers against threats, but also authenticating users and protecting critical data. Symantec is the only security company with a platform this broad, or with the access to this much global real time data on which to run analytics.", "With our new offerings this year, we will bring more of the power of this platform approach to customers to provide more secure outcomes. The first of our new offerings to leverage this unified security strategy is our ATP solution, which consists of ATP Endpoint, ATP Email, and ATP Network.", "Our ATP management console provides a single pane of glass that correlates threats across our network, endpoint and email solutions to determine the highest impact threats to an organization, and provide fast remediation. In addition, our ATP solution leverages the Symantec global intelligence network to spot threats that have affected any of our global base of 370,000 enterprise customers, and 65 million consumers to stop these threats from spreading.", "In future releases of ATP, we plan to provide a complete set of third-party APIs and integrations into other major security products. We expect this third-party functionality to be released during our current fiscal year, and will include out-of-the-box integration to major SIEM, network, and IT ticketing/workflow products to help customers leverage their existing security investments.", "Additionally, we will be adding an agentless endpoint detection and response capability that will enable us to sell ATP into environments with competitors' endpoint products. In other words, ATP will work with competitor endpoints to provide advanced protection and triple our addressable market for this ATP solution.", "In fiscal 2017, beyond ATP, we will launch additional new and organically developed offerings, which leverage our unified security strategy: first, Symantec Unified Endpoint Protection, a fully SaaS based endpoint security and management solution aimed at small and midsize enterprises; second, Data Center Security .cloud, a fully cloud-based solution to discover and automatically secure cloud workloads on AWS and Azure; and third, the next version of Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP, which will include further enhancements in areas such as cloud-based detection, proactive exploit protection, and machine learning.", "As mentioned before, Symantec is unique in the industry in providing information protection solutions as part of its platform to protect data as it travels from on-premise to the cloud. In order to provide visibility into the movement of this data and these cloud-based workloads, Symantec combines its industry-leading data loss prevention and user authentication solutions.", "During fiscal 2017, we plan to release additional DLP cloud enhancements for cloud services such as Box, OneDrive, and salesforce.com, and user authentication enhancements for continuous and proximity-based authentication. We are already selling DLP cloud for Office 365 and Gmail. Additionally, we authenticate over 1 billion devices a year and provide millions of users with multiple factor authentication without the need for passwords.", "Beyond our threat protection and information protection offering, the third part of our portfolio is Cyber Security Services, which monitor third-party offerings as well as our own products in customer environments, making this service a source of additional data about the threat landscape, while this service also benefits from our global intelligence network.", "As a result, these offerings also leverage our unified security strategy. We help customers during every stage of the attack lifecycle by providing the security and threat intelligence expertise required to protect customers' environments since security expertise is so scarce.", "Now let's talk about the second of those four transformation priorities, building our Enterprise Security pipeline by improving our go-to-market capability. During fiscal 2016, we reenergized our brand to focus solely on cybersecurity, aligned marketing dollars against dedicated sales plays, and went to market with security-only sales professionals.", "Given the number of our new offerings coming, we are building a robust pipeline with our direct sales force and our channel complemented by new marketing efforts. We are investing in a more powerful lead generation engine to improve the quality of the pipeline marketing is delivering to sales. We are adding 20% more quota-carrying field reps without increasing our sales spend by reducing further sales overhead.", "We are also continuing to focus on channel partners with more security expertise through our award-winning Secure One program that certifies our partners on our products and provides better rewards for those partners that focus on Symantec.", "However, we also saw that during the fourth quarter, our new business mix was weighted towards subscription and ratable-type contracts relative to on-premise licenses. Considering the cloud-based nature of the new products we are bringing to market, the majority of these products will be sold as subscriptions.", "Beyond the changing cloud-based mix of our new products, customer buying preferences for our existing products are shifting to deals with more subscriptions or ratable revenue, to lower their capital expenditures and provide increased security as a variable operating expense. We expect this trend toward more subscriptions to continue, and as a result, we will see a headwind to the year-over-year comparisons for our in-period license revenue, which will be offset by a corresponding tailwind to deferred revenue. Thomas will further outline this business model transition in more detail in his remarks.", "Now, let me provide an overview to our fourth quarter results, which reflect this shift to less in-period license revenue and more subscriptions sold. Enterprise security revenue was down 4% driven by declines in both threat protection and information protection that were offset by growth in Cyber Security Services and other services.", "Within threat protection, Endpoint Security again grew in total. ATP performed especially well during its first full quarter of availability, as we sold over 1.2 million ATP subscriptions with a number of high-profile wins across verticals. This initial penetration represents just a fraction of our total Symantec Endpoint Protection installed base.", "We are seeing pricing for ATP Endpoint well in excess of 100% of current SEP recurring revenue as we sell an ATP subscription for a multiple of our SEP renewal subscription. We already have a fiscal 2017 sales pipeline of well over $100 million for ATP across a variety of industries and customer sizes.", "Within information protection, DLP revenue for Q4 declined 5%. The Q4 DLP decline was mainly the result of more new business shifting to subscription versions of DLP and lower than expected close rates of large DLP deals. For fiscal year 2016, DLP grew 13%.", "CSS revenue grew in the quarter 5%, and new business activity measured by billings increased at double-digit percentage rates. In the second half of 2016, we witnessed improved execution across our services business through the addition of sales specialists and our Cyber One offering. Cyber One provides the value of our CSS solutions in one comprehensive offering; our monitored service, incident response, threat intelligence and simulation training.", "Revenue from our Website Security offerings to protect e-commerce grew 1%. During the fourth quarter, significantly we launched Encryption Everywhere, which is a freemium offering available through web hosting providers to integrate entry-level encryption into every website. We expect Encryption Everywhere to enable us to grow our unit market share dramatically and generate revenue upside from a range of security solution as we convert newly-acquired free customers to premium website services.", "Moving to our Consumer Security business, the underlying fundamentals of our Consumer business continue to improve driven by the move to subscriptions, as well as acquiring new customers online and through partners, rather than through OEMs. Later this year we will expand our opportunity through new consumer upsell offerings for Wi-Fi privacy and identity theft protection.", "As of March 2016, over 95% of customers in the U.S. were enrolled in Norton subscriptions and renewed automatically. In line with our expectations, we saw higher year-over-year retention rates in March and April. By this fall, customers worldwide will be renewing their Norton subscriptions automatically as we reach the one-year anniversary of transitioning customers to our subscription service in Europe and Japan. We continue to grow our online acquisition of customers, which grew 10% during the fourth quarter, and 15% for the full year.", "Norton Mobile offerings sold through our telco partners grew 67% in Q4; and 50% for the fiscal year. This growth did not include any impact from the Indian Telco we announced last quarter, where we expect to begin generating revenue during this fiscal year.", "For fiscal year 2017, we continue to expect the Consumer revenue declines to moderate to down 6% to down 3%, and be able to maintain operating margins in the low to mid-50%s. And for fiscal year 2018, these declines will moderate further.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Thomas.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Mike. Today, I'll provide a brief review of our fourth quarter results and capital structure, expand upon the key areas of our $400 million efficiency improvement program, outline our shifting business model and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our investor relation website.", "Fourth quarter total revenue was $873 million, a decline of 6%. The U.S. dollar strengthened slightly against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of approximately $3 million to fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis.", "Deferred revenue was $2.6 billion, which includes $330 million deferred revenue from Veritas. Implied billings excluding Veritas were $1 billion and grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and benefited from a tailwind from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25%, and fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22.", "Turning to cash flow, cash flow from continuing operating activities for the March quarter totaled $1.2 billion, and include $74 million in outflows related to restructuring and separation costs, and a $900 million benefit from taxes payable related to gain on the sale on Veritas. In regards to this payable, we will pay approximately $900 million in cash taxes on June 15.", "In line with our previous capital structure plans, and in order to maintain flexibility in our capital structure, while returning significant capital to shareholders, we recently closed a $2 billion credit facility. $1 billion of this facility is a term loan, which we fully borrowed at close. The loan matures in three years, and is pre-payable. The remaining $1 billion is a five-year revolving credit facility, and replaces our existing $1 billion revolving credit agreement. As a reminder, we've returned $4 billion of the Veritas proceeds, and we will return $1.3 billion by the end of the current fiscal year.", "Moving on to our $400 million cost efficiency program. As you can see from our segment results, the Consumer Security business operates at a solid margin in the low to mid-50%s. Within the Enterprise Security segment, our Website Security products are over 95% recurring revenue, and operate at a healthy operating margin above our corporate average. As a result, the savings that result from our efficiency plan will mainly benefit our Enterprise Security products. Our net $400 million efficiency program is composed of savings across stranded costs from the Veritas divestiture, procurement, organizational effectiveness, real estate and Enterprise Security portfolio simplification.", "Let me quantify the approximate savings we expect to realize from each of these areas. First, TSAs and stranded costs across IT and other shared services left over from the divestiture of Veritas. In total, we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of savings from eliminating these costs.", "Second, procurement. We are tightening our focus on how we spend across the more than $1 billion of products and services we consume. We have identified over $100 million in procurement savings that we are in the process of achieving.", "Third, we are improving our organizational efficiency to remove layers of management, consolidate operations, and rebalance some positions to lower cost regions. These changes to the organization will result in just under $100 million in savings and reduce our net head count by approximately 1,200 positions.", "Fourth, we expect to improve our real estate utilization by 25%, which will result in an estimated savings of approximately $35 million.", "And finally, we are streamlining our spending within our Enterprise Security product portfolio to invest in solutions that accelerate our unified security strategy. As part of this initiative, we are reducing the number of SKUs and we are improving how we deliver our technology to customers. We expect to achieve approximately $50 million of savings from this initiative.", "As part of our $400 million in net savings, we'll be taking a $230 million to $280 million charge in restructuring to our GAAP results over the next two years. Of the $400 million in reductions, we expect just over 50% to be realized in fiscal year 2017 on a run-rate basis. And this enables us to enter fiscal year at an operating margin of 30%.", "Let me now provide an overview of our Enterprise Security performance during the fourth quarter, and some insight into our shift to more subscription and ratable revenue.", "Enterprise Security revenue declined 4%, as a shift in customer buying preferences resulted in less license revenue during the quarter, and more revenue being deferred to future periods. This included a faster than expected shift within our product mix to subscription and ratable contract structures.", "Specifically, the move to a more ratable mix resulted in just over a $30 million revenue shortfall relative to our internal forecast, but our deferred revenue overachieved by a similar amount. This provides a tailwind to our fiscal 2017 revenue outlook.", "However, we expect the trend of lower in-period license revenue to continue. And as a result, we expect a headwind to billings and revenue growth that will vary depending on the speed of this transition. Underlying this shift, we'll still see solid demand for our solutions and expect sustainable long-term top line growth for our Enterprise Security solutions.", "Now, turning to the outlook, we expect Q1 revenue to be down 6% to down 3%, operating margin of 24.5% to 26.5%, and EPS of $0.24 to $0.26. For Q2, we expect revenue growth and margins to be similar to Q1, and improve in the second half of 2017 as we benefit from the deferred revenue tailwind of more ratable revenue and start to see the results from our efficiency program. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be down 4% to down 1%, from a segment standpoint. We expect fiscal year 2017 Consumer Security revenue of down 6% to down 3%, and Enterprise Security revenue to be down 2% to flat.", "Fiscal 2017 operating margins and EPS are expected to be 26.5% to 27.5%, and EPS between $1.06 to $1.10, respectively. In summary, when you put all of these changes together, we believe that fiscal year 2018 will be a much stronger year, both for top line growth and for improved profitability.", "As we enter fiscal 2018, we expect total revenue performance to improve as we benefit from the declines in the Consumer business moderating to down low single-digits. The shift in more subscription and ratable revenue will provide a growth tailwind to our Enterprise Security business, and from a profitability standpoint, we expect to enter fiscal year 2018 at 30% operating margins, and for the full fiscal year of 2018, we expect operating margins of 33%.", "In conclusion, our Consumer Security top line declines are moderating and profitability remains solid. Our Enterprise Security segment is in the early innings of the most robust organic product cycle in the company's history, and at the same time we're focused on improving the profitability of the Enterprise Security business to drive long-term value for our shareholders.", "Jonathan Doros - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. We'll now take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, thanks for taking my question. I have two quick questions, if you're okay with that. First one is, if you look at the drivers for the Enterprise Security business that you laid out for 2017, can you talk a little bit more about those? Because at the moment, so I get the \u2013 and I get licenses going through being suffering, deferred is going to be better, but then you have that as an ongoing theme. So are we flying blind a little bit because we don't know what's going on, or can you help us a little bit understand on the different puts and takes there? And then I have a follow-up, please.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Let me take that question. We're not flying blind like many other enterprise software security companies. We are dealing with similar changes in how new products are sold and how buying preferences are changing. That should not be a surprise. We have seen the first impacts of that in Q4, and we try to anticipate that with the guidance we give for fiscal year 2017.", "Fiscal year 2017, if you compare original expectations to where our guidance is now, I think there are three moving parts. For sure there is a deferred revenue tailwind from our performance in Q4. We said, we overachieved our deferred revenue expectations by about $30 million. That is a tailwind moving into 2017 for sure. We have adjusted our assumptions on product mix and yield and the linearity we see because of that. And we put some conservative up on the numbers to make sure that this transition is predictable from a communication perspective. If I had to give color, then that is probably a 70:30 mix in terms of the factors that I just talked about.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Raimo, maybe if I could just add, if you step back and look from the model changes as we talked about, we're extremely enthused about the new products that are coming. And of course, we're getting a second year now of a focused marketing and sales effort on security-only. So we've learned a little bit from what we did this year, and we're making those improvements that I talked about in my prepared remarks as we go into 2017. So I think the overall strength of the portfolio is improving.", "I think if you were to look at the business separate from this model shift to increasing subscriptions and ratable business, you'd see continued strength. In fact, we saw the Enterprise Security business in total up about 1% for each of the quarters this year. If you modeled in the revenue, if it had appeared in-period in Q4 versus going on the balance sheet in deferred, you'd see a similar trend for Q4. And we expect the strength of those new products, the market demand for what we're doing, and the improvements in go-to-market would result in similar improvements as we go into FY 2017. But the guidance that we give now reflects what we're seeing in terms of this shift in the customers' buying preference, and of course the shift in our offerings being more cloud-based.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, that helps, and then a question on the Consumer side. Now that you have more guys on subscription in the U.S. and then they're turning into Europe, et cetera as well, what's the story around the OEM business? You mentioned on the call, you have less business from OEM because your other demand drivers are working. But should you not be able to monetize the OEM channel better given that your customer lifetime value should be better with subscription?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's exactly right. So as we look at the business today, we're still seeing declines from the OEM channel. So of our total customer mix, OEM is a much smaller proportion. That's what we reflected in the prepared remarks. However, you're correct. If we look at the customer lifetime value, given the higher retention rates, we have higher lifetime values for customers, which will allow us to be more competitive as we look at OEMs that we might want to bring on in the future, and we are having those discussions now. But as we've said so many times in the past, this isn't about adding revenue as fast as possible. It's really about making sure that revenue is profitable. So we're not going to be quick to jump into any deal that doesn't look attractive to us.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Did I see something in the guidance...", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Let me add to that. I think the strength and the changes in the business model are really that we are interacting with our customers directly. And I think this direct access and communication with our customers has helped us to rebuild the business model and get to the subscription and enrollment rates we enjoy today.", "We always have to be aware that an OEM deal is an indirect model to get to business, and that's why what Mike said is so important. For us adding and keeping the profitability and the health of the business segments, we have worked hard to achieve that, is key. That doesn't mean that we do not engage into OEM deals, but they have to be well thought through, and they have to add to the model we've put in place.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think you might have been going rather to the question of whether the guidance included any OEM deals, and the answer to that is no.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We've assumed no OEM deals in the guidance we talked about.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Good afternoon, thanks a lot. I just have a few questions for you. First, I think you said you're seeing ATP pricing well in excess of 100% of your current SEP recurring revenue. Is that pricing all incremental to your SEP recurring revenue, or is that more of a replacement?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, it's incremental. So we're seeing a number of factors when we're selling ATP, Andrew. The first is that we're seeing the SEP maintenance pricing or the renewal pricing hold much more firmly, so that's a positive. We're seeing the renewal rates for SEP improve. And in some cases, we're able to expand our footprint as customers are expanding the number of SEP endpoints that are under protection; so those are all three very positive trends.", "And then additionally, we sell ATP as a subscription, which we're selling for multiples of what the SEP, or SEP, renewal rate is. So it's at least 100%, and in many cases much bigger factor than that. So when you put that all together, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing, both with the adoption of ATP, and with what the revenue uplift can be.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Okay, got it. Thanks, and then just a quick question on your sales capacity. I think you said you're adding 20% more quota-carrying field sales reps, but can you give us any color on how your sales force was structured maybe even prior to the sale of Veritas? I guess, what I'm trying to understand is, did you lose sales reps as part of that split so that net increase to the sales force is less than 20%? Or are you actually giving us of the net increase there with the 20%?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, it's a net increase. So of course we separated the sales force, but that happened at the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Veritas and Symantec, so we're saying relative to the base we started with in FY 2016, we've now added 20% more quota-carrying. And we're doing that by just adjusting the mix of what folks are doing within sales, so fewer folks in sales that were non-quota-carrying. We were adjusting that down to give more capacity in the field itself.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Got it, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, thanks for taking my questions. I had another question on your Consumer business. It sounds like you're not assuming any real uplift from OEMs. I'm also curious; to what extent could you talk to us about your renewal assumptions embedded in that guidance? And then maybe you've talked about this Indian telco deal before. Do you assume any uplift from that deal kind of in your down 6% to down 3%, guide?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "From which deal, did he say?", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "The Indian telco.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The Indian telco. Yes, so you're correct, we're not assuming any OEM deals in the guidance, so the guidance would change if we do an OEM deal. We haven't really given renewal rates as you know for the Consumer business, but we have seen a dramatic improvement for those customers who are already on the subscription. They renew automatically, there's no \u2013 what we used to call an auto-renewal process.", "So if someone's credit card is current, they basically get notified that their subscription is continuing and they don't need to take any action. And as with so many Consumer products that we're all familiar with, the retention rates for those customers in a subscription is so much higher. So we're seeing the benefit of that. We commented that we particularly saw that in March and April, as we're now seeing the one-year anniversary of when we moved those customers into subscription. And then the Indian telco that we announced, which is one of the examples of monetizing mobile protection for consumers, we expect that to contribute to FY 2017's revenue for Norton.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then for Thomas, can you help us with your cash flow assumptions from ops next year? I know, you guys have talked about, kind of, I believe a $700 million rate ex one-time items. Is that kind of the right way to think about cash flow from ops next year?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'd say yes, the $700 million is still the right baseline. Before we hit the one-time impacts like from restructuring, we just talked about the restructuring charge we expect to incur over the next two years, $230 million to $280 million. It will not be exactly even across the two years, so you would have to be \u2013 expect a little bit more front-end loaded, 60% in the first year, 40% in the second year, but net of these effects, there's a natural run rate of $700 million in the near-term, and then improving once we take full benefit of the $400 million of cost reduction.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question. I wanted to dig into the Symantec Endpoint Protection business and the impacts on the competitive environment that you've seen from now having the new ATP solution out there. One of the better cases around Symantec has been these Next Generation Endpoint vendors are starting to wear away at the base, so I guess a two-part question. One, can you comment on how well that base is sustaining? And two, does the new product change that competitive dynamic at all?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Keith. We're seeing that our Endpoint Protection is holding up quite well, in fact growing as I mentioned, even in the face of some other parts of the portfolio that are declining, so we continue very enthused about how SEP is doing. And I think that's because many of these other Endpoint Protection companies out there, one, require you to put an additional agent on to get a level of protection, and two, are boasting about some level of protection that goes beyond antivirus.", "Symantec's Endpoint Protection or SEP already has that. We already, as we've talked about so many times before, we are already putting multiple protection engines into the SEP capability, and we continue to add to that.", "In fact, one of the 12 new products that I've talked about, coming for this fiscal year that started with ATP is the next generation of our SEP offering, which includes, as we talked about, some of those key capabilities, more detection in the cloud, which shift some of the workload to the cloud versus the agent itself, makes it so much more efficient; Proactive Exploit Protection, which gives us the ability to see different behaviors of malware and block those by understanding how those typically manifest themselves; and then more advanced machine learning. So we continue to improve on what SEP is capable of doing.", "We kind of think about next generation as having a couple of key aspects. One, are you providing advanced protection beyond AV? We're already doing that today, have been doing it for years. Many of these new competitors are, as I said, crowing about one slice of what's required in protection, that's beyond AV.", "The second would be, what can you protect across different control points? Can you control for threats that would come in across email, across the network and across endpoint? Obviously our ATP capability does that. What can you do to remediate threats? So do you have EDR capability? Then the fourth, very importantly, can you scale to hundreds of thousands of endpoints without affecting performance? So we believe in fact that Symantec is the only vendor that can provide all four of those in what we call Next Generation Endpoint Protection.", "And then I'll just point to the third-party view, in February, we announced that pretty rigorous testing organization, AV-TEST, gave us the number one award on Consumer and Enterprise, it was the first time that was ever given to the same company, with 20 different endpoint providers were tested, and we came out number one, blocking more threats effectively with fewer false positives. So we believe we've got third parties verifying what we're saying about Endpoint Protection from Symantec.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's helpful. And then just one follow-up; in terms of sort of the outlook, you guys now have some additional lending capacity, how should we think about your view on M&A on a going-forward basis? Part of the purview of Symantec is to pull more security under the umbrella. Does that include M&A in the near-term? Or is it mostly going to be on the back of organic development?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I would say, primary in our thinking is organic development. You could see that's where our emphasis has been. M&A is clearly not the solution to getting Symantec growing again. Having said that, I think we've been very upfront that we have been, and we'll continue to look at M&A opportunities. They need to fit very tightly with the strategy we've talked about, and they need to make sense, financially. And you can see by looking at our history that we've been very careful as we've thought about opportunities. There's been no shortage of things to look at, but we're very strict with our criteria.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Excellent. Thank you very much, guys.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Keith.", "Operator", "We'll now go next to John DiFucci with Jefferies.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you. It seems you were surprised at the customer uptake of subscription-based products or their buying behaviors. I'm just curious. Are there any other things that are surprising you now that you're seeing in the market in terms of customer buying patterns, either something more challenging for you or even something more beneficial?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd say we think that this trend towards more subscriptions business is going to be beneficial for us in the long run. It provides a headwind near term, but we think it's obviously going to make us much more predictable long term, and we think it frankly will provide more staying power with existing customers by getting them on a subscription basis, the same way we're already seeing that benefit in the Norton business. So I'd say as we have invested in our portfolio to bring some solutions out that are more cloud-based, we expect that to directly coincide with customer buying preferences.", "The other key trend I'd say is a real positive for us is the increased focus on the endpoint. As networks become more porous, there are more cloud-based workloads, there's less emphasis on next-generation firewall. That doesn't mean they're not going to be important or that those vendors are not going to be successful, but we're seeing that there's more of an emphasis on what can you do to protect those workloads in the cloud. Even with those workloads in the cloud, endpoint still has to be protected, and then that also lends some tailwind to our information protection offerings, which clearly are very beneficial for customers that are doing workloads in the cloud.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, Mike. If I might follow up, it goes with that endpoint comment. It seems like in security anyway, from observation, it doesn't seem like anything really goes away, but we get more and more technologies. And Symantec has been a company for years now and not the only one that says listen, we have to help our customers to integrate this.", "And there's some talk out there of some companies trying to provide everything as a platform, and there's also talk that maybe that's not the best way to go, and so there's little bit of debate out there. But the real problem here is the customer needs something because it seems like it's getting \u2013 and when I talk to customers anyway, they just want someone to bring it all together for them, and it just seems like it's just too difficult to do.", "But you said something about the agentless ATP functionality that's going to work in concert with others' endpoint. I find that really interesting. Is there any work right now being done within Symantec that is still trying to pull everything together, whoever's products those are, whether those I guess peers and sometimes competitors are working with you or not necessarily working with you? Is this just a pipe dream, or is this something you think can still really happen?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's a bit of a mixed bag, John. I think, thinking you're going to get everything all under one console is a bit of a pipe dream, and the reason is because the problem becomes ever more complex. The attack surface, when you consider mobile, cloud-based, IoT, any of the productivity enhancing trends in IT bring their own security issues along with it. So as the attack surface expands, it's difficult to think I'm going to consolidate everything under one pane of glass.", "However, one of the key thrusts behind our unified security strategy, and we talked about our platform approach, is to bring more of that visibility under a single pane of glass. I talked in my prepared remarks about how we're doing that with ATP. I think in the future, you could see our threat protection and information protection be brought together under one pane of glass, and that's much broader than anyone else in the industry, in our view, has the capability to do. So pipe dream to think it's all going to happen and it's going to happen near term, but we are clearly moving in that direction.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Great.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Also our capability, Mike talked in his prepared remarks that we will provide APIs to put our ATP on top of other competitors' endpoints. I think that certainly a move from our perspective in this direction of having more visibility in one console and providing visibility to our customers, even if the traditional endpoint protection is not coming from us.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right, perfect example.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you, John.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. I'm wondering if you could help us understand on billings for next year. It seems like almost revenue is becoming difficult to use as a basis to see how you're performing in the business, in this year where you have the significant transition going on. Any guidance around billings or anything directional relative to what you're growing billings right now for next year?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We talked about our implied billings performance in Q4. I think it's also fair to say that, if we follow the arguments and the trends and cycles we outlined over this fiscal year 2017, we expect to enter fiscal year 2018 with a deferred revenue balance that's going to be up year over year, reflecting the shift in a more ratable structure. So we expect our deferred revenue balance for ES to be up 3% to 5%. I think that gives you an indication of the direction which we are going. And we will, over the course of the Q1 and Q2, move ourselves in a position where we can report better and more detailed billings data moving forward.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then for \u2013 I'm not sure for which one of you, but on the ES business, could you talk about what percentage of that business you see as a growth business versus how much of that business is still a business where you'll have to work through headwinds in 2017 and possibly 2018 as parts of that may still decline?", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think we've talked historically about the fact that 60% of the portfolio is growing and about 40% is declining. We talked about the key areas. If we look over the year, certainly our SEP, Endpoint Security has been growing. We've seen DLP grow at some very fast rates. We saw that up double digit for the year, even though it was down for the quarter. We're going to expect to see obviously fast growth in these new offerings. We saw that with ATP. We've got a number of new cloud offerings coming. We've got the first analytics applications coming for unified security, so a number of key growth areas.", "What we've talked about declining is Endpoint Management. So that's about $100 million business now for us. It's been in decline for some time. One of the new offerings which we're calling the Unified Endpoint Management and Security is going to essentially replace, because it incorporates both Security Policy Management, as well as the traditional Endpoint Management or Configuration Management. So we expect that will, to a large degree, over the time that it's introduced in FY 2017, replace what we've had with traditional Endpoint Management, which is an on-prem product.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Pat Walravens with JMP Group.", "Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC", "Oh, great. Thank you. Mike, let me first say that, I'm sorry to see you go.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC", "Look, that's just my personal view, but seems to me that there's been enough leadership change at this company already. That being said, and I realize this could change with the new CEO, but I would love to hear your thoughts as to whether it makes sense to split this business even further at this point to be even more focused, or if things are sort of good where they are.", "Michael A. Brown - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Pat, I think you already probably knew my answer to that before you asked the question. We took a long look at the configuration of the business back the summer two years ago, and decided that it made sense to be a security company. And that's when we made the decision about Veritas.", "I think all three of the businesses that \u2013 or all three of the product line areas we have today, so in Enterprise Security, our Website Security product line, plus the Enterprise Security business that we've been refocusing on, and then Consumer Security, are all contributing very significantly, both to the strategy, and we talked about that before we wouldn't have access to all that information about the threat landscape if you took away any one of those key product areas.", "And then, I think that helps us to bring more to what customers are looking for, so they can buy more from fewer vendors, back to the question we were talking about, I think it was with John a few minutes ago. Customers are looking to do more with fewer vendors rather than continue to proliferate this best of breed buy from 100 different vendors and integrate. So I think the breadth gives us a lot of advantage when we're working with customers.", "Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC", "Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn things back to Jonathan Doros for any closing remarks.", "Jonathan Doros - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you for joining us on the call, today.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fiscal Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jonathan Doros, Head of Investor Relations.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings results. We've posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relation events webpage. Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec CEO and Thomas Seifert, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP unless otherwise stated. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks for revenue. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas. However the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered in to prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations. As a result, implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred on the balance sheet will not be representative of standalone Symantec's performance, as it will include an impact from Veritas.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such involve risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular on Form 10-K for the year ended April 1, 2016.", "And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark. Go ahead, Greg.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our performance during the second quarter as our results exceeded our guidance across all metrics. Our cost savings and synergy initiatives are tracking ahead of schedule.", "Within the first 10 weeks of closing Blue Coat, we've made multiple meaningful product improvements and integrations. The feedback on our product roadmap from customers, partners and third-party influences has been overwhelmingly positive. Product integrations are already having a significant impact on our ability to better protect customers and further validates the rationale and power of our combination.", "In my prepared remarks today, I will review some of the key product integrations, highlight the exciting innovation underway within Symantec, discuss some market validation in our enterprise segment and review our Consumer Security business.", "Protecting customers in the cloud generation against a multi-faceted adversary requires an integrated cyber defense platform. Symantec is best positioned in the cloud generation as one of the only vendors to deliver cyber defense solutions across users, information, web and messaging. In support of that effort, I'd like to discuss significant advancements delivered since closing the Blue Coat acquisition on August 1.", "First, I'm particularly proud of the value we are providing our existing customers by integrating artificial intelligence with two of the largest threat databases in the world. This integration has improved our existing products, which are now blocking an additional 500,000 attacks per day across the endpoint and network.", "In a press release last week we provided the market with insight into two attack campaigns that had we not innovated in this way, may have remained hidden. The first of the campaigns is a cyber espionage group called Buckeye, which targeted Hong Kong political organizations leading up to the elections. And second, we discovered a campaign impacting approximately 100 financial institutions worldwide, stealing millions of dollars across various methods, including the SWIFT wire transfer system. These examples of detections were made possible due to the power of integrating endpoint, email and network threat telemetry.", "Moving on, we just completed a major integration of DLP and CASB, which combines the gold standard in data protection with the leading edge CASB solution provided by the Blue Coat acquisition. This integration extends DLP's advanced artificial intelligence-based content detection to cloud applications for shadow IT analysis, granular visibility, encryption and access controls.", "Further innovation on the CASB solution occurred from integrating Symantec's authentication solution. This integration allows any sensitive transaction within cloud apps to call for a second factor authentication, eliminating key loggers and password-based hacks.", "For example, any company that places sensitive data inside of cloud applications can easily apply strong authentication to both users and data. This offering differentiates itself and it requires no on-premise solution. It's a pure cloud security technology enabling our customers to securely adopt cloud technology without delay from internal IT.", "Finally, two of our largest product lines, SEP and ProxySG, have been integrated to ensure advanced malware protection is coordinated between endpoint and network. This integration nearly eliminates the dwell time between detection and containment, thus limiting damaging propagation of zero-day infections.", "Now turning to the market. Part of the industrial logic of combining Symantec and Blue Coat was the immense cross-sell and up-sell opportunity. Let me provide two customer wins during the quarter that demonstrate our teams working together to close highly competitive cross-sell transactions for meaningful outcomes.", "First, a large healthcare company, an existing Symantec DLP customer, had a multi-vendor environment in the network that was in search of a partner that could help them embrace the cloud and simplify their infrastructure. The value proposition of integration between the secure gateway and DLP, along with our vision for an integrated cyber defense resulted in the customer making a multi-million dollar purchase of Symantec's network and cloud solutions.", "In another example, one of the world's largest departments of education, upon realizing the strategic nature of Symantec in its goal of delivering cloud-based learning, made a sizable commitment to the integrated stack, which included Symantec's network and endpoint technologies.", "Shifting back to R&D and the product side of the business, let me now discuss the organic innovation that is thriving across Symantec. Just a few days ago, we launched SEP 14, which is the most complete next-generation endpoint security solution available in the market. From a single lightweight agent, SEP 14 combines traditional and next-generation functionality such as machine learning, zero-day exploit prevention and emulation. For the first time, these next-generation capabilities are available in one scalable enterprise platform.", "I'm also proud to share that based on recent third-party tests, SEP provides the best security in the industry beating competitors and blocking real-world threats and minimizing false positives. Along with SEP 14, last quarter we launched SEP Cloud, which is a fully cloud delivered version of Symantec endpoint protection. We now stand as the only company with endpoint, gateway, email, DLP, CASB and encryption solutions for the cloud.", "Let me switch gears to our Consumer business. Our Norton solutions deliver secure Internet safety for consumers and their families as they transact and communicate across the web, whether on a desktop, laptop or mobile device. Not only do our combined threat intelligence databases improve our Enterprise Security products, but they also significantly improve our Consumer Security solutions by adding Blue Coat's best-of-breed URL data set into the Norton threat prevention engines.", "During the second quarter, the traditional Consumer Security business continued to stabilize with slower declines and improving retention rates both year-over-year and sequentially. We have now fully repositioned the solution to a subscription offering and are focused on acquiring new customers, while improving renewal rates and cross-selling new solutions in order to maximize customer lifetime value.", "Accordingly, although in its early stages, we are very pleased with the growth in mobile and the strong interest from service providers. We are extending the Norton value proposition well beyond the PC platform and look forward to some exciting product launches in the near future. We believe the market opportunity for protecting consumers is larger than what our current consumer products address today. As we move to further penetrate these opportunities, we expect the Consumer Security business to improve its growth trajectory as we move beyond the PC.", "In conclusion, we are very pleased with the second quarter results. The Blue Coat integration is going very well. The fiscal responsibility and cost savings commitment remains on track. Innovation is alive and prospering at Symantec.", "We acknowledge the strong results in Q2, however we believe it is prudent to maintain our fiscal 2017 top line guidance for the year. Given the overachievement in Q2, we are raising our full year fiscal 2017 operating margin and EPS expectations accordingly. In addition, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance from $1.70 to $1.80, despite a headwind of approximately $0.10 from a higher share count.", "Finally, today we announced that Thomas Seifert has decided to step down as CFO at the end of the month. Thomas has been a tremendous asset to Symantec and an integral part of establishing our solid financial foundation. As CFO, Thomas led a number of key strategic initiatives for the company, including the acquisition of Blue Coat, the $7 billion divestiture of Veritas, and the implementation of Symantec's $5.5 billion capital return program and the execution of our $400 million cost efficiency initiative.", "As we prepare for this transition, we're fortunate to have such an incredible finance leader as Nick Noviello, who will succeed Thomas as Symantec's CFO. I've had the pleasure of working with Nick both at Blue Coat where he served as CFO, and throughout the integration process here at Symantec, and I've been continually impressed by his leadership.", "In addition to his technology background and leadership experience, Nick brings an acute understanding and appreciation for Symantec's outstanding people and the critical threat protection we provide to our customers in today's increasingly complex security landscape. I'm confident he'll be an excellent CFO for Symantec during our next phase of growth.", "To ensure a smooth transition, Thomas will work closely with Nick on the transfer of responsibilities, which will occur on December 1. Thomas will remain with us in an advisory role until March 2017. While Thomas' departure is bittersweet, we all congratulate him on his many successes as Symantec's CFO and wish him the very best in his next chapter.", "I will now turn the call to Thomas to provide additional financial details and outlook.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you, Greg, for the kind words. And good afternoon, everyone. It's been an honor to serve as Symantec's CFO during such a pivotal time in the company's history. I joined Symantec in order to lay the groundwork for our strategic and financial transformation. And I'm proud of the incredible progress we have made over the past two and a half years. Symantec is now the leading pure play cyber security company and in a strong financial position, and this is the right time for me to take on my next challenge.", "I'm confident Nick will be a strong CFO for the company and echo Greg's sentiment. I look forward to continuing to work with them over the next month and in an advisory role for the company until March of next year. Before I move to our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the support of our board, our executive team and, of course, my finance team. I look forward to maintaining our strong momentum throughout the transition process.", "Now turning to our results. Today I will provide an overview of our second quarter results, update on our $500 million cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies and conclude with our financial outlook. Additional details are provided in our CFO commentary, which is available on our Investor Relations website.", "Our second quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1.015 billion, $25 million above the high end of our guided range of $960 million to $990 million, driven across both Consumer and Enterprise Security.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 29.2% and 520 basis points above the high end of our guided range of 21% to 24%. The upside was driven by top-line leverage and faster than expected realization of cost savings.", "Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.30 and above our guidance of $0.18 to $0.21. Our fully diluted share count of 644 million was above our expectations of 640 million, due to higher than expected dilution from our convertible debt related to the increase in the share price. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $55 million and included $45 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and separation.", "Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment. Enterprise Security revenue, which includes two months' contribution from Blue Coat following the closing on August 1, was $610 million and increased 24% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance of up 14% to 20%. Enterprise Security operating margin was 12%.", "Within Enterprise Security, both organic revenue performance and revenue from Blue Coat exceeded our expectations. Endpoint security grew in low-single digits and user authentication grew double-digit. Cyber security services had another solid quarter, growing in the high-single digits. Website security continues to grow in low-single digits.", "And for the two months' period, Blue Coat contributed $124 million compared to our estimate of $100 million. We were pleased with the sales execution from the Symantec sales force given the shorter than normal close period for Blue Coat products.", "Now on to the Norton Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, an improvement from our guidance of down 7%, and Consumer operating margin was 55%. Let me now review some additional performance metrics for the business. Our renewal metrics continue to improve as we benefit from the shift to subscription and a focus on acquiring new customers. At the end of the September quarter, we reached the international one year anniversary of the shift to subscription.", "In regards to mobile, we are seeing good momentum, with total active mobile users up 56% year over year. This momentum is encouraging, as it takes us beyond the PC form factor. We also had over 1 million downloads of our 30-day free trial of mobile WiFi privacy app and plan to launch a multi-device version next year. However, WiFi privacy is still not material to our Consumer revenue.", "Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We have $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $7.2 billion in total debt including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We continue to expect to delever our balance sheet over the medium term. Our previous $1 billion ASR completed today on November 3. And lastly, we remain committed to maintaining our regular quarterly dividend.", "Turning to the $550 million cost savings initiative and the Blue Coat integration synergies. As of the end of September on a run-rate basis, we have recognized just over $100 million of cost savings and synergies, mainly across the areas of procurement and organizational effectiveness, while maintaining a strong investment in our products and R&D. For example, the procurement work stream contributed more than $65 million total run-rate by optimizing our supplier network. We are on track for more than $200 million of run rate net cost efficiencies exiting fiscal year 2017 and continue to expect to meet our goal of $550 million of net cost efficiencies and integration synergies by the end of fiscal year 2018.", "Now I will provide our updated financial outlook. We are encouraged by our Q2 top line results. However, as Greg indicated, we believe it's prudent to maintain our full year 2017 revenue guidance at this time. The integration of our offerings is resulting in more cross-selling of permanent licensed product with the subscription products, resulting in increased ratable revenue recognition. As a result, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be up 11% to 13% to $4.040 billion to $4.120 billion.", "From a cost perspective, we are tracking ahead of schedule on our cost efficiency and synergies initiatives. Due to lower expenses in Q2, we now expect our fiscal 2017 operating margin to be 27% to 29%, up from 26% to 28%.", "With respect to fiscal 2017 EPS guidance, we are benefiting from the $0.10 EPS upside from second quarter, however that increase is partially offset by changes in our full year fully diluted share count between previous guidance and our current forecast. Our prior guidance for fully diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2017 was 616 million shares and our current guidance is now 640 million shares.", "The difference in fully diluted shares outstanding is partially due to an additional 9 million shares of dilution from the convertible debt due to the increase in share price to approximately $25 from $21 at the time of previous guidance. You can find tables on the Investor Relations site related to the convertible debt dilution. The remaining difference is primarily related to the timing of share repurchases across the remainder of fiscal 2017. We continue to evaluate the method and timing of future share repurchases.", "Assuming our current forecast of a fully diluted average share count of 640 million, we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.04 to $1.12 to $1.18. For the fiscal third quarter, we expect our non-GAAP revenue to be up 15% to 18% in constant currency to $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion", "We expect Enterprise Security to be up 34% to 37% in constant currency to $675 million to $690 million. We expect Consumer revenue to be down approximately 6% to $395 million to $400 million. And we expect an operating margin of 27% to 28%.", "We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 to $0.29, with a tax rate of 29% and fully diluted average share count of just over 650 million shares. As Greg stated, for fiscal 2018, we continue to expect $1.70 to $1.80 in EPS, despite a headwind of $0.10 from a higher share count. We continue to expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% as we enter fiscal 2018. Thank you.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "All right, operator, please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. Thomas, just want to start off by saying it's been a pleasure working with you. I thought you did a great job navigating the acquisitions and the spinoff and the cost cutting initiatives.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "All right, so first question, I guess Blue Coat has been integrated now. It's essentially complete, and you've got a comprehensive security platform covering network, endpoint and email, which is similar to a few other vendors like Palo Alto and Check Point. I guess, can you give us your high level views on how you'll differentiate from those other platforms?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes, I think that's a good question, Andrew. There is a substantial number of differences. One is that the threat telemetry that is sitting behind the Symantec threat platform is gargantuan. It comes from well over 100 million endpoints that are in production across the consumer threat telemetry as well in the enterprise, in addition to 15,000 Internet egresses coming in from the Blue Coat network points. That gives us telemetry and some of the examples that I mentioned earlier in the call. It gives us telemetry into things that we believe we are unique in our ability to detect cyber problems from that.", "In addition to that, I'd like to point out that for cloud generation, you can get the Symantec threat platform and a pure cloud instantiation, which means if you are a company that is using a bunch of cloud applications that are out there, whether it be Salesforce.com, SuccessFactors, all the things we know, that you can instantiate the cyber defense for the users that are using that, the data that's in it and get that without even purchasing an appliance or running a wire. And that's really differentiated between what you could get from the vendors that you mentioned.", "And so we really also have spent a ton of time in making sure that we keep the platform open. Our customers do rely on best-of-breed products and being able to integrate those into the Symantec integrated cyber defense platform is a huge competitive advantage. And so that's something we're committed to with our ISV partners as well.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay got it. And then digging in a little deeper on the products side, I saw the integration of DLP with your CASB is now complete. Can you just give us any color on the proprietary advantages that that product will have over the competition and why others can't replicate that?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, that's a good question. Our CASB has a piece of it called Content IQ, which goes out into the cloud properties that an organization is using in shadow IT, and using machine learning techniques, can actually detect the data that is inside of the cloud applications that may have compliance problems. We then use the data protection technology from the Symantec side to go after those problems and cure them so that that data can be allowed to still be in the cloud but be protected in a way where you don't have risk of compliance problems or other data loss.", "In addition to that, we have integrated the CASB technology with the product called VIP, which allows us to add a second factor of authentication to the cloud properties. And what that means is if you are logging into Salesforce.com and you're worried about making sure that it's Greg logging into Salesforce.com, I have a second factor application on my phone or a fob that I use and plugged into my computer, and then it adds that factor of authentication to all of those cloud applications without the organization's IT having to do anything.", "This is extremely powerful as a lot of the password and key loggers breaches that happen across these technologies is solved by that problem. So we've integrated those two things. And I'd just like to point out that that and the threat telemetry integration that we've been talking about, we closed the acquisition on August 1, and our engineering teams are working together extremely well. We've got some rapid delivery there and real proof points in the market.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Shaul Eyal.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Congrats in the upside to quarterly results. Let me also extend best wishes to Thomas going forward, was a pleasure working with you.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Symantec Corp.", "Thanks.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So I want to start and ask on the endpoint front, what's the early feedback you are hearing from customers on Symantec Endpoint 14? An in what way is it differentiated from a next-generation provider say like a Cylance, some of the other players out there?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So that's a very good question. So we've been working very hard on SEP 14. It's a real major advancement for us over here at Symantec. We have tested it with over 400 beta customers that are using it already. And we announced a GA for it this week. It contains the advanced machine learning and behavioral analysis technology that you hear about from what the market calls nex-gen endpoint or signature list endpoint technology. So we have definitely delivered all of the defenses that work on zero-day attacks and signature list things, the machine learning behavioral analysis, reputational detection technology.", "So we believe that we have now leapfrogged the current advanced endpoint competition. And one of the major advantages of ours is ours has a very low false positive rate in the space and think of it as converged endpoint that includes all of the stuff that you need from traditional endpoints with the next-generation capabilities. And we really have dramatically reduced the footprint size, bandwidth usage, and we're very optimistic. Feedback on the initial use of SEP 14 is extremely positive. So we think that this will definitely have a major impact in the market.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Got it. And just as a follow up, so also encouraging upside to the Consumer division results. Can you talk to us about some of the trends you're seeing on that front? What's driving the upside? Is it the shift to subscription, the turning on of auto renewals, progress with telcos, moderating PC declines or just all of the above? Or any unique reason behind the positive result?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So that's a very good question. So it is a mix of all of the above. We actually have performed extremely well in our consumer sector. We have finished the transition to a subscription and auto renewal framework in the Norton business. This has definitely helped with the traction. In addition to that, we have a very strong set of results coming in from some of the new offerings.", "In the last 30 days, we brought out our Wi-Fi protection for mobile users. That has seen a substantial uptake and great feedback from that. In addition to that, our mobile platforms, as Thomas mentioned in his remarks, have been growing at strong double-digit period compares on units. We've seen the service provider market really start to produce some fantastic deployments of the mobile side of what we're doing.", "So those are a couple of proof points where we're executing well in the PC space. Again, we won the Editor's Choice for the most effective malware protection on the PC again, and the auto renewals is helping. The move to subscription is helping. So we feel good about maintaining our position in there.", "And then moving to markets that are off the PC, we have some exciting pure mobile endpoint growth and also we have some things that we'll be launching in the future that will continue to move us into addressable markets that are off the PC value proposition. So we feel good about our future prospects on the Consumer side and the value that we're bringing. As many of us are aware, there is plenty of malware on mobile and there is plenty of malware on Apple platforms, and so we feel good about the future of our Consumer business.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah, thanks, guys. Thomas, I'll offer my congrats as well. It was certainly great working with you over the years, and best of luck on your next endeavor. Greg, I think it was actually maybe in Thomas' prepared remarks, talking about a change in the product mix in conjunction with the integration. I'm wondering if you could you expand on that a little bit more? What are you seeing in the pipeline and how might this impact revenue going forward?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes, very good question, Matt. Thanks for asking it. We've brought together two of the broadest portfolios in security software and we're going to package our products in the manner in which our customers want to buy it. If you think about what we would do walking into a large enterprise, we would offer with the combination of products, different bundles and different packagings of our products. When we do that, this could result in less upfront revenue recognition and, therefore, we're being conservative in our guidance.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That's great. And then maybe one more on the Consumer side. I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on some of the consumer telco deals. I think you started in India, Germany, maybe Japan. And any thoughts about rolling that program out to other geos?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, so we've had great results with our mobile defense platforms in some of the markets that you mentioned. India is a particular standout. We also have, I would say, outstanding interest in our capabilities for most of the world's Tier 1 service providers. What we've seen I think this year with all of the wallets and easy to charge on peoples mobile platforms, we've seen malware showing up there in significant quantities. And I think Symantec is very focused on protecting our customers in this area. And service providers are definitely very interested in it. We will be addressing that route to market in a much more aggressive way in the coming quarters. Early results are very promising.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian.", "Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi. Thank you so much. Congratulations on your first quarter, Greg. And, Thomas, thank you for all the help you provided us. We really appreciate it. I had a couple questions for you, Greg. One of the things we've been focused on is the partner ecosystem, given how important it is to the business. So we'd appreciate hearing from you a little bit about how partners are reacting to the integration, and what opportunities you're seeing there to potentially drive revenues to the partners.", "And then second, how are you thinking about protecting IoT in light of all these recent (34:16) denial of service attacks? Do you think consumers are going to start to protect their IoT and where do you see yourself playing into that market?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes, they're two very good questions. Sarah. So let me start off with the partner one, yeah, we are very focused on maintaining our strong relationship with the channel. I think myself and Mike Fey have great reputations as taking care of what is that very large, extended sales force we have around the world at the Tier 2 VAR and also in the excellent Tier 1 value added distributors that we use. Nothing is going to change there. And we had an excellent partner conference earlier this month where we recommitted to the channel. I think we have a good trusted relationship there and right now we're doing the same thing in APAC and also in EMEA this week.", "So we feel good about our relevance to the VARs and resellers out in the world, whether it be in the small/medium-size business, the mid-market, or in the enterprise. And we continue to be a substantial element of the economics in the channel. We are the largest pure play security vendor and the combination between Blue Coat and Symantec really does make this a very meaningful part of the channel economics.", "And I think without very strong middle-market story \u2013 we released a product in the last quarter which was called SEP Cloud. That is extremely powerful for that middle-market, SMB part of the world, and we feel good about that. And we think we continue to deliver market relevance to the part of the market where those VARs and resellers are essential, which we think will drive up interest in continuing to do business with them and more revenue for both them and us.", "Moving on to your next question, which was about the IoT situation. IoT is, as we saw a couple of Fridays ago when some of the DNS and the Internet stopped working and had significant knock on effects. It's a wake-up call for the power of when you bring a bunch of unmanned devices to the Internet and don't protect them properly, that creates a weapon that can be quite difficult.", "We are coming after that from two points. One, we do have some solid technology that will be coming out through our Norton brand to help protect that from the actual consumer electronic devices in the home. And we're also working hard to be able to bring some network protection to this world also and be able to use some of our behavioral analysis technologies to realize some these things are not doing what they're supposed to be doing.", "So this is an area that will be a long battle between the adversaries in the industry as people weaponize IoT and consumer electronics. We believe we are an essential technology in the fight against that, and it will take governments and consumer electronics manufacturers and security vendors to sort it out.", "I'd also like to point out in terms of securing IoT and being able to build secure infrastructure, we are a market leader in the tools that you need to do that, with our Managed PKI, our code signing technologies and what we do in that part of the fabric of the Symantec portfolio. So in terms of relevant vendors to come after this IoT problem, we are definitely one of them, and we think that will lead to tailwinds for us as that becomes more of essential and potentially even policy mandates from governments about it. So good question, big problem, and we're definitely working on it.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of John DiFucci.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you. I have a question, Greg, about the Consumer business. Can you just sort of give a refresh on how you think about this strategically? On one hand, it's a really high margin business, but on the other hand we've seen this, continual revenue declines for some time here. Is this something where you're going to focus on? I know you talked a little bit about trying to turn that business in some way, but if you do that, is it going to have a material effect on profitability if you really start to invest there?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, so it's a really good question, John. And I think this is something that we work on a lot because we have a strategy that we believe can turn it around and return it to growth. And that strategy is really anchored in moving the value proposition that we have from PC malware to a larger super set of PC malware, which is really Internet safety. The consumer is really interested in safety while using the Internet, safety for the family, a piece of which is the malware on the endpoint.", "So we are going after all endpoints, whether it be Apple endpoints, mobile telephone devices, tablets and PCs. And we're also going after other value propositions that a consumer, when they're using the Internet, considers necessary. And we have some announcements coming out on that soon. I won't announce them on this call, but we are definitely working hard on real P times Q, based on real market data that can turn that business around and return it to growth.", "There are elements that are off the PC declines, which are kind of the natural forces happening in the industry. So everybody who wants to mark us down because Consumer's going to melt, we're working really hard to make sure that around so it doesn't melt. And we have very strong brand recognition in Norton. People trust us, and we think we can deliver substantial value to the consumer through that brand for things that are adjacencies to the PC malware decision. So, hang on.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Would this?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "It's going to get better.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, okay.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Our guidance is conservative, John. Our guidance is conservative on the Consumer guide.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. But the kind of investment that that might require, you've already done some, but is this something we should continue to expect, similar profitability in that business going forward at least for the foreseeable future? Or would this kind of, if in order to turn around the top line, could it have a material effect, a negative effect on the margin? Yeah.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, so a couple of examples. We already have released a pretty substantial Wi-Fi protection capability under the Norton brand. We did that while maintaining the margin contribution that we have in the business already. That was a not insignificant R&D investment. One of the things about Symantec is we have many thousands of engineers, so we can move 50 of them around to a problem like that without any issues. So we feel good about our ability to continue to deliver that at the margin, and we are reaffirming our margin commitments in the guidance that we're putting out for FY 2018 with those plans on board, okay. And our EPS range in 2018, that's with the engineering efforts and marketing efforts planned in Consumer.", "John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "The answer is I think we're going to be okay, and being able to do that at the margin we're at.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And our next question is Brent Thill.", "Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, the Enterprise Security did very well during the quarter, I think we all look at that business and see there's a lot of opportunity both on top line and bottom line. Where do you see the nearest opportunity just on the revenue side when you look at the joint Blue Coat/Symantec team? And then on the bottom line can you just talk a little bit about the margin structure at 12%, clearly a lot of the peers are a lot higher. Where do you think you can drive that to over time?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So let me just clarify something I said answering John's question. I think you have the FY 2018 guidance is EPS only on the $1.70 to $1.80 range. And my comments around the FY 2017 margin guide were doing those things with the plans we have in Consumer baked in. Coming back to your question, can you ask it for me again, just to make sure I got it right?", "Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, just as it relates to the Enterprise Security business, the low hanging fruit that you see in front of you just on the top line and then on the bottom line at the 12% op margin, your competitors are considerably higher. Where do you think you can drive that margin to over time?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So the opportunities on the top line, as we talked about on prior calls, we have not really cooked a whole bunch of revenue synergies, cross-sell and up-sell, into our thinking. Where they live is we do believe that in the network area where we're selling the gateway technologies that are highly adjacent to email and to DLP, we have a great opportunity for cross-selling the combined solutions there. Also, the power that you get when you hook up our networks with endpoint results in substantial enhanced cyber defense, and we do think that there are a bunch of cross-sell and up-sell opportunities.", "We mentioned on the prior remarks a couple of examples of DLP customers where we were strongly advantaged with the network technologies and endpoint technologies, that we're strongly advantaged from the network technologies. We feel good about what we can put together in terms of product bundles that the market's going to like, customers are going to like. And in outlying years, I think we'll be able to lead the market with the enterprise solution set for cyber defense.", "Margin-wise, I think at this point in time we are committed to taking out the $550 million of sustainable run rate expenses. We've given you guidance on the FY 2017 margin numbers. And at this point in time, it's too early for us to guide the top line for 2018.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Symantec Corp.", "But I think it's fair to say that all the additional cost take-out is primarily going to benefit the Enterprise business from a profitability perspective. So we are not at $100 million run rate improvement so far. We said we're going to be north of $200 million by the end of the fiscal year. Still there's plenty to be implemented until we get to $550 million, and the delta really primarily towards the Enterprise margin.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Exactly. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you, guys, for taking the question and nice quarter. Two questions I wanted to ask. One about distribution in terms of how far into the integration of Blue Coat sales people are we? And vice-versa, how well are we into the integration of the Symantec sales guys? Or who's proper being able to sell the Blue Coat portfolio? How much further do we have to go on that side of the equation?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So we've made a ton of progress there, Keith, and we've picked the leadership for those organizations across the world in the channel, in the mid-market, in the enterprise. And that is going extremely well. We have had our integrated sales force kick-off. We brought them all to Las Vegas and had a week's worth of getting everything lined up and planned out. And the regional teams are out now executing. We feel really good about where we're at on the integration of our go-to-market teams. Keith, I'd also like to point out that the initial results from Q1, if we were going to have problems, we'd be seeing them. And we feel really good about that integrated sales force and how we're coming out of the blocks on that.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And the second question is more along the lines of how should we track the business on a going-forward basis. You're talking a little bit about mix shift in terms of revenues, more coming through as attrition versus perpetual. At times, we've looked at Symantec on a billings basis, looking at billings growth as an indicator of overall growth. That's hard right now with the acquisition accounting.", "Maybe just looking for some guidance from you guys in terms of, what do you think is the best indicator of the underlying demand trends? Is there some adjusted billings number we should be looking to? Or is it just we have to fall back on revenues and just take into account the subscription versus perpetual adjustments that are going to be going on?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "At this point, Keith, I think we want to stay on the revenue reporting that we have and we give you the cash flow information and the balance sheet, and I think you'll be able to put it back together. We do feel that that's a good question for as we get into Q3 and Q4.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Operator, next question?", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Walter Prichard.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks. Question for Thomas on the Blue Coat contribution, the $124 million that you saw in the quarter. Can you talk about the delta there between the $100 million you were expecting? Was it just simply timing of business that came in? Or was that business indeed better than expected if you look at it on maybe a full quarter basis or whatever makes sense to calibrate?", "Thomas J. Seifert - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, I'm not even sure we want to be this granular. First of all, we are really pleased that our sales team was able to provide that in the short period of time we had to close. I think there for sure is a combination of both elements in that number. But overall I think what we said in the prepared remarks holds true. We are encouraged by the momentum that we see and by the momentum that the sales force brought into our first combined quarter from an execution perspective. But it's one data point and that's why we think it's still prudent to be very conservative in the outlook we provide.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And then, Thomas, just similar to that question on the billings from Blue Coat. Could you help us understand, did the billings exceed the revenue for the $124 million in the quarter or were they less? Or any sort of color you could give us around that would be helpful as well.", "Thomas J. Seifert - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, as you know, we've got a lot of moving parts, and that's why we wanted to stay away from giving that granular business guidance. We have to digest the integration. We still have some noise in our billings numbers from a Veritas separation perspective. From an overall billings performance, I think if you look for a proxy, look at our GAAP revenue and the change in deferred and that gives you an approximation of how billings have performed quarter-over-quarter for the combined company. If you do your math, it's going to be approximately 12%. But for the time being in the short term, we'd like to focus and less the attention on revenue, on margin and EPS.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

(NASDAQ:SYMC) Q3 2017 Earnings Call February  1, 2017  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Analysts", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Ian, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Fiscal Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. .", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jonathan Doros. Sir, you may begin.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings results. We've posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations, Events webpage. Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec's CEO, and Nick Noviello, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks for revenue. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses excludes the impact of Veritas. However, the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations. As a result, implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred on the balance sheet will not be representative of stand-alone Symantec's performance, as it will include an impact from Veritas.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.", "As you may have seen, today we made an announcement about a possible debt offering. Due to SEC rules restricting publicity in offerings of this kind, we cannot provide more information about the offering, and will therefore be unable to comment or answer your questions on this topic.", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark. Go ahead, Greg.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you and good afternoon. In my remarks today I will; one, recap our third quarter results; two, update you on the execution of our strategy; three, give you a progress report on our execution since combining Symantec and Blue Coat; four, discuss our confidence in the long-term outlook for Symantec.", "First, let me give you a quick overview of our execution in the third quarter and the progress we've made during this period. Consistent with our fiscal Q2, we exceeded our third quarter revenue guidance across", "both consumer and enterprise on a constant currency basis, and also beat our operating margin and EPS guidance.", "Furthermore, we are seeing evidence that the underlying fundamentals of the business continue to improve. In just two quarters since combining Symantec and Blue Coat, we are making great progress on our product integration and cost efficiency initiatives.", "From a go-to-market perspective, we are seeing good collaboration in the field and are confident in our fiscal 2017 outlook. Our sales force is performing well and from an integration standpoint we are aligned operationally for a successful start to fiscal 2018. And finally, we expect to close LifeLock acquisition by February 9, and we are pleased with LifeLock's updated outlook filed today. This is an impressive result given the typical distractions that can occur around a transaction and a credit to the strength of their business.", "Now let me discuss how our Enterprise Security strategy and how it's resonating with customers. The response from customers and our global channel to our integrated cyber defense platform gives us confidence in our market position in both cloud and hybrid cloud. We believe, as an industry, we are in the early innings of a dramatic shake-out among winners and losers within the estimated over $80 billion to be spent annually on enterprise security.", "In the near future, we predict there will be less than a handful of strategic security providers, Symantec being one, which will have made the appropriate technology investments to lead in the cloud generation of security. Investment in solutions that help customers migrate to the cloud is core to our long-term plan. We are delivering this innovation, while also integrating our products. Customers are excited about both our product advancements and eliminating integration work traditionally done by expensive internal staff. We believe the work we are doing will result in a multi-year acceleration in market share gains from where we are today, as we invest in this massive transformation to the cloud.", "Conversely, there will be a group of security companies whose products fulfill just an element or feature of a platform, as well as vendors that are not making substantive investments for the cloud generation of security. We do not believe these companies will remain competitive over the long run. I would like to walk you through some examples of our leadership and some progress we've made.", "To begin, I would like to draw your attention to a significant cyber incident that occurred recently in the Middle East. Critical infrastructure at a large chemical company was attacked by highly advanced malware. Shortly after the attack, the affected company announced that Symantec had resolved this difficult problem for them. We don't disclose the exact details of these incidents, but the results speak for themselves. We're very confident in our ability to help our customers defend against and recover from complex state-sponsored cyber-attacks.", "Our threat intelligence is differentiated from our peers, in that we combine a tremendous breadth and volume of consumer and enterprise data from multiple threat vectors, including third parties. Another example, in December, the value of our threat intelligence was demonstrated again with the public disclosure of our assistance to the FBI in tracking and arresting the cyber group called Bayrob, who was responsible up to $35 million in thefts and more than 300,000 compromised computers.", "We are also very pleased by the third party recognition we've recently received, which validates our strategy and informs our value in the marketplace. Some examples. First, on the endpoint, AV-TEST just announced that Symantec Endpoint Protection and Norton Security won the Best Protection Award for the second year in a row for its industry-leading capabilities to stop sophisticated cyberattacks. Symantec is the first company to win this prestigious award in both the business and consumer categories two years in a row.", "Second, at the end of January, we were again placed in Gartner's Leader's Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection for 15 years running. We are appreciative of Gartner's recognition once again, which we believe reflects our investments in artificial intelligence for SEP 14, coupled with our leadership in prevention. We are optimistic about future market gains for our endpoint franchise.", "Third, another strong validation of our relevance and technology leadership in cybersecurity comes from an independent study that was recently published by academia and industry titans, which reviewed the security industry's ability to adequately handle an encrypted Internet. The Blue Coat Proxy received an A rating by the study, whereas all remaining security offerings that were tested received a C or an F for securely handling encrypted traffic. We've provided a link to the report on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I would like to touch on some product innovation highlights from the last quarter, including the progress of our integration of the Blue Coat acquisition. The endpoint has become the battleground for protecting users against advanced threats, as roaming users proliferate and network traffic becomes increasingly encrypted. We recently shipped our next generation endpoint solution, Symantec Endpoint Protection, SEP 14, in November. It's off to a strong start, and we are seeing acceleration of new wins and pipeline build. SEP 14 combines machine learning and exploit protection functionality with our comprehensive stack of endpoint technologies, all within a lightweight agent.", "While many of the upstart competitive endpoint vendors are only solving a single slice of the endpoint security challenge, SEP 14 is the only complete solution in the market covering prevention, detection, and response within a single agent architecture. Furthermore, our solution includes support across multiple devices and multiple OSs. This provides a strong ROI for customers, which we expect will improve over time as we bring additional solutions to market that leveraged this core architecture, thereby fulfilling our customers' desire to make our endpoint platform the cornerstone of their long-term security posture. We are committed to being at the forefront of innovation on the endpoint.", "We are accelerating our rollout of new features with our next SEP release, which will include adaptive policy controls delivered via cloud-based management console and additional functionality targeted at endpoint forensics. And later this year we plan to integrate the SEP agent into our CloudSOC and Web Security Service for end-to-end control of roaming users and inoculation of compromised endpoints. The feedback from customers and industry analysts continues to be overwhelmingly positive on the value SEP provides compared to a multi-agent alternative.", "From a customer perspective, the wins and pipeline have accelerated. I'll give two examples. A large apparel company that was evaluating a point machine learning competitor, backpedaled from their decision after their CISO added SEP 14 into the technical bake-off. The prospect has since converted to becoming a SEP customer. We win the majority of head-to-head bake-offs when customers look past marketing claims and focused on the technical, integration and defense-in-depth merits of our offering.", "Another example of the value of SEP 14 took place at a prominent healthcare company in the Midwest. The company realized they did not need an overly complex and burdensome solution from leading firewall company for memory exploitation, because SEP 14 offered better technology and leveraged their existing infrastructure in a single agent. Displacements like this are underway in many different accounts around the globe.", "These are great examples of the value of our technology. The pipeline is building with many of these types of deals, mainly led by our channel partners.", "We would like to remind everyone that SEP 14 is integrated with our market-leading data protection products for endpoint DLP and ProxySG, which gives additional data loss prevention and network protecting capabilities. As Nick will mention, our endpoint security grew again this quarter.", "Our cloud platform is another area of rapid innovation for us. As we said at the time of the Symantec and Blue Coat acquisition, endpoint integrated with cloud is a very strong value proposition for customers. Most still think of cloud security in discrete feature-sets with unique vendor offerings for CASB, DLP, advanced malware, identity, messaging, and web protection. We have found tremendous value in integrating these stacks to provide an advanced solution for our customers.", "For example, data protection must extend from the endpoint to the cloud supporting both sanctioned and unsanctioned applications. To accomplish this, customers have to integrate their traditional DLP, CASB, and web protection into their cloud strategy, which is overly complicated and expensive involving multiple vendors and consultants. We are the only solution provider delivering seamless integration for our customers across these areas.", "As we progress, the product areas of CASB, DLP and web protection will blur and become a singular requirement from progressive customers. We see validation of this in the market with, for example, the competitive landscape of CASB. Many CASB vendors struggle to deliver sustainable value. They are being forced to extend into product adjacencies to solve even simple challenges posed by the cloud. We believe the technical debt facing these singular vendors is significant, which gives us confidence about the competitive future of our solutions and our position to serve our customers.", "During Q3, we closed numerous new CASB deals across virtually every region and industry. These deals have room for significant expansion through follow-on enterprise-wide transactions that leverage our complete cloud security stack. Just in the last week, we closed a multi-million CASB transaction with one of the largest global telecom providers to secure their move to cloud. All the relevant security vendors competed for this business. We believe this is one of the largest CASB deals ever booked and a sign that we have the most competitive cloud security stack in the industry.", "Our cloud capability is also resonating with both large and mid-market customers as a part of their strategy for hybrid cloud security. As an example, we closed an eight figure new security analytics and CASB win at one of the largest financial services companies. The drivers of the win were our current and future product integrations, specifically ProxySG and Security Analytics, Data Loss Protection and CASB, as well as a future integration of content analysis and endpoint protection.", "In another example, a Fortune 250 healthcare company with a substantial Symantec deployment expanded their footprint after we articulated the strong value proposition of our integrated offering. The first step was a multi-million Blue Coat ProxySG, Content Analysis System, and Malware Analysis win that included replacing an existing competitor. This customer intends to deploy our CASB offering as they continue to adopt cloud solutions.", "And finally, within the mid-market space, another healthcare company with a SEP deployment committed to our integrated strategy with the purchase of the analytics and proxy solution. These examples, customers are moving to the cloud and leveraging a hybrid approach. More importantly, each is an example of customer who is able to achieve stronger cyber protection by investing in our integrated cyber defense platform, while driving more value from their security spending.", "In summary, the power of our platform is driven by integration of our core franchise across users, information, web and messaging, combined with a commitment to openness that provides customers with a trusted cybersecurity partner for their long-term success. The delivery of and reception by industry of our AI solutions in SEP 14 is a validation that we continue to be the leader in endpoint security. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of our Endpoint Security innovation and financial results.", "Now turning to Consumer Security. To recap from the LifeLock acquisition announcement, I would like to cover why we are so passionate about combining LifeLock with our Norton consumer business and extending our brand from primarily PC malware protection to a much larger value proposition that we have branded digital safety for consumers. Consumers pay between two times and three times more for identity protection than they pay for endpoint malware protection. With the acquisition of LifeLock, the value proposition of our consumer solution now extends to include identity protection and recovery services, offering the broadest and most comprehensive platform for consumer digital safety.", "The combined offering will protect consumers' digital presence, alert them to suspicious activity, and protect them against malware. Our combined service will also help consumers recover when their endpoint or identity becomes compromised. We intend to cross-sell LifeLock and Norton offerings into their respective customer bases, which we expect will increase ASPs and retention rates in both cohorts over time.", "The cross-sell opportunity reduces renewal risk at the time of PC refresh. More broadly, we believe consumers are paying in aggregate more now than ever to protect their families' digital presence, and we estimate the combined addressable market for digital safety is now over $10 billion and growing in the high single digits and substantially larger than the subset of PC malware. Since the LifeLock announcement, we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback on our vision for a comprehensive consumer digital safety platform from our customers, partners, and industry participants.", "As I stated earlier, we expect to close the LifeLock acquisition by February 9 and we're expected to begin integrating LifeLock into our Consumer Security business. As you can see from LifeLock's preliminary results filed today, the business momentum is strong across revenue and adjusted EBITDA.", "Now turning your attention to another pillar in our digital safety strategy. This is around protecting the consumers' home, family, and all IoT devices within their digital life. We've seen large scale data breaches exposing hundreds of millions of consumer identities, multi-OS ransomware victimizing the consumer, and now the home IoT network becoming both a target and a cyber weapon.", "At the Consumer Electronics Show in early January, we announced Norton Core. This solution is uniquely designed to protect and manage home networks from hackers that are now compromising connected devices to access personal and financial information, as well as to use such devices as weaponizing consumer electronics in larger scale attacks.", "The feedback coming out of our launch at CES from the industry and partners was fantastic. Some of the accolades we have received so far for our Norton Core launch include the Wall Street Journal's Best of CES 2017, CNET's All the Cool Gadgets at CES 2017, ZDNet's Best Smart Home, IoT Products of CES 2017, and Verge quoted one of the more interesting ideas to come out of this year's CES.", "Key features of this solution include, advanced scanning of data traffic across the home network with the ability to scan connected devices for vulnerabilities and if threat is discovered, to quarantine the device to a segregated network until remediation can be conducted. Next-generation parental controls at both the network and endpoint to set limits for application screen time and quotas, filtering of inappropriate content with the ability to receive notification alerts, and even the ability to pause the entire home network for dinner. The product also delivers an easy-to-use mobile app forming a cyber defense console for consumers.", "The Norton Core security and parental control solution is currently uniquely hardened to our platform, but it can be tightly integrated as part of other networking platforms, such as cable modems. We are in discussions with several service providers and device manufacturers regarding the value of Norton Core. Norton Core is yet another example of the organic innovation that is flourishing at the new Symantec.", "In summary, we are confident about the long-term outlook for Symantec. Since August, we have fully integrated our threat databases and now blocking more threats than either Symantec or Blue Coat ever did on their own; brought to market an integrated cyber defense platform for the enterprise that includes major integrations across the respective solutions; accelerated the transformation of our consumer business with organic innovation and with the announced acquisition of LifeLock; and delivered substantial innovation across our portfolio.", "And as Nick will cover, we have also tracked ahead of schedule on our cost and synergy initiatives. We are well on our way towards simplification of our business processes to drive internal operating efficiencies and make our company easier to do business with. We've exceeded our revenue, margin and EPS guidance for the last two quarters, and reinforced our leadership in cyber defense innovation.", "We believe our Enterprise and Consumer Security business are both positioned for long-term sustainable organic growth with strong profitability. Cybersecurity is at the top of the agenda for governments, businesses, and consumers. And we now intend to take the significant assets we have to build and become the leading cybersecurity company in the world.", "Now let me turn the call over to Nick.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, give you an update on our progress against our $550 million in cost efficiencies and Blue Coat integration synergies, outline our near-term capital allocation plans related to share repurchases, review our financial outlook for Symantec related to fiscal year 2017 and our fourth quarter fiscal year 2017, and discuss LifeLock and its potential implications to our fourth quarter, incorporating both our expectations for the financial results from the LifeLock business during our period of ownership in Q4, as well as the impact of the transaction financing, neither of which is built into the fiscal year 2017 and Q4 guidance we issued today, given the transaction has not yet closed.", "In addition to our call today, we have made additional details on our Q3 results and the impact of foreign currency to our guidance available in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our IR website.", "Our third quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1.088 billion, up 19% on a constant currency basis, which was above our guided range of up 15% to 18%. Since we provided guidance in November, foreign currency had a negative $18 million impact to our non-GAAP revenue of $1.088 billion. We disclosed this impact in our Q3 FY 2017 foreign currency update posted on our IR website on January 12.", "Excluding the impacts of foreign currency, non-GAAP revenue exceeded the high end of our prior guidance by $16 million. Operationally, we experienced improved revenue performance and beat our prior revenue guidance in both our Consumer and Enterprise Security segments. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 30%, 2 points above the high end of our guided range of 27% to 28%, despite the headwind from foreign currency.", "Foreign currency negatively impacted non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points compared to our guidance. Operationally, our strong non-GAAP operating margin was driven by top-line revenue performance and continued execution against our cost savings initiatives and synergies.", "Fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.32, above our guidance of $0.27 to $0.29, and reflected our strong operational performance, despite $0.01 of headwind from foreign currency. Fully diluted shares outstanding increased by 10 million from Q2, primarily due to the impact from our convertible notes, driven by increased share price. Please see the dilution tables posted to our IR website, where you can see the impact to diluted share count from the convertible notes at various stock prices. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $144 million and included $30 million in cash outflows related to restructuring and transition.", "Let me now provide further detail on our performance by segment. Our Enterprise Security segment non-GAAP revenue increased 40% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our prior guidance by 3 points. Enterprise Security non-GAAP operating margin was 17%, up 5 points from 12% last quarter.", "Within Enterprise Security, our endpoint security products grew again in the low single digits buoyed by our release of SEP 14 and its next generation endpoint capabilities. Cybersecurity services had another solid quarter, growing in the mid-single digits, as customers rely on our security intelligence and talent.", "Blue Coat's products contributed $207 million of non-GAAP revenue in the quarter, and $331 million year-to-date. Non-GAAP revenue from Blue Coat products on a year-to-date basis is performing in-line with our expectations. As we indicated, Blue Coat products are now part of a broad and integrated cyber defense offering for the enterprise. As we are managing the Enterprise Security portfolio as a combined offering, we will not provide going forward guidance specific to Blue Coat revenue. Overall, we are very pleased with our strong combined enterprise segment revenues and operating margin in Q3, which exceeded our expectations.", "Now, onto our Consumer Security segment. Consumer Security non-GAAP revenue was down just under 5%, an improvement from last quarter and better than our guidance of down 6%. Consumer non-GAAP operating margin was 54%, in-line with our expectations.", "Within Consumer Security, we continue to see improvement in our renewal metrics, as we benefit from the shift to subscription and a focus on delivering a premium digital safety platform to consumers. Our mobile user count grew approximately 50%. We expect to see an increasing tailwind to revenue growth from our mobile telco customers beginning in fiscal 2018. Though they are substantial from a user count, currently these customers are not a material contributor to in-quarter revenue. As Greg mentioned, service providers are strategically important to Symantec, as they strengthen our value proposition to customers seeking unified protection across multiple endpoints, including PC, Mac, iOS and Android, as well as consumer IoT in home.", "Now, turning to our cost savings initiatives and Blue Coat integration synergies. Our total cost savings initiatives are comprised of $400 million in net cost efficiencies on the Symantec business and $150 million in Blue Coat cost synergies. We have achieved savings already across the areas of procurement and organizational effectiveness. We are also beginning to realize savings in IT and real-estate. We have a strict process and discipline in place around this program, and remain on track to achieve over $200 million in net cost savings and efficiencies exiting fiscal 2017, which is better than our original expectation.", "Finally, we continue to expect that we will meet our cost efficiency and integration synergy goals by the end of fiscal 2018. Please note that our current outlook excludes synergies we expect from LifeLock.", "Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. As of December 30, we had $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $7.3 billion in total debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. When we announced the LifeLock transaction in November, we also indicated that our board of directors had increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.3 billion, with up to $500 million planned to be repurchased by the end of fiscal 2017. We are on track to execute this $500 million of repurchases.", "To close the LifeLock acquisition, we expect to raise up to $1.1 billion of debt. Consistent with our approach on the Blue Coat acquisition, we expect the LifeLock acquisition to help us transform our consumer business, while also generating substantial revenue, operating income, and cash flow for the company. Lastly, we remain committed to maintaining our regular quarterly dividend.", "Now I will provide our updated financial outlook. Let me start with the full year, then back into our fiscal fourth quarter. We are reflecting the headwind from foreign currency in this guidance; the specifics of which are noted in the CFO letter posted to our IR website.", "For fiscal 2017 ending in March, we are narrowing our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP revenue outlook to the high end of our previous guidance range, currency adjusted from November. At the midpoint, we are increasing our fiscal 2017 constant currency non-GAAP revenue growth guidance to 12.5% year-over-year from 12% year-over-year. We are increasing our non-GAAP operating margin expectation to approximately 29%, the high end of our previous guidance range of 27% to 29%. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.17 to $1.19 from $1.12 to $1.18, which represents $0.03 at the midpoint despite headwinds from currency and share count. Underlying this, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29% and fully diluted average share count of approximately 644 million shares.", "Now backing into the fiscal fourth quarter, we are increasing the low-end of our fourth quarter non-GAAP revenue guidance, resulting in a range of 24% to 26% growth in constant currency, up from our previous implied guidance of 21% to 28% growth in constant currency. This translates to an outlook on reported revenue of $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion, which incorporates an approximately $30 million headwind from currency from the time we provided guidance on our second quarter call.", "We expect Enterprise Security to be up 48% to 51% in constant currency, which translates to $686 million to $702 million in reported revenue. We expect Consumer revenue to be down 4% to down 3% in constant currency, which translate to $384 million to $388 million in reported revenue. We expect an operating margin of 27% to 29%, which is impacted by 80 basis points headwind from currency. And we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 to $0.29, which is impacted by a headwind of $0.02 from currency. We expect fully diluted average share count of approximately 658 million shares.", "This guidance includes additional dilution from the convertible notes due to our increased share price, as well as our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to execute during the quarter. At the time of this call, we have not yet started the share repurchase program. Given that we have not closed the acquisition of LifeLock, our guidance provided today does not include any contribution from LifeLock.", "With respect to LifeLock and for your modeling purposes, we expect a fairly linear fourth quarter contribution to revenue from LifeLock, given their subscription model. For example, assuming the February 9 close, and based on LifeLock's latest forecast, we would expect a contribution of just under $100 million of revenue and around $9 million of non-GAAP EBIT. This will be offset by incremental interest expense from the debt used to fund the transaction and, to a lesser extent, incremental shares.", "Together, we would expect a net impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 of dilution for the fourth quarter. This potential dilution is not factored into our guidance today, as we haven't closed the transaction. When we report our full year and Q4 earnings in May, you can expect we will reconcile and lay out all of the financial impacts from LifeLock.", "Finally, turning to our fiscal 2018 outlook. Again, in May, you can expect us to lay out our complete financial guidance for the fiscal year 2018. Today, I am only going to update you on the EPS guidance we have given to date.", "We feel good about our operational outlook for FY 2018, from top-line to non-GAAP operating margins, where we expect a material increase in each measure from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. We also look forward to a close of LifeLock leading to the acceleration of our consumer digital safety strategy.", "As you know, since we last provided an outlook on fiscal year 2018 in November, currency has moved materially and remains volatile. This has the potential to negatively impact our fiscal year 2018 revenue and EPS expectations, as it has impacted our third quarter results and is expected to impact our fourth quarter. In addition, our estimate for fully diluted share count will continue to be impacted by changes in the dilution from our convertible notes due to fluctuations in our share price.", "Overall, we continue to expect a result within the $1.70 to $1.80 range in non-GAAP EPS for fiscal year 2018. Expect that when we speak to you in May, we will give you full details of our operational plan for fiscal 2018, our expectation for the Consumer Security business incorporating LifeLock, the impact of LifeLock financing, the impact from currency, and updated share count assumptions.", "Before we turn the call over to Q&A, we would like to highlight a few upcoming events. During the quarter, we will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference, RSA Security Conference, JMP Technology Conference, Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit, Morgan Stanley Technology Conference, Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference, and the Susquehanna Technology Conference. I am also pleased to announce that our Financial Analyst Day will be held on June 8 in San Francisco. A save the date for the event will be sent out shortly.", "Now let me turn the call over to Greg for closing comments.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you, Nick. In summary, the new Symantec is positioned to be the leading cybersecurity provider to protect customers for the cloud generation. With the upcoming acquisition of LifeLock, we are delivering the most comprehensive digital safety platform for consumers at a time when the need for an end-to-end offering has never been more acute for families.", "From a financial perspective, we are on track to gain share and achieve industry leading profitability at scale, which will drive sustainable free cash flow growth. Finally, we are efficiently deploying capital to maximize long-term shareholder value.", "Operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question is from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, I want to start with you. Feedback from the channel on SEP 14 has been positive, and you seem to echo that in some of your prepared remarks, I think at low single digit growth. Can you give a little bit more color on really the value that customers are seeing in SEP versus point products? And maybe if growing pipelines could translate to further acceleration of your endpoint offering.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, so I think there's a couple points that are definitely massive progress for us. First of all, those two references on third party validation around SEP 14 are meaningful. And AV-TEST test is the sort of benchmark of things to get through an endpoint, and winning that two years in a row for detection prevention is definitely a huge accolade for the business.", "In addition to that, in SEP 14, the primary technology add there was we added a bunch of the AI machine learning technology to be able to do what some people call signature-less detection, a behavioral analysis, which some of the new entrants into the market on endpoint protection have sort of hung their business on. We are now the leader in effectiveness for artificial intelligence detection methods, and that's coming through very well in the test on SEP 14, which is why you're hearing good things about it in the channel. So we've had a number of situations where we've joined bake-offs in this area and clearly won them and turned those around. I mentioned one in my remarks.", "Our pipeline is going great, and this has two effects for us. One, we get a lot of new customers as people go and try this out, and we also make sure that we retain a bunch of existing customers, because our footprint in the endpoint in the enterprise is market leading. So all in all, that's going really well. And I think then if you look to the next horizon on endpoint, our endpoint has data protection integration; others don't. That is a massive value proposition to people trying to tackle data loss and other kinds of information protection needs they're having in cloud generation. And now, with the integration of our networking technologies coming in from Blue Coat, we have the endpoint working with the gateways on some very innovative things to really help stop some of the more modern attacks and some of the emerging attacks that we're seeing.", "So we feel very, very good about our ability to compete with SEP 14, and we have also now turned our guns to the incident response elements of an agent and we think that we will soon be able to lay claim to an agent that can do the best prevention in the world, the best detection in the world, and the best recovery. And we think the combination of those three things is market leading. Also the Gartner Magic Quadrant came out, and we are now the only North American vendor left in the Leader Quadrant, and we extended ourselves very well this year in the Leader Quadrant, and some of our traditional competitors are no longer in it. So that is a testament to our effectiveness with the AI technologies we brought to bear on that.", "So we feel pretty good about that. We also feel good about our ability to step in some market share as other folks go out of the quadrant. And all in all, better retention, more market share, we feel good about endpoint. Is that helpful?", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's great. Thanks, Greg. And then maybe one more operational question. You talked about the sales force performing well and is aligned for 2018. I'm curious, though, could you provide a little bit more color on some of the changes that will go into effect in 2018 with your integrated sales force?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah. I think that a really good question. When we embarked on the journey of putting Blue Coat and Symantec together, this was one of the things that myself and Mike Fey really lend a lot of time to making sure the sales force still work. So we're now closing the second quarter on beating our guidance, and one of the main things in any sales force is predictability. I think that that's something that we're feeling very good about and that we have taken two large sales forces and we're predictable and it still works. So like I say sort of \u2013 that's usually things take a pause at the beginning of two large integrations like that. We have not seen that happen, and so we feel really good about the current state of play. As you can see from Nick's comments on our fourth quarter, we're feeling good about right now.", "So what happens in 2018 is we are going into a situation where we have a much expanded sales force. Right now we are incenting the Symantec people and the Blue Coat people to work together. In 2018, we have a much wider approach. We've been doing a lot of training to bring the Blue Coat teams up to speed on the Symantec products, and the Symantec products up to speed on the Blue Coat systems. We are optimistic that after that is deployed, that we will see a massive capacity gain in the field, and we have also been doing a lot of work on our channel. And when we get to our Analyst Day that we announced before, we will give you some insights into the simplification of what we're doing in the channels, which we expect to also drive some substantial efficiency gains both for our channel and for us, which should help us drive better results in 2018.", "So we do have some heavy integration work coming down the pipe in the sales force. We are very experienced at these matters and we've got a lot of training and planning around it. And we feel good about our ability to execute, and we feel very good about the capacity increases we will bring to bear on the market as we get further into 2018.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Greg, I'd like to ask about differentiation in two product areas. First you mentioned CASB quite a bit. It is a competitive field so a differentiation there. And also one of the things that Blue Coat brought to the table was cloud-based delivery system, especially around the proxy. So how important is that and how is your differentiation working there?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "It takes a while and thanks for asking a very important question. So the CASB market is a very important one as we kind of move into the cloud generation. And what it does? It allows you to get your defenses back on applications that are running in a cloud property, perhaps somewhere ServiceNow, Salesforce.com, and also allows you to gain control over a set of infrastructure that's not really under the remit of your CIO. It's an essential element the content of CASB as we migrate to cloud, especially in the enterprise context.", "So we have, I think, really differentiated ourselves. I think the Forrester Research on the current state of CASB really puts us in a highly differentiated space, because we integrated some extremely important pieces. We've taken a very powerful data protection technology from Symantec and integrated it with the CASB solution, and now we have a way better story for what do you do when you find compliance problems in cloud, how do you get it back under control, which is with combination of CASB and data protection come together, very powerful.", "In addition to that, we've integrated the proxy footprint of the large Blue Coat installed base to be integrated with the CASB, whether it be our cloud-based proxy delivery, our virtual appliances, or our physical appliances. They are all now integrated completely with a full stack of proxies, CASB, and data protection. And we will soon be releasing a multifactor authentication add from Symantec VIP, so we would take care of not just the policy management of these things and data protection, but also the authentication in a multi-application environment. The combination of those things is when a customer currently integrates themselves with their own teams, from three, sometimes four vendors stitching that together. And we've come to market and say, you don't have to do that anymore. You can buy that from us, integrated, warranted, supported, delivered globally, and delivered under one SLA.", "So we believe that this differentiation is important. And since we last spoke, we have even delivered a CASB deal in the multiple millions size at a single customer protecting a single one set of applications, which really I think is a testament to the value of this market. We feel very good about our ability to help our enterprise customers get into the cloud generation and maintain their defense in-depth, while they do that. This topic is paramount in my discussion. Is that helpful, Michael?", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "It is. If I could get one quick follow-up. A lot of that is additional. There's a lot of incremental to Symantec from what is coming with Blue Coat. How are you getting the sales force to take that incremental Blue Coat capability and re-enter into discussions with the Symantec existing customers?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So I think Symantec and Blue Coat in product management in the field already had a shared vision here. Like the Blue Coat network technology and the Symantec data protection technology been integrated in the market for a long time, and do well together inside customer accounts. Then we came along and brought CASB to it for the stuff that's outside the firewall and the cloud, and that was a natural fit. And then most people were trying to figure out how to do single sign on a multifactor authentication across 50 cloud apps. We had that solution. So taking these pieces and putting them together in our field was extremely easy to do. This was something where people were hoping we were going to do that, thought we were going to do that, and when we reaffirmed that in our product roadmaps, they were very excited at the customer cold base (47:39).", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks. Congrats on the great quarter and the guidance for Q4, especially in light of the currency fluctuations. So I just want to ask a couple questions on the Consumer segment. So first your Consumer revenue growth on a constant currency basis came in better than guidance, and Q4 was also better than expected. I guess, can you just provide more detail on the trends you're seeing broadly in Consumer?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah. So I think in Consumer, there's a couple things that are really noteworthy. We came to market with the announcement of Norton Core at the CES show in Las Vegas, and we had some comments in our prepared remarks on that. I encourage everyone to go and take a look at those. That launch was extremely well received both at the show and even in our telecom service provider customer base extremely powerful interest in bringing that to market, especially what's been going on in IoT in the home and protecting the family and protecting our customers across multiple channels, whether it be PC, Mac, Android or iOS. And so we have a very strong story there.", "We've also launched our Wi-Fi protection for when you're a consumer and you're roaming around, protect you on all the various Wi-Fi infrastructure that you attach to, which is a dangerous place for malware. And when we put it all together and bringing LifeLock to the story, we have now got a digital safety proposition for consumers, their family, and the total end-to-end cyber defense and identity protection problems that they have. This includes things like next-gen parental controls, where it's not about just blocking inappropriate content. It's about face time, screen time, time of day, and even turning off the applications so that everyone comes to dinner and puts down their cellphone.", "This is really center of mind for consumers. It's been- we have been testing this with our focus groups. We do a lot of focus group testing, and we are very bullish about our ability to increase our consumer revenues from this value proposition. And also as people refresh their PC footprint to be able to not have to work too hard to keep them across that refresh through this value proposition, which is extremely powerful in really bringing our malware protection revenues back to growth. So we think that we \u2013 as we announced at the LifeLock acquisition, that we can do that in an accelerated fashion and we are bullish about the future of our consumer business. We're also encouraged by the results that LifeLock announced today. That was a strong result considering an acquisition at the same time.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. Got it. And then just as a follow-up on your comments on Norton Core. What are your go-to-market strategies for that product? Since most consumers typically buy their home router from a store like Best Buy or they rent it through a cable MSO.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So we've \u2013 a lot of these consumer electronics stores carry Norton already, and we've had extremely good feedback globally from those channels, whether it be in Japan or Germany or the U.K. or here in the U.S. So we're very excited about the consumer channels that we use and the interest in Norton Core from them. And then in addition to that, as I mentioned, we have a strong go-to-market partnership inside global telecom for our Norton products, and that is a natural fit to where we put in not only hardware solutions, but also we combine our technology with existing hardware solutions that are already being deployed by some of these broadband providers.", "So we feel good about really extending our brand. We have real tech here, and we've got a very strong presence from the networking side of Blue Coat in these telecom providers already, and we feel good about being able to really go after that sort of consumer broadband user in the home. Two routes, people that will pick up a powerful piece of technology and bring it home, and also getting it through the service provider themselves.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Excellent. Nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the questions. Greg, I was hoping to dig into LifeLock a little bit more, now that we're little bit closer to the close. You gave us some bones in terms of sort of understanding the upsell framework with core Norton. You talked about sort of the higher value of an identity protection consumer. I was wondering if you could maybe put a little bit of meat on those bones in terms of what we're thinking about in terms of how big is the opportunity within the current Norton base? Is there a lot of overlap? If you can give some kind of dimensions around that potential upsell opportunity, that would be helpful.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "That's definitely a really good question, Keith. Thanks for asking it. So we did a lot of work prior to signing the merger with LifeLock around the analysis of our cohort in North America that are solid Norton customers, very strong brand recognition, been with us a long time. What we liked about that was a lot of the people that really get value from LifeLock are people that are further on in their career and they have lot of assets. They've got home loans, car insurance, multiple credit cards, and that cohort is a very nice mix between what we have in the Norton renewal base and the overlap with LifeLock is in the teens as a percentage.", "So we feel really good about, as we renew those, that cohort being able to bring the identity protection and the digital safety value proposition to them. This is something we tested prior to the deal, and we liked the results from the test. We continue to test and continue to do some surveys and whatnot. I mean, we continue to feel better about those results. Is that helpful?", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you. And maybe one for Nick as well. Just to confirm, when we're thinking about the FY 2018 guidance, it still doesn't include LifeLock in that, number one. And number two, when we're thinking about the currency impacts, can you help us quantify what potential impact the currency had on that $1.75 to $1.80?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah. So hey, Keith. So a couple of things, as we look at the overall. First let me talk about FY 2018. So, remember, when we talked last quarter, we talked about absorbing about $0.10 in FY 2018 around share count. In December, what we did was we said, okay, we're looking at LifeLock, we're looking at our acquisition models with LifeLock, and we're incorporating that in the $1.70 to $1.80. Okay. That incorporates the business, but also the debt around the business. Now we're talking about also we've got additional shares and FX volatility that we have to build in. So when we reiterate the range, they're building in all of those topics.", "So the one thing probably on the script that let me make sure is clear. So what we're saying about LifeLock for the script is, it's not built into our Q4 and FY 2017 guidance, because it's not closed yet. We gave you the view of \u2013 assuming the February 9 ratable revenue recognition, there's not a lot of \u2013 because there's a lot of monthly maintenance, et cetera, we'll be able to get through that valuation in terms of what the haircuts are, et cetera. So that was the \u2013 let's keep in mind, there could be $0.01 of dilution around LifeLock for the quarter FY 2017 and for the year FY 2017. But the $1.70 to $1.80 incorporated our acquisition model.", "Now when we come back in May, we're going to come back and talk about operations of the business, the Symantec/Blue Coat combination business, which we feel very good about. We're going to talk about LifeLock, now that we own it and we understand all the pieces. We're going to talk about the debt on LifeLock and what it's going to cost us, because that we will, obviously, have it done. We'll talk about share count and our perspectives and estimates on share count, because we have to think about the implications of the convertibles, which is on the IR website, but I think it's important in terms of how share count can be volatile, and we'll talk about FX.", "So we've got a bunch of topics we're going to talk about at that point in time, but we wanted to give you a perspective on the $1.70 to $1.80 today. And then your point on FX, let me just make sure I answer that point for the fourth quarter. There's about $30 million of headwind of foreign exchange in revenue in the fourth quarter. So \u2013 and then for the year FY 2017, it's in the mid-40s of headwind to revenue. So I think when we look at our overall guidance for the year FY 2017 and when we look at that revenue, where if you look at the midpoint versus before this call, we have increased it, the margins we have increased, we took the entire EPS range up, we feel pretty good about where we're at.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Greg, a few weeks back a major network breach was discovered in Saudi Arabia, and I believe Symantec played an important role in discovering and flagging it. Can you talk to us about the breach scope, as well as what products or services were deployed by Symantec in this specification? And maybe in that context, can you just also talk to us in general terms, of course, about Symantec's presence in the federal vertical? Thanks.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So, Shaul, it's a good question. So just as a matter of policy as a cyber defense vendor, we never give product details in any account, because that's not a good thing for the adversaries to sometimes know that. So as proud as we are about some of our recent things that we did, it's difficult for us to talk about it. But I wanted to say a few things. If you go and take a look at some press releases, we noticed from our threat telemetry, which is one of the biggest competitive advantages our company has against others, we had seen the instances \u2013 the instance of some very powerful nation state malware coming back slightly morphed late last year. And we reported on that and we told everybody to kind of button up and be careful, because this stuff is not good for you.", "And then there was a report came out a couple of weeks ago that it was back and it had shut down substantial infrastructure in Saudi, and that's something that was reported by the media. And then following that, later in the week, one of those companies tweeted and took an interview with some media thanking Symantec for fixing it for them, just a few days later. What went down between that happening and that tweet coming out was something we're very proud of. We never asked the customer to do it. It was just them thanking us, and we helped them put that back together. So that is a massive capability that we have in terms of being able to detect, then also being able to cure these kind of problems. And so I think that's something that if you take a look at the cyber investments that those organizations have, they are massive and they have a lot of heavy stuff in there to protect them from cyber issues like this.", "And I just would like the audience to know that we are a prime ally in the fight against nation state malware and very capable there. Then in the federal government, similarly to the comment about commercial accounts, we don't like to talk about the kind of products, where, what and when. But we have always had on both the Blue Coat and Symantec side a very strong relationship with all the five eye (01:01:03) governments because we are a very important laboratory in the defense against malware in general, and we have substantial installations all over the world in governments and defense organizations.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thank you so much.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you, Shaul. Good question.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you for joining us today. That's it for \u2013 time for our question and answers. If any follow-ups, please e-mail or call Investor Relations. Thank you.", "Gregory S.

My name is Ian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. Mr. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings results. We've posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations Events webpage. Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec's CEO; and Nick Noviello, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks for revenue. During the call we may speak to growth adjusted for acquisitions metric, which includes prior period non-GAAP revenue from acquisitions adjusted for Symantec's accounting policies including quarterization. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas, however the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation.

We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses those non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and annualizing future periods.

We would like to remind everyone that we'll be hosting a Financial Analyst Day on June 8. Further details are available on our Investor Relations website.", "And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark. Go ahead Greg.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you for joining us. Fiscal 2017 was a transformative year at Symantec with substantial improvement across the entire company. Fiscal 2018 marks the second half of our execution plan to fundamentally transform Symantec's enterprise and consumer businesses addressing both revenue growth and profitability. Today, we announced our Q4 fiscal year 2017 results. And we're also raising our fiscal 2018 EPS outlook to $1.75 to $1.85. I will recap our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results, update you on our progress within Enterprise Security and Consumer Security segments, discuss our transformation and cost savings commitments, and our CFO, Nick Noviello, will provide more details on our financial results and fiscal 2018 outlook.", "Beginning with Q4, our results demonstrate strong and consistent execution relative to our expectations. During the quarter, we saw further evidence that our investments and commitments to innovation are distinguishing us as the leader in cyber security for the cloud generation. Let me highlight a few key areas from the quarter. Our overall Q4 business activity was strong and consistent with our expectations. And within Enterprise Security, we saw a faster than expected increase in mix towards cloud subscription and virtual appliances. We believe this product mix shift is a positive for our business both financially and strategically, is a proof that our customers are designing Symantec into their future cloud security architectures.", "Enterprise Security profitability has improved dramatically with Q4 fiscal year 2017 operating margins up 17 points year over year. Consumer Security revenue growth performed better than our guidance, and LifeLock came in above our revenue expectations as well. Overall, we continued to perform ahead of plan on our cost efficiencies and synergies. Total company margins were at the high end of our guidance. And as a result, we delivered EPS at the high end of our guidance, excluding LifeLock.", "Now turning to our Enterprise business, we are combining best of breed product innovation with unmatched scale. This is leading to significant competitive advantage and differentiates us in the market as the leading cyber security provider for enterprises. During the fourth quarter, business activity was strong. We are pleased to report Enterprise Security grew 2% organically in the quarter. The business activity of our Blue Coat products were in line with our expectations at above-market growth. And we hit a big milestone in Q4, as we have achieved feature parity between our network products delivered through an appliance and its corollary in the cloud. We now have the leading software elements across relevant deployment methods: appliances, virtual appliances, and pure cloud. During the quarter, we doubled the number of cloud proxy competitive wins versus our next largest cloud competitor. And we are pleased that we saw accelerating demand for cloud and subscription solutions. Selling more cloud solutions is a positive indicator for future success. This has an effect on end period revenue with the benefit of increased deferred revenue. The Blue Coat subscription offerings are now approaching $100 million revenue run rate, growing 67% year on year in the fourth quarter with business activity more than doubling on an annualized basis.", "Now on to Consumer Security results for Q4 fiscal year 2017; Consumer Security exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance on an organic basis, and LifeLock performed above revenue expectations with strong underlying growth metrics. LifeLock renewal rates increased year over year and cumulative ending members were up 8% year over year. This is an impressive result amidst the significant acquisition and integration activity.", "Moving to the full year fiscal 2017, the results show improving revenue performance and delivered ahead of plan on operating efficiency, while we are, at the same time, integrating our transformative acquisitions. Nick will cover the full year fiscal year 2017 details in his remarks.", "Now let me turn to the strategic progress we are making in Enterprise Security. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is clearly resonating with customers. We believe our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform provides the security reference architecture for the future of IT environments whether on premise, software defined or in a pure cloud delivery model. The strength of our platform begins with a strong commitment to leading cyber defense intelligence. As we have commented on previously, the integration of Blue Coat and Symantec threat intelligence has created a differentiated lens into the threat landscape. An example of our artificial intelligence adding significant value with this data is now resulting in blocking an additional 3.2 million attacks every day. We expect more advancements from our artificial intelligence as we further integrate our network and endpoint data. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform ingests this threat intelligence and combines it with robust integrated functionality across our user, web, information, and messaging solutions.", "Turning to a representative customer example, recently one of the world's largest food and drug retailers with over 60,000 users embarked upon an initiative to move to the cloud and upgrade their security infrastructure. Our sales team moved the conversation with the customer from speaking about a combination of point solutions to articulating the benefits of our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. We delivered a solution that improved the customer's security posture and reduced their expense. Given the increased Symantec footprint, this customer is now paying approximately 60% more to Symantec but reduced their overall security spend by an estimated 25% and took a major step forward in their security posture. We expect these type of win-win opportunities to be commonplace as companies are looking for integrated platforms as they struggle with technology sprawl and runaway costs due to isolated point vendors.", "Now let me highlight our leadership in cloud security. In order for the enterprise customer to take advantage of the cloud, security solutions must be incorporated that reduce the risks inherent in the cloud generation. All of our major solutions are now delivering in the cloud and designed for the new risks our customers are facing. For example, we have an industry-leading approach to securing cloud applications. We have combined cloud proxy, CASB, Data Loss Prevention, and multi-factor authentication into one complete offering that addresses these new risks. We believe we are the only company that has all of these major components and we'll enjoy this position for the foreseeable future. When compared to the alternatives of an internal IT shop procuring and integrating multiple solutions from point vendors, we are an obvious choice. In Q4 we saw a substantial traction with our entire cloud security portfolio. As an example of our success, during the quarter we won a large deal at a major technology services company that is undergoing a cloud transformation. The customer took the first steps in adopting this platform for their internal environment with the purchase of our cloud proxy and DLP. This was a highly competitive win and a massive endorsement to our strength in cloud security given how cloud-centric IT services organizations are today. We see many deals in the pipeline that are similar in nature.", "Turning to our endpoint security solution, endpoint security is a key component of our platform and its success has resulted in customers cross buying additional components of our cyber defense platform. In Q4, we saw continued success with SEP 14 from both a product and sales standpoint. SEP 14 detection rates have improved 26% compared to SEP 12. Competitive wins are increasing and SEP 14 has not witnessed a significant technical loss. For example we replaced a major competitor at a large financial services company. There were multiple drivers of the win including SEP integration with ProxySG and our superior machine learning capabilities. The competitive landscape is turning in our favor with a leading-market share endpoint vendor removed from a third party endpoint leadership quadrant as well as smaller endpoint providers experiencing some recent significant missteps. Overall we see signs of increasing win rates and expect renewal metrics to improve over the medium term.", "In addition, Endpoint Detection and Response, EDR, is an important part of the endpoint market that is garnering attention from customers. The next release of our converged endpoint plus EDR solution is launching soon. As we introduce this new version of converged endpoint plus EDR into our installed base, we expect to have a similar impact to the current point EDR solution vendors as SEP 14 is having on point machine learning and exploit prevention vendors. For example, during the fourth quarter we closed a nearly 180,000 endpoint win with a large IT services company that included our EDR and endpoint security. The customer was overwhelmed with the high volume of alerts across 40 countries and was seeking to consolidate their endpoint security to a single vendor. We won due to our strong technology and single agent architecture. This win involved replacing two competitors out of our customer's endpoint environment. We have made strong progress in EDR and are pleased with our first year in the market closing approximately 600 customers. We believe, given our rapid adoption, we are already a meaningful player in the EDR market one year after launch. This is an example of our competitive advantage enabled by our platform.", "In summary on endpoint progress, the power of our platform improves the security posture of our customers while enabling them to drive down their overall security cost per employee. The combination of cloud proxy, CASB, DLP, and multi-factor authentication enables the cloud generation. With SEP 14, we are now the leading next generation endpoint provider and will further extend our leadership with the introduction of the converged endpoint and EDR.", "Now onto our Consumer Security segment, the acquisition of LifeLock was a catalyst that expanded the business on to a new market category of Consumer Digital Safety. We believe digital safety increases our addressable market to an estimated $10 billion growing in the high single digits. We have expanded our value proposition by offering a comprehensive digital safety solution that delivers more value to the customer than PC malware protection alone and protects all aspects of a consumer's digital life including their information, identities, devices, homes and families.", "In addition, we now have a much larger demand generation budget for enhancing our brand and driving new customer acquisitions. We expect this competitive differentiation will fuel sustainable long-term growth in new customers and retention metrics. During the quarter we are already seeing signs that the strategy is working. Norton results were better than our outlook driven by renewal metrics and new products such as mobile solutions and privacy technology. We see a significant opportunity to deliver more value to our loyal customers which we will expand upon in more detail at the Financial Analyst Day. At a high level, there are multiple growth drivers that underpin our digital safety strategy.", "Let me outline the major components. First, leverage our larger demand generation. By combining Norton and LifeLock we have substantially increased our demand generation engine that can inform the market of our expanded value proposition. Our combined demand generation spend nearly triples compared to Norton stand-alone, and we expect it will provide greater economies of scale. For example, we recently rolled out a co-branded marketing campaign by leveraging LifeLock's existing paid TV and radio advertising spend.", "Second, transitioning to a digital safety offering. Another lever for growth is transitioning our loyal Norton customer base to our digital safety bundle We began our journey to digital safety by cross selling new offerings such as Wi-Fi privacy and our upcoming home IT security and next generation parental control solution, Norton Core. We have already begun the preliminary phases of cross selling Norton into the LifeLock base through a referral process. And in June, we plan to begin to cross-sell the LifeLock and Norton bundle, which we believe has potential to drive upside to our current outlook. As a reminder, identity protection customers pay 2 to 3 times more for protecting their identity than the average selling price of PC malware protection. We were purposely measured in our cross-sell launch of LifeLock into the Norton base to ensure our internal systems and processes were tightly aligned. Moreover, with approximately 50% of the Norton installed base outside the U.S., international expansion of the digital safety bundle is a large opportunity.", "Third, mobile security. Mobile users increased 50% year over year driven by both Android and iOS growth. In April, we signed an agreement with a large international telco to deliver Norton Mobile protection for their customer base, which is a new route to over 43 million wireless subscribers. We are also seeing an uptick in demand of mobile private VPN due to recent legislation that permits ISPs to share customers' internet activity.", "Finally, Norton Core, which has the potential to be a significant growth driver. Norton Core is an exciting extension to our digital safety platform. We are seeing continued strong reception from partners and industry participants. We expect the combined consumer business to reach growth adjusted for acquisitions by the first half of fiscal 2018. We plan to accomplish this while maintaining industry leading profitability, which provides us with the flexibility to continue investing in driving long term growth in our Consumer Digital Safety business.", "Turning to recent developments related to our website security solution. As you may be aware, in late March, Google put forth a proposal that, if implemented, would introduce major changes to the processes and operations that are standard across our industry, including our Certificate Authority business. Since that time, we've been engaged in conversations with Google, Mozilla, and other members of the CA community to seek input on our counter proposal that we believe minimizes business disruption for our customers and improves trust in Symantec's CA business. We believe we will find a mutually agreeable path forward that is in the best interest of our customers, and we expect discussions around our proposal to continue and have factored our current expectations around this headwind into our financial outlook.", "Now, I would like to address the transformation of the overall Symantec business and our operational commitments. We indicated there was a strong industrial logic to our transformation. Exiting fiscal 2017, we believe this industrial logic is materializing across the business. Last June, we committed to a set of cost savings and synergies. We're achieving these savings at a faster pace than originally anticipated and we are ahead of plan exiting fiscal 2017. Exiting fiscal 2017, the financial profile of Symantec has substantially improved from what would have been the picture not even a year ago. For example, Enterprise Security operating margins improved from 5% in fiscal year 2016 to 13% in fiscal year 2017 and we are forecasting exiting fiscal year 2018 with over 30% enterprise operating margins. Fiscal 2018 begins the second half of our execution plan to fundamentally transform Symantec across both revenue growth and increased profitability.", "As we exit fiscal year 2018, at the highest level, we expect organic revenue growth for each of our segments, and total organic revenue growth for the company in the mid-single digits with market leading operating margins, in Enterprise Security above 30% and in Consumer Security above 40%. We are entering the year with significant operational improvements in our go-to-market processes and have simplified the demand chain and programs to our partners reducing substantial complexity across the business. We have made substantial transformational changes in our Enterprise Security segment related to SKUs, price lists, partners and systems. And today, we have a very capable and proven team that can navigate integration complexity and continue to focus on disciplined operational execution. We have combined two quota carrying sales forces thus increasing our productive sales capacity. From the close of the Blue Coat transaction through the end of fiscal year 2017, we effectively maintained the equivalent of 2 sales reps per named account, with divided territories. Over the last nine months, we have worked to align our sales capacity more efficiently. We are confident that our efforts are already translating to results, however, we believe it is prudent to begin the fiscal year 2018 Q1 with modest close rate assumptions, allowing for additional sales capacity to take effect.", "In summary, the new Symantec has established significant competitive differentiation, which allows us the financial flexibility to maximize our investment in cyber security, which greatly benefits our customers, employees and shareholders. The industrial logic around the Symantec and Blue Coat combination is stronger than ever, and we are combining leading product innovation with unmatched scale, which in our view, is leading to significant competitive advantages. The Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is resonating with customers and the opportunities to significantly expand our wallet share are materializing. We have transformed our Consumer business from PC malware protection to Consumer Digital Safety. This brings significant competitive differentiation and we expect will fuel sustainable long-term growth. We are forecasting that our Norton customers will purchase LifeLock, hence, returning the consumer business to organic growth. We are on track to deliver long-term sustainable growth with leading profitability across both our Enterprise Security and Consumer segments. And we are on track with our expectations to exit fiscal 2018 with organic growth accelerating into the mid single digits with total non-GAAP operating margins over 35%.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Nick to provide more financial detail.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you Greg and good afternoon everyone. Today I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 financial results. I will give you context to our segment performance and our cost savings, synergies and the substantial integration, transformation and business process changes we are executing as we round out fiscal year 2017 and enter fiscal year 2018. And I will review with you details around our fiscal year 2018 and first quarter fiscal year 2018 financial outlook. We have also made additional details including reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures such as amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation available in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "Before I review our results, I would like to remind you that our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial guidance provided on February 1 did not include a contribution from the LifeLock acquisition, which subsequently closed on February 9. In our prepared remarks last quarter, we stated that we expected LifeLock to contribute just under $100 million of revenue for the stub period in our Q4, and be $0.01 dilutive to Symantec earnings per share.", "Let me start with an overview of our Q4 financial results. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1.176 billion, up 36% on a constant currency basis. For the stub period, LifeLock contributed $100 million to revenue during the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. Excluding LifeLock, revenue was $1.076 billion compared to our guidance of $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion. While business activity was consistent with our expectations for Q4, we saw the subscription mix within our Blue Coat products above expectations, which had an impact on end period revenue in the quarter. I will expand upon this later in more detail. Overall organic revenue performance was approximately flat, excluding revenue from the Blue Coat and LifeLock acquisitions, with better than expected results in Consumer Security, and growth in Enterprise Security. This is an improvement of 6 points compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 27%. Excluding LifeLock, our operating margin was 29%, at the high end of our guided range of 27% to 29%. Operationally, our strong non-GAAP operating margin was driven by continued execution against our cost savings initiatives and synergies. Fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.28 and included a $0.01 headwind from LifeLock as we anticipated. Excluding LifeLock, fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.29, at the high end of our $0.27 to $0.29 guidance range.", "GAAP earnings per share reflects two elements that were not incorporated in our prior guidance. First, our preliminary valuation of LifeLock, and the related purchase price adjustments, such as revenue and intangibles, and other items we do not include in our non-GAAP earnings. And second, stock based compensation expense, relating not only to LifeLock, but also our alignment of our performance based executive compensation with shareholder interests.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding increased by 5 million shares to 663 million shares relative to our guidance of 658 million shares, due to the impact from our convertible notes, driven by increased share price and the timing of our share repurchase program. Please see the dilution tables posted to our Investor Relations website where you can see the impact to diluted share count from the convertible notes at various stock prices.", "Finally, cash from operations during the quarter was $353 million.", "Now let's review our operating segment performance for Q4 in a bit more detail; first, I'll review the performance of Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment non-GAAP revenue was $689 million and grew 49% year over year. Excluding acquisitions, Enterprise Security organically grew 2%. Enterprise non-GAAP operating margin was 16%, up 17 points year over year. As Greg stated, we believe our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform will improve the security posture of our customers and considerably reduces their per user cyber security costs, while at the same time increasing our annual wallet share per employee.", "As we evolve our business to selling integrated solutions, it will become more challenging to delineate growth by each product line on a quarterly basis. That said, we are clearly seeing an improvement in our underlying business. Let me provide three examples of products within our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. During the fourth quarter, endpoint security grew in the low single digits year over year. .cloud, our SaaS based email security grew over 20% year over year and total email has now inflected to growth of 7%. For the 11 months through the end of our fiscal year, revenue related to Blue Coat products is up 10% year over year. At our Financial Analyst Day, we will discuss metrics that are aligned to how we are managing the business going forward, with examples to show how we are increasing wallet share per protected user through cross buying of our platform, while enabling our customers to improve their security postures through use of our products.", "Now turning to Consumer Security, our Consumer Security segment non-GAAP revenue for Q4 was $487 million and grew 21% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 42%. Excluding LifeLock, Consumer Security was down 3%, which improved sequentially from the third quarter and versus our guidance of down 4% to down 3%. The improved revenue performance was mainly driven by continued improvement in Norton renewal metrics and to a lesser extent a tailwind from new offerings. LifeLock contributed $100 million to revenue which was higher than our expectations for the stub period. The underlying LifeLock metrics were strong and we have included a summary in the CFO commentary for your review.", "Now turning to a summary of fiscal year 2017, overall, fiscal year 2017 was a year of important change for our business. As Greg indicated, we are driving significant integration, transformation and business process change across the company, and balancing financial performance as we do so. From a financial perspective, we performed well in fiscal 2017 across all metrics. On our last earnings conference call, we narrowed our fiscal year 2017 currency adjusted revenue growth to the high end of our previous range and raised our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range, despite headwinds from foreign currency and fully diluted share count. Fiscal year 2017 revenue excluding LifeLock was $4.063 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis. Revenue was $4.163 billion including the stub period of revenue contribution from LifeLock.", "Organic revenue growth, excluding Blue Coat and LifeLock, was down just under 3% compared to our original fiscal year 2017 guidance of down 4% to down 1%, and our performance in fiscal year 2016, down 5%. On an organic basis, Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, within our original fiscal year 2017 guidance of down 3% to down 6%. On an organic basis, Enterprise Security revenue was down 1% compared to our original fiscal year 2017 guidance of down 2% to flat.", "Non-GAAP operating margin excluding LifeLock was 29%, consistent with our prior guidance. We completed the year with over $300 million of run rate cost savings and integration synergies, ahead of our plans. Including LifeLock, non-GAAP operating margin remained at 29%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.18, including a $0.01 headwind from LifeLock, which is an increase of 15% year over year and above our original guidance of $1.06 to $1.10 provided in May 2016. Cash flow from operations for the full year was negative $220 million but included $887 million in cash tax payments related to the sale of Veritas and $141 million of restructuring and separation payments.", "With respect to our cost savings initiatives and acquisition integration synergies, on prior calls, we discussed that our total cost savings initiatives are comprised of $400 million in net cost efficiencies on the Symantec business and $150 million in Blue Coat cost synergies to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2018. In addition, at acquisition announcement, we communicated $80 million of cost synergies for LifeLock by fiscal year 2020, $30 million of which we expect to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2018. As of the end of fiscal year 2017, we have achieved over $300 million of the $550 million in net cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies, which is faster than our original plan. We are also tracking well to achieve the LifeLock synergies of $30 million this year and $80 million by fiscal year 2020.", "Now turning to balance sheet and capital allocation, as of March 31, we had $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $8.3 billion in gross debt including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We expect to complete our $500 million accelerated share repurchase before the end of our fiscal first quarter and have $800 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization.", "Now let me provide you context on how we are entering fiscal year 2018. We have fundamentally transformed both our Enterprise and Consumer Security businesses and are now the largest pure-play cyber security company. Our Enterprise Security business is positioned with a robust and Integrated Cyber Defense Platform that increases the return on investment our customers realize from their security spend. The acquisition of LifeLock was a catalyst that enabled our Consumer business to expand into a new market category of Consumer Digital Safety.", "With respect to our financial outlook, I want to acknowledge that given the two acquisitions and all of the integration, transformation and business process changes we are executing, investors' financial models need to be updated. We are giving you as much information on this call as we can, and expect to use our Financial Analyst Day to further give you context on the drivers of the financials for each of our business segments and the overall corporation.", "Let me start with the full year, then provide our first quarter outlook. Further detail and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and guidance are available in the CFO commentary. For the full year, we expect revenue to increase to $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion at guided rates, which is approximately 3% constant currency growth adjusted for acquisitions at the midpoint. We have incorporated in our guidance an expectation of a further shift to subscription in our Blue Coat network products versus fiscal year 2017, which reflects the recent increase in customers choosing our cloud offerings. This shift benefits future visibility to revenue and end year deferred revenue and cash flow. End year revenue from business moving to subscription will naturally be lower.", "We have also incorporated in our guidance our revenue expectations for our website security business due to the ongoing dispute with Google and the uncertainty it has created for customers. From a seasonality standpoint we expect the mix of our $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion of revenue to be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, with about a 2 point shift from the first half, second half revenue mix we saw in the base Symantec business in fiscal year 2017. We believe this is reasonable, given the substantial transformation and business process changes we made in our Enterprise segment at the beginning of the fiscal year.", "In Consumer, we are launching our digital safety offerings, which are subscription offerings generated by our Norton and LifeLock teams. The combination of these actions in Enterprise and Consumer set us up extremely well to realize fully the value propositions of our transformative acquisitions. That said, the benefits to revenue will accrue later in the fiscal year, as all of the changes take root. For fiscal year 2018, we expect Enterprise Security growth adjusted for acquisitions of 3% to 5%, and Consumer Security growth adjusted for acquisitions of 1% to 3%. We expect that Consumer Security will show growth adjusted for acquisitions in the first half of the fiscal year. As Greg indicated, we expect the company to be exiting fiscal year 2018 at a revenue growth rate in the mid-single digits. We expect non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2018 of 36% to 37%, up 8 to 9 points in constant currency versus fiscal year 2017.", "We exited fiscal year 2017 ahead of plan on our cost savings and synergy commitments, and expect to maintain our cadence in fiscal year 2018. We remain on track to exiting fiscal year 2018 with our cost savings and Blue Coat synergy programs largely complete. As it relates to the LifeLock synergies, we remain on plan to achieve the $30 million in synergies we committed to by the end of fiscal year 2018 and the $80 million by the end of fiscal year 2020. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.75 to $1.85 for fiscal year 2018, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, and up 52% to 61% versus fiscal year 2017 in constant currency.", "We expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5%, up 50 basis points from fiscal year 2017 and driven by our mix of business. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 675 million, up from 645 million in fiscal year 2017 and driven by increased share price and its impact on our convertible notes and options. We have not built substantial share repurchases into our share count estimates as our focus, from a capital allocation perspective, is on debt reduction. We plan to pay down a portion of our debt outstanding in fiscal year 2018. We have repaid $810 million of pre-payable debt so far this quarter and expect to retire our $600 million bond due in June. We also continue to maintain our regular quarterly dividend.", "Before I turn to our first quarter outlook, I would like to discuss the progression of our fiscal 2018 outlook. In June 2016 when we laid out our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, the euro was trading at $1.13 and our underlying share count assumption was 585 million, which implied fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP net income of approximately $1 billion. Our fiscal year 2018 guidance today implies substantial non-GAAP net income improvement versus that initial estimate. At the same time, the euro has depreciated 5% causing an incremental $0.05 headwind to that guidance. Our share price has appreciated by approximately 70%, resulting in approximately 35 million shares of dilution from our convertible debt. The considerable share price appreciation also resulted in our share repurchase program retiring less shares than we had previously anticipated. And in addition, we reallocated a portion of the previously planned share repurchase for the LifeLock acquisition which we determined to be a better use of shareholder capital. Many of our existing long-term focused shareholders are well aware of these moving parts, but for those that are new to Symantec, we believe it is helpful to frame the changes over this timeframe and since this initial fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP EPS range was issued, to where we are today.", "Moving to our first quarter outlook, given the integration of our acquisitions, business process changes, and modification to sales coverage we put in place at the beginning of April, as well as the shift to more subscription business, we believe it is prudent to set measured first quarter guidance. We expect non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter to be up 37% to 40%, which at guided rates translates to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect Enterprise revenues to increase 36% to 40% and Consumer revenue to increase 38% to 40%. We expect operating margins to be 27% to 29%, and expand sequentially each quarter from there. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 to $0.32 and an underlying share count of 667 million shares. We will share additional details on the outlook of each of our businesses at our Financial Analyst Day in June.", "So in summary, business activity and momentum with customers was strong as we exited fiscal year 2017. Financially, we saw stronger than expected subscription in our product mix, which impacted end period revenue, but was more than offset by our cost management, driving operating margins and earnings to the high end of our prior guidance. At the same time, our integration, transformation and business process work is going well and is setting us on firm footing to realize the value propositions we outlined to you related to the acquisitions in both our Enterprise and Consumer business segments. Our financial guidance for fiscal year 2018 reflects our work and the fundamental change taking place at Symantec. From a revenue perspective, we expect to see the benefits accrue later in the year, as all of the changes take root and yield results. With 8 to 9 points of operating margin growth, and 52% to 61% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year 2018, we believe the company will be set on a strong trajectory of long term sustainable growth with leading profitability for the future.", "Thank you for your time and let me turn the call back over to Greg.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you, Nick. Jon, I'll ask you to lead the Q&A.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Operator, please take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer and Company.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Greg, Nick, Jon. I want to start by focusing on the endpoint side of the equation. Progress on EDR without a doubt seemed to be encouraging given some of the metrics and data you disclosed in your prepared remarks. Greg, can you talk to us about some of the market trends driving Endpoint Detection and Response?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yes, so I think the endpoint is a busy space at the moment, and one of the things that we're really into is delivering a converged endpoint to try to reduce some of the chaos and expense in our customers as we had described in one of the examples. And so we have I think closed the gap on any of the AI-based [stimulus] detection machine learning aspects of the endpoint and always had the best sort of detection technologies that we had. And recently, we had turned our energy onto the EDR front. EDR is a very important piece. It is really trying to get to the repair and response to malware events or cyber security events. We have entered the market last year with that and I think in our prepared remarks we talked about some substantial success in that first year and we really look forward to that converged solution coming into the release of our SEP 14 platform in the very near future. From a customer wallet point of view, there is a wallet open for EDR at the moment in the enterprise, and we do expect to take a good piece of that.", "And I think another big benefit for us is the effect of that capability in our product in our renewal and we do expect our renewal rates on endpoint to increase. We are also delivering other endpoint technology that is great. We have a future release coming up this year of endpoint integrated very tightly with our proxy technology that will change the game in being able to respond and detect problems. And we have a great cross sell opportunity for endpoint DLP, which is very powerful in the cloud generation for protecting enterprise data from the endpoint to the cloud. So you put all that together, we also think there is a great opportunity for us to take share as some of the big market share leaders have had some headwinds in third party analysis.", "And as mentioned, in our prepared remarks, it had reports come out that have sort of downgraded their capability. We expect to step into some of that share also. One of the other points I'd like to make about the remarks in our conference call is the traditional Symantec Enterprise Security business grew this quarter in Q4. And remember comments from the prior call where that was slightly negative and we had felt good about our opportunity to bring that back to growth. And that was delivered in Q4.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie.", "Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi, thank you guys for taking my question. Greg, I wanted to start with you. Could you maybe expand a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of the subscription adoption in Blue Coat, and maybe obviously $100 million run rate is quite large so how is that impacting the product's revenue? And then a second question for you, Nick. We published on the Google SSL issue recently, and we attempted to pin down some impact it would have on your ability to raise EPS outlook, and then in your prepared comments you are calling this out as a factor in your raise of the fiscal year 2018 outlook. And I'm hoping you can help me also quantify if we're in the right ballpark in terms of the adverse impact we're assessing on that as well.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, so I'll start off. I think with the Blue Coat question. So first we did see more subscription. I think there's a couple of things that are going on there. First of all, we have now achieved feature parity with the Blue Coat solution, whether it be the hardware appliance, the VAs that we deployed for software defined network solutions and also the pure cloud offering. So we want to provide our products to customers the way they want to buy them. And as we see more and more cloud adoption in the enterprise, we now offer our customers the three different versions of how to take that technology on. In the fourth quarter, we saw a more than what we had planned adoption of the cloud and subscription versions of those form factors. Very good result because that is proof that the Symantec technology is being designed into the future network architectures of some of our large enterprise customers. We think that there's going to be more of that in the future, and hence, we have on many conference calls, we have put an underscore on mix as we go forward and we do see, as the cloud generation takes off, more of that mix. We also have seen great traction with our Blue Coat subscription and Blue Coat cloud technology. That is something that is growing at a very strong clip.", "And as we reported in our remarks, that 67% growth rate at the sort of revenue zip code, we do expect a strong future there. So that hits the current period with tailwinds into the deferred revenue for the future. But we really also want to point out it's difficult to decipher the deferred revenue, and Nick can make comments on that later or at the Analyst Day. But I think it's really important to understand that we did see the expected levels of business in the Blue Coat products in Q4, and we saw a shift of some of the form factor with which it is purchased, which affected some of the end period revenue. Okay, so the business was in good shape. And we're happy with the outcome there.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "So, Sarah, it's Nick. Thanks for the question. So maybe first of all, let me just frame the general size of the business, around $350 million in that type of a range. A substantial amount of the business especially as we enter a year in, in Q1 will come off the balance sheet. So, obviously I wanted to size it, but as Greg indicated in his comments, we're having a set of conversations and discussions around our business, around the environment with Google and others. So we don't want to get into too much detail and granularity on that at this point in time because those are ongoing discussions, but we feel good about those that are happening. So, suffice it to say, I think it's important to understand the relative size of the business versus the rest of the portfolio. A substantial amount of the business comes off the balance sheet. So obviously that's a risk mitigator in terms of end quarter or quarterly revenue streams and contribution to EPS. But it's certainly something that we think about on the go forward.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.", "Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you. This is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. I just wanted to put a finer point on the Q1 guide. So it seems like there's a number of factors that potentially could drive some conservatism. You talked about the certificate business, the shift towards subscription, but you also noted a more modest close rate assumption, just given the integration of the sales force. So I'm wondering if you could just maybe put a little bit of a finer point around those factors if you could help quantify it. And then in terms of the integration of the sales force, where are we in this process and will that kind of extend beyond Q1?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Hey, Melissa. Thank you. Very good questions. So two things are happening and just put an underscore around the product mix that we described and also the ramp in sales. And we did talk in our prepared remarks about two things. We have put a substantial amount of work into the back office systems and what we have done in our demand chain and our channel. That has gone into effect coming out of Q4 and into the first quarter of this fiscal year. And we have spent a lot of time planning and preparing the sort of realignment of our sales force where we used to have that sales force overlap on a bunch of named accounts. We have now worked for the last nine months to align them to the market. And we are just signaling to folks that it will take a little bit of time for that newly-aligned field to get productive. Okay? And so those are two things. And I'll pass the call over \u2013 the question over to Nick to hit a couple of these as well.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, Melissa, maybe just to put a point on the non-sales side for a second because Greg's obviously incredibly close to that. But I wanted to also highlight the amount of work that the enterprise team has been doing in the integration activities. And because we are touching every SKU, every disty, every channel partner, all the price lists. The team's been training the sales force since October/November timeframe. There's been a significant \u2013 and then the system side of the fence where the team here has really broken through multiple years of stuff that hasn't been integrated to make it integrated. So a lot of work has been done. We look at that as a real positive in terms of the future, in terms of traction, in terms of visibility to our business and all of those pieces. Obviously that all landed at the beginning of the quarter, and we want to be conscious of that.", "And want to be measured when we think about how fast an individual can pick up all this new stuff and be at 100% capacity with it. Everything feels good, and I think the team is very, very excited about all that change. But just want to be conscious of it, when we pull together the financial side of the fence for Q1. And obviously I indicated in the scripted commentary, also our thoughts around where the revenue falls this year, and it's a different mix in terms of the proportions in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. That is obviously a discussion of what's going on, on the enterprise side here, and the ramp up that we expect to have, as well as the synergies on the consumer side with the bundles on LifeLock.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "I think that's a good point. Okay, the bundles are important. We mentioned that we are the only vendor in the market in our prepared remarks with the four major pieces of CloudStack, and others really taking what used to be four separate sort of pieces of technology and putting them together. That's an example of a bundle. And when we put it together, how that gets purchased and recognized is different than it may be historically. And I think the other piece that's really, really important is we did do the hard work for those of you who are long-term, we did go after the massive number of different kinds of distribution contracts. Thousands and thousands of SKUs, and reduced those things to a modern demand chain, modern set of distribution contracts and a much, much simplified price book for our products, and so we are going after long-term complexity take-down. And the other piece, I think, that definitely makes me feel good about things is our sales attrition is extremely low. And we come out of a fiscal year with just everybody hit all their \u2013 the usual cohort of very good folks did well, and now coming into this year, you usually get a spike in attrition. We did not have that.", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Okay, next question.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.", "Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah, thanks guys. Greg, Enterprise Security, I believe grew 2% organically this quarter. I was wondering if you can provide a bit more granularity on actually how much of ES is growing versus declining. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, Blue Coat obviously enters a large refresh shortly, can you provide a little bit more color on the magnitude of the refresh, and maybe how you think about incorporating that into your full-year guide?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So, now let me start off by passing over the growth by product question to Nick, and he can knock some of that down, and I'll come back to the last one.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "And Matt, you're kind of getting into some stuff that we're looking forward to showing at Financial Analyst Day. So let me just give you some high level statistics. What we're looking at, and the teams, again, on the enterprise side has done a really good job here looking at the products and where we are on the products. And frankly we can group growers and great growers and others, and when we do those types of things, we've got a substantial element of the product on the ES side that are growing already in the mid to high single digits. And that incorporates some of the elements obviously from Blue Coat, from endpoint, et cetera, which we'll show you at the Financial Analyst Day. That is also reflecting only the front end of what we think we can do in terms of the combinations of products and products working together that Greg spoke to. We also indicated that looking at products is going to be difficult go forward as we bundle, but we want to try to give you some of that perspective the best we can. And I'll point you to Financial Analyst Day for some of that material.", "We also acknowledge that there's elements of the portfolio that are shrinking, right? And that's a small proportion of the whole. When we break it into those types of proportions, we feel that that shrink is going to moderate over the course of the year as some of these things just become less and less important. But we do expect to show you that kind of what set of products are in what camp, if you will, to give you a perspective of what we're working with, and then how that looks going forward, and how we're going to be combining things go forward. But as I indicated in the scripted remarks, I think that us talking about specific products and numbers for specific products in any one quarter, we're going to be doing a lot less of.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah. And Matt, moving to your next question about the Blue Coat refresh, I think there's \u2013 we have I would say a very good reputation in the market with respect to the products and technologies that Blue Coat delivered to our customers, and that refresh is coming from having looked at Blue Coat before. What you have is a high end of enterprise and middle enterprise solution that's very popular in that cohort. And so that cohort is migrating to the cloud and really landing in what we call a hybrid cloud situation, where they definitely have need store on premise, hardware in some environments and other stuff they'd like to pick up just purely from the cloud.", "And for those who have built the virtual infrastructure like the virtualization capabilities, they want to be able to pick this stuff up in a software defined space. So as we roll into the refresh, which really happens in FY 2018, and then throughout FY 2019 in healthy numbers, nothing's happened to the size of it. We do see like we saw in Q4, we expect to see a better natural mix shift to the software defined and pure cloud choices for that, which we think are very good. If you look at a competitive displacement of that, we think we have a better stack for that technology than any other vendor, and we can give it to you how you want to buy it. And that's how we're approaching the refresh is if you want it in cloud, you want it in software defined, you want it in appliances, you tell us, we give it to you. And we think that when you look at the feature set of that set of capabilities, it is extremely differentiated. It is better than anything else on the market. So we are still planning on that going well, and that also is in our thoughts around a strong second half and also a very strong 2019. Okay?", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "All right, thanks for taking the question. I apologize for the background noise here, but first question on the endpoint, maybe just a follow-up. Can you just give us any more color on the endpoint integration with ProxySG that you had mentioned and how that plays into the conversation with customers? And then second, can you just give also an update on your discussions with cable MSOs, or any other home router providers and how they need to pull your Norton software on top of their hardware in addition to the Norton Core offering that you're about to launch. Thanks.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, no problem. So let me take on the Norton Core one first, and then I'll circle back to the private. So in the Norton Core discussion, we have seen from the pre-launch of the product at the CES Show around the start of January, we've seen a continuing build in substantial interest both from kind of end customers as well as cable, broadband, telecom operators and other folks that have been traditional channels for more malware oriented technology. So we think that the future is bright for Core, and we've had some very, very good business interactions with some of those providers. We don't have \u2013 we don't want to mess up any of our announcements that may happen in the future by talking about that on this call, but I would say that we still are very optimistic about Core.", "And because of the value proposition, and I think the growing awareness of the plethora of internet enabled devices in the home and being able to take care of that. So we like the business activity around Core, and we think as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the growth driver from that is definitely a reason for optimism. For the first part of your question is really about endpoint and Proxy. And I think that we've delivered. One thing that we talked about on the call, which is very powerful, which is the threat telemetry into our AI that comes from the integration of endpoint and our Proxy technology. And what that means is if we know about something in the web that's bad, the endpoints are aware of that and they won't even initiate those kind of connections when the user is requesting those or when malware is trying to go to those. Also, modern malware comes to you in lots of pieces.", "It can be taking a long time with different forms of getting there. When we detect that and we go and stitch that back together, we can vaccinate all of those avenues in the network, and thus shut down those infections, and so we really like what's happening right now in our telemetry and the AI associated with it. When we first launched it, we talked about blocking 300-and-some-thousand events per day, and that's gotten smarter over time. And is now into the 3-plus million per day. And so that is extremely encouraging. What's happening next in conjunction with what we're doing in EDR is being able to have our network technology reach back to the client when they see something that they don't understand or something that's new or something that's anomalistic, and ask what's on the other end of this? What is requesting this? What is this?", "And when we see kind of a Twitter tweet that didn't come from a Twitter app or a browser, we would get very interested in that, and that EDR meets ProxySG. And our security analytics technology delivers a solution that we think will seriously differentiate us in the market. We know a lot about it and we're working hard towards that goal. Additionally, we have some more work we're doing with our client multi-factor authenticator to also enlist our users when we something that's anomalistic, and actually ask them, hey, we noticed this. Are you actually copying all these files right now? And we get a yes or no out of that, and that can really also enlist a very different set of remediation and detection capability. So we are driving innovation in network meets endpoint in a huge way and we are \u2013 our engineers are super excited about what's going on. And they run into my office quite often to show me something cool, and I think we're going to excite people as we start to release those pieces of technology where the rest of our network technology meets endpoint.", "Operator", "And our next...", "Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp.", "Next question. I think we have time for one more.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, go ahead.", "Operator", "Indeed. Our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital.", "Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Two questions if I may, first maybe for Greg. Greg, can you just talk about EDR pricing and how that might change just on a unit basis for a customer on SEP 14 adding EDR? And then the second question maybe for you, Nick, on the consumer side, a lot of talk about the LifeLock and Norton bundles. How impactful could that bundle be on your 2018 revenue guide?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Okay. So on the pricing side of EDR, I think the market is definitely used to buying EDR right now. So there's definitely a wallet and a budget open for that. And we do expect to, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, to be able to go in and say where that becomes a Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform solution, we want to be able to give our customers a lower cost of ownership for that integrated product. And so, we expect to take down \u2013 we expect that we have an opportunity to, in that share of wallet, to get more for Symantec, but also give back a good chunk to our partners and our customer base.", "So we do think that we are a huge disruptor to the current state of play in EDR, because we do have a massive installed base. And in our business case, we also like to incent that renewal, which is very helpful for us because we do grow from two good pieces of security real estate, that and the endpoint, that and the network, and that and the big threat analytics. So we like growing and retaining our share at the endpoint. EDR will be a driver for that. I think the other piece that's quite good, we mentioned a very large case where we won an EDR account in our prepared remarks against all of the who's who. We also entered the market just in FY 2017 with EDR, and we did get a very strong set of installs around that that were competitive. So you mentioned the pricing. I think that's still kind of TBD from a list MSRP kind of situation when coupled with the next version of SEP 14. We do expect that to be more for Symantec, less for our customer. Okay?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "And then maybe just a couple of points on the Norton side of the fence or I should say on the consumer side of the fence with digital safety strategy. So first of all, I think \u2013 let me come up for a second and really acknowledge what's happened over the past year. I think the results and the top line results have continued to get better, and we've been better than, and the team has driven better than expected results each quarter. With LifeLock, the actual \u2013 the GAAP results are basically flat year-on-year, and I think nobody would have expected that. Obviously I realize there's a stub period in there for LifeLock, but as we project forward into FY 2018, we have a consumer organization that is growing and is growing organically.", "And I think that's really important based upon a couple of things. Some of them, we're seeing already, such as the renewal metrics, the mobile solutions, the privacy technology. And some of them are on the LifeLock side of the fence in the bundles between Norton and LifeLock. And we continue to be very, very positive on that interlink. There is \u2013 the last piece I'd say is between the two, we have a substantial demand gen budget. And we are utilizing that. We are doing all of the pieces in terms of building and getting those bundles ready. Greg mentioned some timing on some of that stuff in his prepared remarks. I'm going to point you to Financial Analyst Day again because I know that Fran will be spending much more time talking about it then as well. So we are very positive on it. I think what I don't want to do is have you think that it's only the bundles that are driving the betterment in consumer. It's the work that's going on in just blocking and tackling of the basics of renewals, on new products as well. But we feel very, very good about the prospects for consumer and for organic growth in FY 2018.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "We're forecasting organic growth in FY 2018 for consumer, and there's a lot of room for positive thoughts about how that's going to go.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So, I think that's it. We're out of time, overtime. And I'd just like to thank all of you for getting on the call and asking some great questions. And at this point, in the transformation of Symantec, I think we have achieved some outstanding results on the operational efficiencies and the margin optimization. And I think we are set up on an outcome for FY 2018 that we feel as management team is achievable. And we feel great about what happens coming out of FY 2018 into FY 2019, and that is something that we really look forward to the discussion at Financial Analyst Day. We'll put the coffee pot on early. It's going to be a lot of detail. There's a lot to discuss. And look forward to seeing you all in person I think in just a little less than a month on June 8.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Symantec's Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. I'd now turn the call over to Mr. Nate Pollack. Sir, you may begin.", "Nate Pollack - Symantec Corp.", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings results. We've posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations Events webpage. Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec's CEO, and Nick Noviello, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses those non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and annualizing future periods.", "We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and that investors benefit from understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.", "Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information.", "You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.", "Now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark. Go ahead, Greg.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you for joining us, and good afternoon.", "Q2 represented a strong quarter for Symantec and marks an inflection point in our journey of transformation. Our results came in at the mid-point of our revenue guidance and the lower end of our EPS guidance. With that said, we are very pleased with our Q2 results. Let me explain why.", "First, we completed many critical milestones this last quarter, including our $550 million Symantec and Blue Coat cost reduction and integration synergy program, as well as our year one $30 million LifeLock synergies. These cost reduction milestones were all achieved ahead of schedule and have resulted in significantly improved margins for our Enterprise segment and continued high margins for our Consumer segment. Yesterday, we also completed the divestiture of our Website Security and PKI solutions to DigiCert, which enhances our long-term growth potential and sharpens our focus.", "After the completion of these transformational initiatives, Symantec is now a profitable and growing business across both its Enterprise and Consumer segments. Our Enterprise business had a strong result in Q2. While Q2 revenue was flat from a year ago on an acquisition adjusted basis, deferred revenue for our Enterprise segment grew 12% year-over-year. We've also delivered 11 points of operating margin improvement in the Enterprise segment from a year ago, moving us towards our longer-term margin targets. Our cross-selling strategy is working. More and more customers are choosing to standardize on our Integrated Cyber Defense platform because of our superior protection, cross-product integration, and lower overall cost of ownership.", "Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi-product deals, which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures. These trends are however also affecting our in-period revenue recognition. The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud, subscription and virtual appliance products in multi-product deals. We anticipated this mix shift in our remarks at our last Financial Analyst Day, but the shift is happening faster than we expected. Although these trends affected in-quarter revenue recognition for our Enterprise segment in Q2, they are positive leading indicators of future growth. Nick will discuss this topic further in his prepared remarks.", "Our Consumer Digital Safety segment overachieved our Q2 revenue guidance through growth in direct subscribers and an increase in ARPU. Norton subscriber declines continued to moderate based on improved customer retention. We added a substantial number of new LifeLock members after the Equifax breach was announced in September, but this only marginally contributed to Q2 results. The cross-sell of the Digital Safety solution into the Norton install base is on track and we expect it to gain momentum through the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our confidence in the Consumer business, we are forecasting higher Consumer segment revenue growth for the second half, exiting fiscal year 2018 in the mid-single digit revenue growth. We're extremely excited about the future of our Consumer segment as we continue to define the new category of Digital Safety.", "For the second half of fiscal 2018, Symantec is well-positioned to achieve our plans. We have integrated our acquisitions and we have developed a compelling portfolio across Enterprise and Consumer. Our Enterprise sales capacity is now ramped and productive. And we have an Enterprise sales pipeline that supports our second half growth target, including a record number of deals over eight figures.", "Reaching our goals for the second half incorporates continued historical conversion rates of our pipeline, including these larger sales opportunities, and we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 revenue and EPS guidance, after adjusting for the impact of the divestiture of our Website Security and PKI solutions to DigiCert.", "Let me now discuss the threat environment. Last quarter, there were several major cyber-attacks that received wide-spread public attention. Symantec products fared very well in these incidents, and that performance has driven increased long-term interest in Symantec as well as reaffirmed our relevance and leadership in the industry.", "First, the Petya and WannaCry ransomware attacks caused significant and unprecedented economic damage to enterprises measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, making security top of mind in the board room as well as the general public. Ransomware attacks and cyber extortion are impacting enterprises as well as consumers. During the first six months of 2017, 42% of ransomware infections globally occurred inside the enterprise, up from 30% in 2016 and 29% in 2015.", "The Equifax breach was also a significant event last quarter, reminding all of us about the importance of digital safety. The Equifax breach is also a reminder for the enterprise boardroom that the protection of data is paramount. This reality coupled with regulations like GDPR make data protection more relevant than ever.", "A significant consumer concern discovered last month labeled the KRACK vulnerability, which consisted of a vulnerability in WiFi devices, makes it possible for an attacker to intercept Web traffic. This vulnerability is very difficult to patch and as a result will be a problem for years to come driving demand for our consumer VPN.", "We're also seeing a current trend of adversaries focusing on mobile devices. In October, our threat research team discovered eight apps on the Google Play store allowing the modification of characters in Minecraft Pocket Edition, but these apps actually contained a malware called Sockbot. The apps have been quietly building a botnet as well as generating ad revenue for the creators. We believe up to 2.6 million Android devices have downloaded and been infected with the Sockbot malware.", "We recently released our Mobile Threat Intelligence report that found that unpatched operating system vulnerabilities are prevalent in mobile. We predict that in the near future mobile cyberattacks will be the primary attack vector, even on closed operating systems, bolstering the demand for our recent acquisition of Skycure.", "In September, the Symantec threat research team uncovered new activity by the Dragonfly attack group, which has recently been conducting reconnaissance into the operations of energy firms, allowing them to now potentially sabotage and disrupt power distribution. This is an example of how our Symantec threat research team is a leader in discovering new threats and providing critical threat intelligence needed to block sophisticated attacks.", "Symantec has helped protect customers across the breadth of these threats and delivered substantial value to them during one of the most active attack quarters on record.", "Now turning to our Enterprise business. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is resonating with customers. As enterprises are rethinking their security architecture to deal with the evolving threat landscape, they are increasingly building their strategic security capabilities around Symantec.", "Now let's turn to a strategic component of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform, which is our endpoint. Last year, we laid out our roadmap for innovation on endpoint, and we have delivered on these commitments with SEP 14 as the cornerstone.", "Our latest major milestones were our releases last week of SEP 14.1, SEP Mobile, and ATP 3.0, our updated EDR product. With these releases, we're now delivering defense in depth across modern and traditional endpoints, providing an integrated, scalable, multilayer approach to endpoint protection that is delivered from a single agent. We are the first in the industry to deliver deception, mobile threat detection and EDR in a single agent architecture. This achievement has been high on the wish list for our enterprise customers, who have been suffering fatigue from sourcing and managing different endpoint technologies across multiple vendors. This also simplifies and optimizes enterprise IT environments, lowers costs, and improves security posture.", "SEP 14.1 represents a major new milestone for our Symantec Endpoint Protection product line and includes some breakthrough innovations. It helps our customers improve their security posture providing them actionable intelligence into suspicious files in their environment, and allows them to set aggressive protection policies for specific groups and devices. One key innovation in SEP 14.1 is our new Deception technology.", "SEP Deception uses sophisticated decoy to help customers uncover hidden adversaries who have been able to evade other defenses. We believe we're the only security vendor with this advanced technology integrated in our endpoint portfolio. SEP 14.1 product continues to be well received with more than one third of our endpoint customer base now running SEP 14, which is resulting in improved renewal rates. We're also seeing displacements accelerate against both legacy and next-gen endpoint providers.", "Our EDR solution, called ATP, has seen strong growth of 3x from a year ago, and we are now at over 7 million seats. ATP 3.0 further differentiates us adding a series of technology including file-less attack detection and enhanced adversary intelligence, and closes the gap versus our competition with flight recorder functionality. This flight recorder records all activity on the endpoint and provides valuable forensic data to incident responders with no new agent to install. We also introduced EDR Cloud last quarter for customers to quickly perform agentless scanning and automated investigation in environments without SEP.", "Adding to our endpoint differentiation, we now have the ability to defend closed operating systems. With the acquisition of Skycure, we now call SEP Mobile, we are a leader in iOS and Android mobile protection. SEP Mobile delivers multi-layered protection for mobile endpoints to customers to defend BYOD and corporate devices from advanced threats across Android, iOS, and Windows. We've also successfully integrated Skycure with our Global Intelligence Network, and we are already seeing great value from this data integration for our customers.", "Now turning to our network defense solutions. Symantec's secure gateway and Fireglass isolation technology differentiates our Integrated Cyber Defense platform. Isolation is a game-changer in threat defense and is available in cloud, on-premise, and hybrid configurations.", "The Internet is quickly going dark from encryption, which drives the need for Symantec across endpoint, email, and web. To this point, proxies are becoming more relevant as they are built to decrypt traffic efficiently and eliminate the encryption blind spot. In line with the increasing adoption of cloud applications in the enterprise, our cloud access security broker is experiencing rapid growth. Cloud access security brokers are an outstanding control for adding data protection and multi-factor authentication to cloud applications delivering security and compliance to our enterprise customers.", "Now for some customer examples that illustrate our Integrated Cyber Defense platform adoption. A large insurance company facing a proxy refresh chose to adopt the Integrated Cyber Defense platform extending their footprint from on-premise proxies to include the cloud proxy and adding on additional defensive capabilities of CASB, isolation, and sandbox components of our platform. This was driven by the ability to leverage integrations across these core solutions as well as integrating into their existing SEP endpoint deployment. This is a true platform win for Symantec, and showcases our cross-sell execution at the time of proxy refresh and how we mitigate against competitive loss from point vendors.", "Another example where we see traction is with vendor consolidation. Customers can avoid the overhead of integration and sustainment across multiple vendors by choosing to adopt our Integrated Cyber Defense platform. Stitching together a portfolio of point solutions is typically complex, risky, expensive and fragile.", "For example, a large medical device manufacturer who has been a long-time Symantec DLP customer, but an endpoint customer of one of our competitors, understood our vision and was impressed with our Integrated Cyber Defense platform. They purchased SEP, encryption, CASB, and cloud DLP, and cloud proxy for more than 30,000 seats. We were selected not only for technology innovation but also for our cross-product integrations, which this customer concluded will improve their security posture, simplify their IT environment, lower their total costs and increase their SOC productivity.", "Another example of vendor consolidation we are seeing involved one of Europe's largest retailers. This customer had been heavily invested in Symantec DLP and ProxySG, but last quarter purchased SEP and email.Cloud for more than 20,000 seats, displacing an incumbent competitor for endpoint and email. The customer chose us for our solid EDR capabilities in a single agent and they saw Symantec as a partner for their journey to Office 365.", "Q2 is typically a large government spending quarter. I'm pleased that we saw solid federal procurement for our portfolio. We closed several large deals with defense and government customers looking to build their security capabilities around Symantec.", "Moving to Consumer Digital Safety. With our acquisition of LifeLock, and the launch of Norton Core and our WiFi privacy solution, we have created the digital safety category that spans across consumers' devices and information, and extends to protect consumers' identity.", "The consumer threat landscape is evolving and demonstrates why consumers need a single partner in digital safety to protect their devices, identity, and home. LifeLock continues to have the strongest brand recognition for both identity protection and remediation. Many of our new customers stated that the Equifax breach was the proverbial last straw. They knew what LifeLock was, knew they eventually wanted it, but were postponing adoption of an identity protection solution. When the breach happened, they signed up for LifeLock. This speaks volumes to the strong brand recognition for LifeLock.", "One of the investment themes we discussed at the time of the LifeLock acquisition was the opportunity to cross-sell LifeLock into the Norton cohort. We're pleased with the solid early traction from our cross-selling campaign that launched in mid-September. We will have more to share on the progress of our cross-sell efforts when we discuss our Q3 results. We also remain excited about the opportunity to expand LifeLock into overseas markets.", "Our Norton product continues to be more relevant than ever and customer retention continues to improve. Recent headlines underscore that we are the most trusted brand in consumer security, which was reflected in our strong customer retention rate last quarter.", "As we spoke earlier, last month's KRACK vulnerability in the WiFi protocol highlights the importance of VPNs for consumers and how this is an important element for digital safety. We're seeing continued strong momentum in sales of our Norton WiFi VPN product. We also rolled out Norton Core last quarter. It has been well-received in the market and we will be expanding our rollout this quarter.", "The transformation of our Consumer segment is succeeding. We have exceeded our expected first half growth, adjusted for acquisition, as we laid out at Financial Analyst Day last June. We've transitioned our Consumer business from being focused on Norton Security for the PC and the Mac to a much broader digital safety solution and value proposition for the consumer. Our strategy is working and we expect we will be significantly ramping the expansion of Digital Safety over the next two quarters.", "In summary, we believe our Integrated Cyber Defense platform and Consumer Digital Safety vision is resonating more than ever with customers and we are leading with cutting-edge innovation across both segments.", "Now let me turn the call over to Nick to discuss the financials.", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Thank you Greg and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please note we've posted supplemental materials and CFO commentary to our Investor Relations website.", "There are a set of topics and highlights I would like to walk through with you today. First, I'll review our fiscal Q2 results. Second, we will run through the significant milestone we have reached in our cost reduction and integration synergy initiatives. Third, with the announcement of the divestiture of our Website Security and PKI solutions on our earnings call last quarter, I shared with you a framework around how the financial impact of the divestiture worked.", "Now, with the transaction closed, I will update you on the impact of the divestiture to our fiscal year 2018 and Q3 guidance. Finally, with all of these elements understood, I will close and reiterate our medium term outlook.", "Let me start with an overview of our financial results for Q2. Our second quarter revenue was $1.276 billion, at about the midpoint of our prior revenue guidance range, including a slight foreign currency benefit versus our prior guidance.", "Let me give you the statistics for revenue growth in constant currency adjusted for acquisitions. Total year-over-year revenue growth was flat, at the low end of our prior guidance range. Year-over-year revenue growth was comprised of Consumer Digital Safety segment revenue growth of more than 1%, over the high end of our prior guidance range, and flat revenue in our Enterprise segment, at the low end of our prior guidance range.", "At the same time, year-over-year deferred revenue adjusted for purchase accounting, acquisitions, and divestitures was flat in our Consumer Digital Safety segment, and up 12% in our Enterprise Security segment. We look at the combination of in-quarter recognized revenue and deferred revenue as a strong indicator of the health of our business segments.", "To be clear, Q2 business results in our Enterprise segment were as planned, with sales capacity in place and delivering, but included a higher mix of ratable business. This resulted in less in-quarter recognized revenue, and more revenue deferred to the balance sheet. This has follow on impact to in quarter revenue, margins and EPS, but is a tailwind to revenue going forward.", "Operating margin for the second quarter was 34%, at the low end of our prior guidance range of 34% to 36%. Overall spending finished on track for the quarter, despite increased marketing costs in our Consumer Digital Safety segment and headwinds from M&A and divestiture related costs, which totaled approximately $20 million.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding was lower by 4 million shares at 666 million shares relative to our prior Q2 guidance of 670 million shares, partially due to less dilution from our convertible notes driven by a lower share price. Please see the dilution tables posted to our Investor Relations website where you can see the impact to diluted share count from the convertible notes at various stock prices.", "Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.40, at the low end of our prior guidance range, impacted by the mix of lower in-quarter recognized revenue versus deferred revenue in our Enterprise Security segment, and approximately $0.02 from the combination of increased marketing costs in our Consumer Digital Safety segment, and headwinds from M&A and divestiture related costs.", "Finally, cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $177 million and CapEx was $25 million.", "Now let's discuss in more detail our Q2 operating segment performance. First, Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment revenue was $701 million and grew 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As you know, our Enterprise Security segment also incorporates the financial results of the Website Security and PKI solutions we have now sold to DigiCert. We did not ultimately account for the sale as discontinued operations, so the financial results related to these solutions are included as part of the overall Enterprise segment in Q2, and incorporated on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale. We have included a set of information in the CFO commentary on our Investor Relations website to assist you in your modeling.", "Overall, Enterprise Security segment revenue growth in constant currency adjusted for acquisitions was flat year-over-year, and up 1% excluding our Website Security and PKI solutions.", "At the same time, Enterprise Security adjusted deferred revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Enterprise Business activity was strong, and in-line with our expectations; however, we experienced a greater mix of large, more ratable cross-sell transactions in the quarter. Our customers are embracing our Integrated Cyber Defense platform and are building it into their IT and security architectures for the long term. To the degree, business did not show up as in quarter recognized revenue, we expect it will show up in deferred revenue and cash flow, consistent with this quarter. And with respect to our financial model, more ratable business creates greater visibility for the long term.", "We continue to have a robust Enterprise pipeline and are confident in our visibility for fiscal 2018 second half business, which, as we have indicated previously, also incorporates the refresh of Symantec's secure web gateway franchise, ProxySG. That said, we expect to experience some continued variability between in quarter recognized revenue and deferred revenue, which we will disclose as part of earnings each quarter.", "Finally, Enterprise Security operating margin was 23%, up 11 points year-over-year, reflecting our success in continuing to take out costs while growing the business.", "Turning to Consumer Digital Safety. Our Consumer Digital Safety segment revenue was $575 million and grew 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.", "Consumer Digital Safety revenue grew more than 1% year-over-year in constant currency adjusted for acquisitions, and adjusted deferred revenue was flat. This is the second consecutive quarter of growth and above the high end of our Q2 revenue guidance of flat to plus 1% growth. Outperformance in the quarter was driven by LifeLock revenues, which grew double digits year-over-year, and continued stabilization in Norton, which declined 3% year-over-year, compared to a decline of 5% in the prior year.", "Going forward, we anticipate our customer base to be transitioning to the digital safety solution and growth rates for each product line will be less discernable. As a result, we do not plan to provide", "revenue growth split out for LifeLock and Norton in the future.", "We added a substantial number of new LifeLock members after the Equifax breach was announced in September. Since these new members joined in the last several weeks of the second quarter, we saw minimal revenue contribution from them in Q2, but expect to see the benefit in future periods.", "Moving to our Consumer metrics, which are defined in the CFO commentary. Direct customer count was 21.3 million at the end of the quarter, up 1% from Q1 o Direct ARPU increased to $8.07 per month, up 3% from Q1. If you recall, we expect these direct customer statistics to represent approximately 90% of the revenue stream at any one point in time. And, partner revenue was $61 million.", "Finally, Consumer Digital Safety operating margin was 47%, consistent with our strong Q1 margin. Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, we had $2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $6.3 billion in gross debt, including $1.75 billion of convertible notes.", "In October, we prepaid $380 million of principal on our senior term loans to further deleverage the balance sheet. And as a reminder, we have $800 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.", "Let me now pivot to talk about our cost reduction and integration synergy initiatives. I'm pleased to share that we've successfully executed ahead of schedule on the $400 million net cost reduction commitment announced in Q1 FY 2017 and the $150 million of Blue Coat integration synergies committed to at the acquisition announcement. In the Consumer segment, we've also already achieved our committed fiscal year 2018 acquisition cost synergies, and we're leveraging the combined marketing budgets of LifeLock and Norton to drive our Digital Safety strategy and reduce the cost of customer acquisition.", "As seen in our operating margins, our business is operating more efficiently than just a year ago, and we continue to drive cost efficiency and optimization actions. As we look to fiscal year 2019, we continue to expect our cash commitments related to restructuring and transition costs to decline materially from this year.", "Now, let me further discuss the sale of our Website Security and related PKI solutions to DigiCert. We successfully closed the transaction yesterday and received approximately $960 million in cash proceeds and a 27% common stock ownership interest in DigiCert after giving effect to employee equity incentives. We plan to use the transaction proceeds, net of expected taxes and expenses, primarily to repay debt. We will account for our ownership stake under the equity method of investment. Through the second quarter, the financial results from the Website Security and PKI solutions were included in our Enterprise Security segment results. For Q3, the month of October will be included in Enterprise segment results. We've provided more information regarding the historical revenues for the Website Security and PKI solutions in our supplemental materials posted on our Investor Relations website.", "As a result of closing the sale, we are now updating our prior fiscal year 2018 guidance to include the impact of the divestiture.", "Last quarter, I framed the Website Security and PKI products as contributing, on a full year basis, slightly over $400 million in revenue and $180 million in operating income. I also indicated that Symantec would continue to be burdened with stranded costs of just over $50 million per year that were previously allocated to the product lines, which will not transfer to DigiCert. There are no changes to these prior estimates.", "Moving to our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. Our fiscal year 2018 guidance initially provided in May was reconfirmed at our Q1 earnings call on a constant currency basis, but on a nominal basis, was updated for favorable foreign currency.", "Now, we are going to update our outlook for two elements: the impact of the divestiture and additional favorable foreign currency. The divestiture results in the exclusion of five months, November through March, of previously planned revenue and income of the Website Security and PKI solutions.", "The combined impact of these changes results in full year revenue guidance of $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion from our previously guided $5.16 billion to $5.26 billion, a net decrease of $160 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect this represents approximately 3% total revenue growth in constant currency adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures.", "Now I'll provide guidance for revenue adjusted for constant currency, acquisitions and divestitures for our segments. We now expect 2% to 5% Enterprise Security revenue growth compared to our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. As Greg indicated, supporting our Enterprise revenue guidance is a strong pipeline for the second half with a record number of large deal opportunities. We are adjusting our FY 2018 Enterprise Security revenue guidance range down slightly to reflect the reduction of approximately $25 million of forecasted Q2 in-quarter revenue that showed up on the balance sheet as deferred revenue.", "And we now expect 2% to 4% Consumer Digital Safety revenue growth compared to our previous guidance of 1% to 3%. Supporting our Consumer Digital Safety guidance is the subscriber, ARPU and retention improvements we have already seen through Q2, as well as member growth resulting from the Equifax breach.", "We expect operating margins for fiscal year 2018 of 35% to 36%, compared to previous guidance of 36% to 37%, primarily driven by the divestiture. Finally, we expect EPS for fiscal year 2018 of $1.66 to $1.76, compared to previous (33:46) guidance of $1.79 to $1.89. The $0.13 reduction to our prior EPS guidance is driven primarily by the divestiture, as well as M&A and divestiture related costs incurred in Q2. On our last earnings call, we indicated the divestiture would have a full-year impact of $0.20 to EPS, which had included the benefit of equity income of $0.01 to $0.02. Our revised guidance does not include the EPS impact of income from our equity interest.", "We now expect FY 2018 cash flow from operations of $800 million to $1 billion. This compares to the guidance of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion that we provided at Financial Analyst Day. This updated guidance includes the impact of restructuring, transition, and other related project costs, which we continue to expect to total approximately $500 million in FY 2018.", "Our revised cash flow guidance from operations includes the following. Approximately $100 million reduction associated with the operations of the divestiture, approximately $225 million of one-time cash taxes, fees, and expenses associated with the divestiture, and approximately $125 million of benefit from other cash items including deferred revenue.", "Moving to our third quarter outlook. Our third quarter guidance excludes the November and December plan for the now divested Website Security and PKI solutions. On a nominal basis, we expect third quarter revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion, up 4% to 6% in constant currency adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures.", "We expect revenues for our Enterprise segment to increase 5% to 8%, and for our Consumer Digital Safety segment to increase 2% to 4%, with both growth rates adjusted for constant currency and acquisitions and divestitures. We expect total company operating margins of 36% to 37%. And we expect EPS of $0.42 to $0.46, reflecting an underlying share count of approximately 674 million shares.", "Now, let me close with our medium term outlook. Looking out to fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020, we continue to be very excited about our future. We are reiterating the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. We expect total organic revenue growth for fiscal 2019 and 2020 to be in the mid-to-high single digits, with operating margins in the high 30s, and EPS growth in the low teens. This is supported by strong positions and growth potential in each of our business segments.", "We have turned the corner on what Consumer used to be at Symantec, and feel strongly that we have the strategy, the brands, the marketing dollars, and the breadth of the digital safety platform that together support Consumer Digital Safety organic revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits with operating margins over 40%.", "And on the Enterprise side, the power of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform, based on our engineering capability, our installed base presence, strong in-place sales capacity and cross and up-sell opportunity that we are already seeing take place support our Enterprise Security organic revenue growth of high single to low double digits, with operating margins in the high 20s, post the divestiture.", "Now let's transition the call to Q&A. Operator, please take it from here.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie.", "Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "All right. Thank you very much. Hey, guys. I just wanted to get into the Enterprise segment and deferred revenues a little bit, there are some divergence there, which sounds like is mix shift related, but we'd love some color on what is driving that mix shift description in in-period revenues within the business line? And then, Nick, just as a follow-up, maybe you can help me quantify that impact across some of the reported Enterprise segment results in the period?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Okay. Sarah, thanks for the question. Greg Clark here. So a couple of things that are going. First of all, we're very pleased with the amount of business that we sold in Q2. It was a big step up for us as you can see in the sequential and also, I'd like to underscore the margin increase that we drove. We are seeing an increased commitment to our Integrated Cyber Defense platform. We are seeing a bigger uptake in our subscription product. This is driven by couple of things.", "We are at a point now where the feature parity between say a virtual client and an appliance is the same. In fact there are some configurations where virtual clients even perform better than some physical appliances as there have been substantial improvements in things like VMware and the hardware underneath these platforms.", "So this is driving where we are seeing a capacity increase. We're seeing a very strong uptake of our ProxySG refresh. We are seeing a movement to subscription there. We're also seeing as we have in our DLP product, a very powerful instance of the same DLP product cloud delivered.", "This does create the shift of in-period revenue to subscriptions. We are not cutting abnormal terms. We're seeing normal terms and standard discounting, and this mix shift is driving an increase in deferred revenue. And as you can see from Nick's remarks, we are reaffirming our revenue guide and you noticed in the cash flow comments that we are increasing our fiscal 2018 cash flows. So there is a strong correlation between the deferred revenue and actually selling the right amount of business in the quarter. Nick, anything ...", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah. Sarah, let me add a couple of points for you as well. So I indicated in the script that basically $25 million of forecasted in-quarter revenue moved to deferred revenue on the Enterprise side of the fence. So we can all kind of do the math on that. And I think some of the deferred revenue statistics are pretty exciting here, and we've actually disclosed that on our CFO commentary, where we have done a full walk to really work through from GAAP deferred revenue, through purchase accounting, through Veritas, through LifeLock and through the divestiture, really what's going on at the time of deferred revenue lines.", "And that is the underpinning to my comments about Enterprise deferred revenue growth, which is, let's say, clean of Website Security and PKI. That's up 12%. We've got growth on both the short term and the long-term side of the fence, but we're really excited about that deferred revenue growth. And we look at the combination of in-quarter recognized plus deferred as really giving us a perspective on really the business conditions and the business performance in the quarter.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Also, Sarah, just at the financial Analyst Day, we added to the reporting metrics the deferred revenue because we wanted to be able to give people the ability to get a better handle on growth. Revenue plus deferred is the way to do that. We did anticipate mix shift. It's happening a little faster than we thought. And we're excited about it. It's actually a good news story.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital.", "Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Greg, maybe we'll start with you. Qualitatively if we look at the Enterprise business in the second half of this year excluding SSL, can you just walk us through the drivers for acceleration. And I've got a follow-up for Nick after that.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, definitely. I think one of the key things and we mentioned this in our comments on Financial Analyst Day. We now have a ramped sales force, and we saw that kick in, in Q2. We also have \u2013 the second half is bolstered by the Blue Coat refresh and the cross selling that goes on around that. There were some examples of that in the prepared remarks, and we really have, I think, now seen enough evidence that we can execute the cross-sell in the Integrated Cyber Defense, which really that strategy is working.", "We talked through a number of larger deals in the prepared remarks to give you some hands-on examples of that, and we have a pipeline now that is really commensurate with that ramped sales force. We're very excited about the size of it, and we still have work to do to close those transactions. As we mentioned, there are some large ones in there, but we believe we'll be successful across all that. The other thing that's happening is competitors don't have the same value proposition. And as you move to the cloud, and now you've got to get some cloud stuff to go, you've to get three or four cloud vendors to work in concert trying to deal with that SLA is really hard. So I think we've got a big leg up on the competitor.", "And if you try to hold together those point solutions, especially in the cloud era it's very difficult for the CIO to do that, it's expensive, it's fragile. And so we put all that together and we think that we've got ramped capacity, we've got the right product and we've got what we need as we look at our pipeline to deliver the growth in the second half. And that's given us a lot of confidence as you can see today reaffirming our outlook.", "Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. That's very helpful. And for my follow-up maybe for you, Nick, can you just remind us how you recognize sales commissions? We talked about the $25 million that moved to the balance sheet, but can you remind us are you amortizing those sales commissions? Or do we have a little bit of a mismatch with upfront commissions and more ratable revenue?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Those are amortized over time. So we see that and that is a policy that's been in effect at Symantec and it's something that any, in fact, any acquisition we do we move to that policy.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Joel Fishbein from BTIG.", "Joel P. Fishbein - BTIG LLC", "Good afternoon, guys. Just two quick ones, a question and a follow-up. Greg, obviously, the Integrated Cyber Defense is resonating here with the customers. Are there any areas in that you think that you're falling short or where you need to augment the Cyber Defense platform going forward? And how are you feeling about current valuations that are out there right now?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So I think we are very pleased with the portfolio that we have, both on the Enterprise Integrated Cyber Defense side and also on the Digital Safety side on Consumer, there are very strong portfolios. We have also driven a lot of integration with third parties, as well. So we do have a really strong ecosystem of other ISVs that we work with in our portfolio. But right now, I think we like the product set that we have. And to talk about valuations, I think they change all the time. We're very disciplined around M&A.", "We do small acquisitions, as you saw a few through the year that we can absolutely control our destiny and we really work out with our customers, make sure we can sell those. Those are definitely not going to upset anything in our finances. And then we also are very disciplined around doing things that are good for our equity, as we mentioned in the past. We're disciplined around M&A and we like the setup we have right now, and we're totally able to execute our plans with what we have.", "Joel P. Fishbein - BTIG LLC", "Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. You talked about the threat environment driving some adoption of proxy. Can you just tell us where you think we are with proxy refresh? And if you think the threat environment will be driving quicker adoption there?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "I think I'll answer your refresh question first. We are seeing a strong adoption of the next platform in the new set of technologies in the refresh. Those rates are consistent with the last refresh. There may be some (46:46) running around for some of our competitors that are saying that's not going well. That's going very well. And you can see in the deferred revenue build a lot of the cloud-based stuff is in the deferred revenue build and deferred revenue is larger than the whole world of many of those other competitors. And so we're doing extremely well in cloud, and that is driven by the physical form factor moving to our virtual appliances which support software defined which is what a lot of our major customers and telecom players like.", "And in addition to that, the pure cloud offering is growing very strong and we've got some great partnerships around the world on that. So we do think that that is happening and there's a very, very strong bright spot in our Cloud Access Broker, in our CASB front, that is posting some very impressive growth rates and some wins. Again, it's all ratable to cloud delivered. And the threat environment, we are seeing some pretty strong reasons in the cryptography. The Internet as reported by sort of the conservative folks, is 50% encrypted, and I've had some telecom companies telling me and say, they think it's more like 85% encrypted right now. And proxies and isolation, and there's the Fireglass acquisition, really deliver around being able to really hunt these threats down out of there and protect against that.", "So proxy demand is strong. It does not require infrastructure ownership to deploy, which means if you're using cloud and someone else is running it, you can still put proxy in. So we do see strong demand for proxy, and that part of our business is alive and well. Again, there is a delivery platform that is ratable in the refresh. And we are excited about that because we are being designed into the future networks. And so as I mentioned before, this is something that we are excited about that mix shift. It is not an issue.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse.", "Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks very much, guys. I've have got one for Greg and a follow-up for Nick. So Greg, on the Consumer business, I think it's stronger than any of us would've imagined, even just a year ago. Given that strength, would you consider spinning that business out to unlock value for shareholders and open it up to additional partnership opportunities?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So I think the Consumer business, you're right, is fixed. It is a very strong growth engine and we are seeing that even outside of the influence of the Equifax breach that definitely had some very strong tailwinds. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a number of vectors in there. They're all going well. And we are ahead on the integration. And we're ahead on that case and, as such, we're raising our outlook for that piece of the business.", "Also Financial Analyst Day, we talked about margins in the low 40s, and you can see they're coming in at the numbers that we're posting in the last couple of quarters. So I would \u2013 if we go back a year and we took a look at what the overhang was on Symantec, it was that we had double-digits and high-single digit declines in a very big piece of the cash flow.", "That is fixed. We are now forecasting strong growth rates in that business at the size of business that it is. Moving to your question as to would we spin it off, we like it right where it is. It is doing a good work. It is \u2013 we have two organizations in the business, one that focus on Enterprise, and one that focuses on Consumer, but I am extremely excited about this. And as people work from home and mobile really sets in, in the world, even more than it is now, and work in business process, we think the clean home is a clean enterprise, and we definitely see a strong correlation between what we're doing in Norton Core and a much safer enterprise network.", "And so we are excited about this, and we also have conversations in the service provider industry about what we're doing in digital safety that are very encouraging. And so I'm very happy to report that after a year, if you take a look at the Consumer business when, last August, and you take a look at it today, that is a completely different situation. And I'm proud of the company and the team and the partners that helped us really deliver to that outcome.", "Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "That's helpful color. And for Nick, just a follow-up on Joel's question, if we think about the shift to more cloud and virtual adoption for ProxySG and then we relate back to the Analyst Day expectation that you threw out for $1 billion refresh opportunity, now as the take rate, as we shift to more cloud and virtual, how should we be thinking about that? Or perhaps if you can't size it that way, just remind us when you think about the trade-off and the impact to what can be recognized in revenue to what gets deferred, how do we think that opportunity through?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "So I'd say, first of all, we laid out at our Financial Analyst Day, actually a couple of slides that showed the difference between the physical, the virtual and the cloud delivery model just in business in general, but certainly that refresh could be a perfect example for that.", "Look, we knew actually in Q4 of last year before that Financial Analyst Day, and we hit that parity point on the engineering side between those platforms as well. So as we came into this year, we expected that this was going to be the case, and as it goes though, we have to expect a little bit of variability.", "We saw a little bit of variability this quarter in business in terms of what we expected in-quarter versus deferred. We look at that go forward, we expect a little bit of variability go forward. At the end of the day, and I think we've said this in a couple of different forms, at the end of the day, we have to be able to and we want to be able to help customer in whichever delivery mechanism they want. We have built in a move towards more ratable into our forecast and into our guidance for the year as it happens. There could always be a little bit of variability, which we will give you full transparency on.", "I actually would also say around that full transparency point, if you go to that CFO commentary and you look at deferred revenue, actually taking out $300 million of WSS and PKI helps you see Enterprise all by itself. So you have full transparency as to what's going on there, and we'll show you that quarter-after-quarter including all of the pieces from GAAP to non-GAAP.", "So I hope that's helpful. But built into this year was a view that the refresh would be occurring. We talked about that for the second half. In fact, we also had indicated that front half of the year was going to be impacted by integration. We'd be ramping up the new combined sales force in the first half. We'd be ramping them up on all the new products, new relationships with the channels, et cetera, and that would be coming to pass and coming through in top line, business and bookings growth and revenue growth in the second half, and we are on that path. We feel very good about it.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you, guys, for taking the question. I'm actually going to do a one-two punch, similar to my colleague, Mr. Zelnick, there. Starting off on the Consumer side of the equation, it seemed like you guys got a really nice bounce from Equifax. Fran was out talking very bullishly about the impacts we saw, I think it was like six days after the subscriber adds that came from that breach. How should we think about kind of the curve of that impact? Obviously, it's going to be most front end loaded like when it happened, you guys try all the search terms, and we got shunted to LifeLock. But how durable is that spike going to be? Or how quickly does it peter out and become normalized? And then longer term, does LifeLock or I'm sorry, Equifax having to give away more credit monitoring for free? Does that impact you negligibly long term or is that not really an issue?", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "So, yeah, good questions, Keith. There was a ton of questions on Equifax. First of all Equifax didn't impact the Q2 revenues. It happened towards the end of the quarter, and the ratable recognition of that stuff didn't impact those results. It was de minimis in the Q2 results.", "So a couple thoughts for you, and I went into some details in the prepared remarks. Equifax was good, and it definitely increased member counts in a significant way. But what we also saw when we would offer the combined Digital Safety bundle that we've been talking about for a number of quarters to the Norton cohort when it came up for subscription or even in period work we were doing with them, we're seeing a much better uptake than we had modeled in our acquisition case of Norton folks just taking up for more money the LifeLock value proposition. You also saw if you look at the search terms that people searched for LifeLock in substantial passion when they just think about identity. So the strength of that brand is big, and we do think that there is a new normal for uptake in identity protection following Equifax, and that is more, it was very strong at the beginning but even weeks later it is sustained in a way that's different than some of the other big breaches like Anthem.", "So something else happened, which also I think drives to the power of the digital safety concept. When the KRACK vulnerability came out and everybody talked about how dangerous roaming around on Wi-Fi was, now you could have pretty much easy access to traffic on the Wi-Fi through that vulnerability. So if you were sitting in a Starbucks and some kid had some software and knew how to do it they could be siphoning off your communications. The spike in the VPN product is also very, very substantial and that product is a strong product, it's a $30 to $50 a year adder, and we're seeing that at very powerful growth rates as well. And so the Norton conversion is good, the LifeLock uptake is very good, and we're also seeing the other products in the digital safety realm really lift as well.", "And then we bring in Norton Core, and we announced Norton Core at the beginning of the year, it won some accolades. We've had it in the market as a version one. So we're careful with the introduction, and we're really starting to ramp that now. And we anticipate strong uptake there. So I think also coming back to identity protection, LifeLock does a ton more than just credit. Credit it's very good at, but it also takes care of all the other kinds of identity theft, and so the bad guys that have all those identities and many of which they already had are used for other kinds of identity crime, such as criminal drivers' licenses, people buying guns in your name, people changing the address of registered properties and then working on various things, tax returns, other things.", "And also if you have your identity stolen, which still happens all the time, the remediation and recovery of that is really delivered well from LifeLock. So we are seeing better retentions, and we are seeing more uptake but I can tell you we're confident enough now to say that we believe that adjusted for acquisition the Consumer business is going to grow sustainably and at a strong clip. And so in our guidance we're talk about mid-single digit growth rates, and we are seeing the de-risking of the business from the PC declines happening way better than we thought. And also we are within striking distance of PC unit growth. It's not far away. And put all that together, and there was a lot of negative analyst comments on Consumer rightfully so a year ago, and we're hoping that this information is changing the outlook on that. And we're really proud of what we've accomplished there, that's one of the better turnarounds in my knowledge base.", "Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. That's super helpful. And, Nick, just on the full year 2018 guidance, I want to make sure I fully understand the bridge from the guidance prior to the \u2013 or the guidance coming out of last quarter to guidance coming out of this quarter. So there's the puts and takes. You impacted for like $25 million in revenue that got put on to the balance sheet this quarter. The divestiture taken out of the guidance and you sort of added back some incremental benefit from FX. Is there any \u2013 have you kind of adjusted your expectations about ratable versus getting license upfront in the back half as well? Meaning do you now have like an assumption for more ratable revenue coming from the Blue Coat side of the equation into the back half as well?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Well, we had more ratable coming into the entirety of the year. So in terms of the first half/second half, I think that we have $25 million in Q2 that showed up as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. We have strong business activity and business activity on track to plan and guidance. So as we go into the second half, we have a very, very strong pipeline. We feel very good about it.", "In terms of that ratable recognition, there's a significant amount of ratable business already happening here. We know that that can be a little bit variable or on the edges. So we have to be conscious of that. We've tried to guide appropriately for those types of things in the second half of the year. And in terms of the Website Security business, and the Website Security and PKI solutions, in that second half guide, there's really no difference versus what we had talked about before on a full-year basis. But you just have to remember that we're taking it out for the month of November through March. So in terms of walking prior guidance to current guidance, it is pretty basic in terms of just the two pieces, the divestiture and a little bit of FX rolling through there.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "I think Nick makes a good comment. Looking at the second half, it's a big ramp in the second half. We understand that. We've got a pipe to support it. We've got capacity to support it. We have to execute the closure of that pipe. We feel good about our ability to do that. We do have a good mix of transactions in there. Some are very large because the Integrated Digital Safety platform is working which is driving deal size up. There may be some timing in there, but we are definitely confident about the outlook, and especially the long-term outlook for what we're up to.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey guys. Two quick ones if I can squeeze in. First of all, Greg, you talked a lot about SEP 14 and ATP and the new versions there. So what if any the impact that we see on renewal rates and/or ASPs, and I have a second question.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Yeah, it's a very good question. So first of all, I'd like to just remind everybody that we said we were, and I think predictability is extremely important in what we're doing. And a year ago, we said we were going to come after these gaps in our unified converged endpoint around EDR. And some of these other things we actually innovated some more there and delivered a deception blade in there as well. But we have completed with SEP 14.1 a very solid piece of work around EDR and flight recorders. We believe we have now reached feature parity with the point solutions that did that and we have one major footprint with that. We have 7 million odd deployments now of the EDR capability. So it is being battle hardened, and we believe that that is a huge footprint, and if you look at some of the folks that just specialize in that, I think we are going past their installed bases already. So we do think that we have a very strong upsell capability around those value propositions that are delivered in SEP 14.1.", "SEP 14 also has been doing extremely well. And as we mentioned, we got a really good conversion rate in SEP 14 in our installed base. And we do see strong improvement in what was less than acceptable renewal rates in prior periods before SEP 14 for the SEP agent. We've absolutely turned that around, and I think we are leading even in these advanced zero-day malwares, our AI detected WannaCry, stopped it, no signatures. So we've got the proof that that's working and we continue to innovate that. And I think it's just a testament to the capacity and engineering that we have behind that problem.", "We shut that gap down in 12 months with quality product. And again, I'm really proud of that team. I think they're really distinguishing themselves in the industry, and that set of threat researches that comes with them is differentiated. So I think we're going to do very well in Endpoint. As the Internet goes dark, Endpoint is going to become extremely, extremely important. And Mobile Endpoint is where the future lives. And we're one of the only large vendors that's vending with our own technology, a full suite across Windows, Apple products, including Mac and iOS and Android. And so I think we're very well set up on the Endpoint. This is a space we're super serious about and we've got a lot of talent on it. And we're going to be there for the long haul.", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. Greg, my follow-up was I think for Nick. If I try to adjust for next quarter for pulling out two months and then pulling out (1:06:09) for five months on the full-year, it seems like you still even adjusting for that, you still came in below for third quarter but you're pretty close on the full year. So it seems as if it's more of a fourth quarter versus third quarter skew. Is my math right? And if so, why do we get this skew?", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "In terms of the overall business, say on Enterprise, or what specific things you're talking about there, Michael?", "Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. Total numbers on revenue. A little bit...", "Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp.", "Total numbers on revenue? Yeah. So, first of all, you do have to adjust for that Website Security and PKI in Q3. So we're talking about taking out and leaving in one month, basically. The overall revenues for the back half are pretty much what we expected them to be for that side of the business. So there's really not much difference there in the terms of build-up versus our original view of the year. Obviously, we never gave like specific Q2, Q3 type of ramp. But as we look at the revenue stream for the second half, we're very satisfied and feel very strong in our position there.", "As you may have seen, we tweaked a bit the Enterprise down basically by the Consumer. I'm sorry, by the second quarter $25 million Consumer up, basically the same amount inside of that overall revenue guidance for the year. That's pretty much all we've done to it. So we feel on track for what we're planning to do. We feel like we've got the pipeline on the Enterprise side, the position, as Greg indicated, the sales capacity in place. And then, obviously, the consumer metrics as well supporting that side of the fence. So we feel quite good about it.", "Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp.", "Okay.", "Operator", "And at this time I'm showing that we are at time. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?", "Nate Pollack - Symantec Corp.", "I'd just like to thank everybody for joining our calls and thanks for your support. And I look forward to next time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time and so we may get to everyone's question, we ask that you please limit yourself to one main question and one follow-up question.", "Thank you. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Cynthia Hiponia. Ma'am?", "Cynthia Hiponia", "Good afternoon. This is Cynthia Hiponia, Vice President of Investor Relations at Symantec and I am pleased to welcome you to our call to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings results. We have posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations events webpage. Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec's CEO and Nick Noviello, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website.", "I would like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations website for further definitions of our non-GAAP metrics.", "Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measure in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website.

Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information.", "You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.", "And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark.", "Greg Clark", "Thank you for joining us and good afternoon. We are disappointed that we missed our total company revenue guidance for Q3 despite what we feel was an otherwise good quarter for our business. Our Consumer Digital Safety segment achieved the high-end of our revenue guidance for the quarter. Our Enterprise segment, on the other hand, recognized less revenue than we forecast, despite selling and invoicing more business than we planned. This was due to an increasing mix shift towards our ratable, subscription and cloud-delivered products that reduced in-period revenue recognition. Most of my prepared remarks will focus on our Enterprise segment.", "As we have discussed on prior calls, to grow our Enterprise business, since the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat, we have focused on building our Enterprise sales force team, who in turn create the pipeline to grow the business. We had the right level of capacity and selling activity from our Enterprise sales force in Q3, but we did not correctly forecast the perpetual product and license versus ratable mix, which resulted in lower in-period revenue and a larger increase in our deferred revenue balance.", "Our customers are purchasing our ratable products much more frequently than we anticipated in our plans in FY 2018. We now expect this ratable, mix shift trend to continue to a point where traditional license and appliance product sales become the exception in our business. As our cloud and subscription solutions have reached parity with our traditional appliance products, our customers are adopting our ratable solution at an increasing pace due to their evolving buying preference for cloud and subscription form factors and differentiation from our solutions. Our Enterprise strategy always embraced this shift in both our selling motion and our product roadmaps, but the pace of this transition has far exceeded our expectations.", "We are winning the volume of business that we expected, as is represented by our implied billings growth, which is up 27% year-over-year for Enterprise in the third quarter, as adjusted for the divestiture of our Certificate Authority business. However, the shift towards a ratable revenue mix is a significant trend for us and will continue. As a result, we are reducing our Q4 and FY 2018 Enterprise revenue guidance to incorporate a higher ratable mix for our Enterprise business going forward and we will be providing expectations for implied billings in Q4.", "Ultimately, this change in our enterprise revenue model results in a greater visibility and more predictable cash flow generation. You can see strength in Q3 implied billings growth, deferred revenue and cash flow. We believe these become increasingly important financial metrics for us as we are now a more ratable business.", "For Q3, even with our Enterprise revenue shortfall, we performed well against other financial metrics. Operating margin exceeded our guidance as we realized continued cost efficiencies. EPS benefited from those cost efficiencies as well as from U.S. tax reform and we generated strong cash flow from operations, which should benefit going forward from our strong business momentum, deferred revenue and the drop off in costs associated with our restructuring initiatives.", "Turning to the market and how we are doing with customers. Our cross-selling strategy is working. Symantec is increasingly closing larger deals with multi-product platform sales. Enterprise customers are designing us into their security architectures by adopting our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. They are choosing our platform because it offers superior protection, cross-product integration and a lower overall cost-of-ownership. In particular, the proxy refresh opportunity in our installed base has allowed customers to bring us into their next-generation architecture, securing their adoption of cloud and cloud applications.", "In doing so, customers are increasingly choosing our cloud and virtual appliance proxies over our traditional appliance form factor. The integration of our network and endpoint products has been an enabler for our cross-sell strategy as customers look to leverage the integrations between our Enterprise products to consolidate vendors and enhance security posture.", "Increased adoption of our cloud proxy also makes it easier and more cost effective for the customers to deploy additional security from Symantec, such as multi-factor authentication, email protection, protection for cloud applications as well as data loss prevention, without requiring the customer to deploy appliances.", "This success is validating the long-term growth prospects for Symantec in our vast installed base. In our large Enterprise base, our new bookings are typically sold with a three-year license term that are billed up-front to customers, similar to many of our other peers in other Enterprise sector. For our large Enterprise renewals business, we follow industry-standard practices with respect to discounting and contract terms, with firm policy and practice around extensions.", "Since the beginning of fiscal 2018, when we realigned our sales force and simplified our Enterprise business, we have seen the number of deals over $1 million grow from 37 in the first quarter, to 47 in the second quarter, to more than 100 in the third quarter, a substantial increase from a year ago. We displaced competitors in the majority of these opportunities last quarter.", "A customer example of this: In the third quarter, one of the world's largest construction companies, a long-time Symantec and Blue Coat customer, chose our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform based on our ability to combine existing solutions to extend the security to their cloud infrastructure. Where we were previously securing all of their endpoint, DLP and network infrastructure, we refreshed their existing installed base for an additional three years and extended our presence with Symantec Endpoint Protection 14.1, DLP, PGP and Proxy.", "We won on our ability to integrate our solutions across the entire portfolio. This deal would not have been possible before the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat and a great majority of this transaction is ratable business. There are many more examples of our success in selling our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform within our Q3 cohort of deals over $1 million. The strength of our Endpoint Protection solution is one area where our competitive advantages continue to widen. Endpoint has become a growth driver in enabling us to bring customers additional capabilities through our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform.", "I am pleased to announce that last week, Symantec has also once again been positioned in the Leaders quadrant of the January 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms which we believe is further validation of our continued leadership in Endpoint. Symantec is positioned the furthest among all other vendors in the Leaders quadrant on both execution and vision. I encourage you to take a look at the new vendor positioning in this Magic Quadrant, which we believe illustrates how the market and key criteria for these endpoint products is evolving.", "To bring that leadership to another customer example: In the third quarter, a global Fortune 500 financial services company chose our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, with endpoint being the primary driver of this deal. In this transaction, Symantec displaced nine vendors across 22 product areas. And in addition to selecting our platform over several different point solutions, in many product areas the customer chose the cloud form factor of our solution.", "Another customer example of the vendor consolidation and ratable product adoption we are seeing involved one of the world's largest Fintech companies. They chose Symantec to consolidate their security vendor landscape, while gaining a stronger overall security posture. This customer eliminated eight other security vendors across multiple product areas, reducing the risk, integration and sustainment expenses required to stitch together a portfolio of point solutions and realized new integrations across their security architecture. The customer concluded this would improve their security posture and increase their productivity. Where previously this customer had deployed two of our solutions, with our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, the customer is now using nine solutions from Symantec, five of which are cloud solutions.", "Now let me now turn to our Consumer Digital Safety business, which had a strong quarter. Recall that only eighteen months ago this business was in decline, with decreasing retention rates and ARPU. Today, our Consumer Digital Safety business has been transformed. Revenue in the third quarter was at the high-end of our guidance range, with an organic growth rate of 4% year-over-year in constant currency. We experienced 53% operating margins and an increased ARPU.", "In summary, we are pleased with the volume of business across our Enterprise and Consumer segments, with continued strong adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform in our Enterprise business and the solid performance of our Consumer Digital Safety business. We recognize that we underestimated the timing of the shift in our Enterprise business towards a higher ratable revenue mix and have reflected this change in our guidance.", "Nick will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our outlook. Nick?", "Nick Noviello", "Thank you Greg and good afternoon everyone. I would like to remind you that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. Please note we have posted information on implied billings and deferred revenue, as well as other tables in our supplemental materials and CFO commentary to our Investor Relations website.", "As Greg discussed in his comments, we acknowledge that we did not anticipate the speed at which the mix of our ratable versus product business in Enterprise would shift. In light of this, we have now built into our Q4 and fiscal year 2018 outlook the impact of an ongoing and accelerated shift to ratable business in our Enterprise segment and its impact to in-period revenue. We will now be reporting implied billings quarterly, in addition to deferred revenue, which provides additional visibility into the growth of the Enterprise business as it becomes more ratable.", "Let me now review our financial results for Q3 in more detail. Our third quarter revenue was $1.234 billion. This was comprised of Consumer Digital Safety revenue at the high-end of our prior revenue guidance range and Enterprise Security revenue below the low-end of our prior revenue guidance range.", "Looking at organic revenue growth in constant currency, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures: Total company year-over-year revenue growth was 2%. Year-over-year revenue growth was comprised of Consumer Digital Safety segment revenue growth of 4% and an Enterprise Security segment decline of 1%. At the same time, year-over-year deferred revenue, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, was up 5% in our Consumer Digital Safety segment and up 23% in our Enterprise Security segment. As we indicated last quarter, we look at the combination of in-quarter recognized revenue and deferred revenue as a strong indicator of the health of our business segments.", "Third quarter revenue came in lower than expected primarily due to the mix of product and ratable business in our Enterprise segment. As we discussed a quarter ago, our pipeline of business coming into Q3 was significantly larger than our prior forecasts and was made up of increasingly large, cross-sell opportunities. The trend towards ratable business we saw in the second quarter was built into our Q3 guidance. However, that trend accelerated in the third quarter, faster than we forecasted. Ultimately, the transactions we closed, some of which Greg referenced, are proof our Enterprise strategy is working. You can see the strength of our business in implied billings growth, deferred revenue and cash flow.", "Operating margin for the third quarter was 38%, above the high-end of our prior guidance range of 36% to 37%. The higher operating margin was the result of continued cost and operating efficiencies, including the completion of the net cost reduction and synergy programs we discussed last quarter, across the business.", "Now turning to tax. As a result of recent tax reform, we reduced our estimated effective tax rate from 29.5% to 26.8% for fiscal 2018 and in Q3, trued up our year-to-date effective tax rate accordingly. This resulted in a Q3 rate of approximately 22.5%. On a GAAP basis, our tax provision for Q3 includes a provisional benefit of approximately $1.6 billion from adjustments to previous deferred tax liabilities related to foreign earnings and re-measurement of U.S. deferred income taxes. This was partially offset by a liability of approximately $800 million for the one-time transition tax.", "Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.49, $0.03 above the high-end of our prior guidance range, impacted by higher operating margins and a favorable impact of just over $0.04 from the effective tax rate true-up. Excluding the in-quarter tax rate benefit, we achieved EPS near the high-end of our guidance range, enabled by effective cost management across the business.", "Fully diluted shares outstanding was lower by seven million shares at 667 million as compared to our prior Q3 guidance of 674 million, primarily due to less dilution from our convertible notes driven by our lower share price. Please see the dilution tables posted to our Investor Relations website where you can see the impact to diluted share count from the convertible notes at various stock prices.", "Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $294 million and CapEx was $33 million. During the quarter, we prepaid $630 million of principal on our senior term loans. We have reduced our gross debt from approximately $8.3 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year to $5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. $1.75 billion of this balance is convertible notes.", "At the end of the third quarter, we had $2.5 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. $1.6 billion of that was held by our foreign subsidiaries, just over $1 billion of which we have identified as available for repatriation in the near term. As a result of tax reform, we would not expect to incur additional U.S. tax liability on that repatriation. We are considering our go-forward capital allocation strategy in light of tax reform and expect to update you on our next quarter's earnings conference call. As a reminder, we have $800 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.", "Now let's discuss in more detail our Q3 operating segment performance. First, Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment revenue was $639 million, reflecting an organic decline of 1% year-over-year in constant currency. As you know, we completed the sale of the WSS and PKI solutions to DigiCert at the end of October. Financial results related to these solutions for the month of October were as expected and are included as part of the overall Enterprise Security segment in Q3.", "Adjusted deferred revenue was up $316 million or 23% year-over-year, $88 million of which is short term and $228 million of which is long term. Implied billings was up 27% year-over-year, excluding any impact from divestitures. Please note, consistent with our disclosure around deferred revenue, we are now providing seven quarters of implied billings historical data in the Q3 Supplemental Information posted to our IR website.", "We believe implied billings growth is an important measure of the growth of our Enterprise business as we transition to a more ratable product mix. After taking into account the shift to more ratable business and increased contract duration for new business consistent with our cross-sell strategy, we believe our implied billings growth supports high single-digit to low double-digit Enterprise revenue growth over time.", "And as you will hear in my guidance comments, we are anticipating continued double-digit implied billings growth in the fourth quarter. Finally, Enterprise Security segment operating margin was 23%, up over six points year-over-year, as we continue to optimize the cost structure of the business.", "Turning to Consumer Digital Safety. Our Consumer Digital Safety segment revenue was $595 million and reflected organic growth of 4% year-over-year in constant currency.", "Moving to our Consumer metrics, which are defined in the CFO commentary: Direct customer count was 21.3 million at the end of the quarter, up slightly from Q2. Direct ARPU increased to $8.38 per month, up 4% from Q2. If you recall, we expect these direct customer statistics to represent approximately 90% of the revenue stream at any one point in time.", "Consumer Digital Safety operating margin was 53%. Sequentially this is a five point increase in operating margin and is in part related to marketing spending we pulled ahead into Q2, timing of investments and other efficiencies.", "Moving to our fourth quarter outlook. As I indicated, we are building the accelerating ratable mix shift in our Enterprise segment into our outlook and are lowering our guidance to reflect this transition. We now expect fourth quarter revenue guidance of $1.175 billion to $1.205 billion. This represents an organic growth rate of 1.5% year-over-year at the mid-point in constant currency.", "Enterprise revenue of $575 million to $595 million, down 4% year-over-year in organic revenue in constant currency at the mid-point due to the ratable shift in business mix. This is down sequentially from Q3 due to the WSS/PKI divestiture, which contributed over $30 million to segment revenue in Q3, as well as increased ratable business mix. As Greg indicated, our pipeline and expectations for business we will close in Q4 are higher than in Q3, but we are forecasting a higher ratable mix of business as well.", "Ultimately, we expect, excluding any impact from divestitures, double-digit implied billings growth year-over-year in Q4, evidencing the growth of our business and supporting our medium-term growth outlook. Consumer Digital Safety revenue of $600 million to $610 million, representing an organic growth rate in constant currency of 6% year-over-year at the mid-point, Consolidated operating margins of 33% to 34%, an effective tax rate of 26.8% and EPS of $0.37 to $0.41 on an underlying share count of 680 million fully diluted shares.", "Now moving to our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. We now expect full year revenue guidance of $4.915 billion to $4.945 billion, down from our previously guided $5 billion to $5.1 billion, reflecting the transition in our Enterprise Security segment. Enterprise revenue of $2.585 billion to $2.605 billion. This represents a decline of 2% in the organic growth rate in constant currency at the mid-point. Consumer Digital Safety revenue of $2.330 billion to $2.340 billion, representing an organic growth rate in constant currency of roughly 3% year over year.", "Consolidated operating margins for fiscal year 2018 of approximately 34% compared to previous guidance of 35% to 36%. EPS for fiscal year 2018 of $1.60 to $1.64, compared to previous guidance of $1.66 to $1.76. Fully diluted shares of 669 million. And fiscal year 2018 cash flow from operations around the high-end of our previous guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion.", "Let me address our outlook for fiscal year 2019 and 2020. We believe that in fiscal year 2019 our financial model will be in transition as we evolve to a company with a higher mix of ratable revenue in our Enterprise Security segment. We continue to expect that our Consumer Digital Safety segment will grow organically in the low to mid single digits in fiscal year 2019.", "We expect that as we exit fiscal year 2019, our Enterprise Security segment revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digits with high visibility and growing from there. During this model transition, implied billings growth will be an important measure of the trajectory of our Enterprise Security segment. And during the transition, expect disciplined management of costs and investments across the business and strong cash flow.", "Our medium-term outlook, beyond fiscal year 2019, is intact, with mid to high single-digit revenue growth and EPS growth in the low teens. We continue to expect Consumer Digital Safety organic revenue growth in the low to mid single digits and Enterprise Security segment organic revenue growth in the high single to low double digits.", "We expect our effective tax rate will benefit from the tax reform bill and are currently estimating a rate in the 21% to 22% range. We expect to further hone our effective tax rate estimate over the next few months and we will consider reinvesting part of the savings from a lower effective tax rate as early as fiscal year 2019. We will provide our full financial outlook and specific guidance for fiscal 2019 on our fourth quarter earnings call.", "Let me now turn the call back over to Greg for some closing remarks.", "Greg Clark", "Thank you Nick. I am told I am a pretty optimistic person. In spite of our third quarter revenue miss, I have never been more excited about the opportunity ahead of Symantec. Our strategy, technology and value propositions are resonating with customers and we are executing well on our growth drivers. We are largely a service-delivered software company now. We are winning in the marketplace as customers design us into their future security architecture. We are disappointed that we did not accurately forecast the speed of the ratable mix shift in our Enterprise segment, but this transition is a long-term benefit for our business and we have good reasons for optimism about our future growth prospects.", "In Enterprise, our pipeline of business continues to grow. As we head into fiscal 2019, we expect to deploy even more sales capacity into the field. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is resonating with customers who don't want to stitch together a portfolio of point solutions and our cloud solutions are leading the way. Our Enterprise business remains healthy with implied billing growth up 27% and deferred revenue up 23% year-over-year in the third quarter, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our Enterprise growth strategy is intact driven by the TAM we operate in, the cross-sell and upsell opportunity we have by nature of our large installed base and the sales capacity we have in the field. These drivers are expected to provide momentum to continue to support our medium-term Enterprise revenue growth outlook. Our Consumer Digital Safety has transformed into a growing business with future growth opportunities in cross-selling and international expansion.", "We have now set guidance at levels that reflect the Enterprise segment financial model transition, which will provide us with higher revenue visibility going forward and this entire management team and Symantec employees are focused on delivering the growth potential we have worked so hard to create.", "With that, Nick and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse.", "Brad Zelnick", "Thank you very much and good afternoon guys. Greg, it's great to hear the platform strategy is working and those customer examples you have shared and I appreciate you are selling a lot more product that's cloud and virtual. Where do we stand today against the $1 billion proxy refresh opportunity? And how much of it is left as we look out into next year?", "GregClark", "Yes. Hi Brad. Thanks for the question. So what we are seeing in that proxy refresh, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that we are getting a lot of that business coming in a cloud form factor, people buying that cloud version of our proxy. And in addition to that, we are seeing a strong uptick of our proxy customers really going after protecting the cloud applications with our CASB and the cloud form factor on top of the proxy stack.", "What that means is, we are hitting the right number of dollars in that refresh but it's coming in the cloud delivered form factor and also in a software defined networking element which is our virtual appliance, the ProxySG. So customers are picking those choices more than they used to which means we are selling less appliances, but we are in a good place with the proxy refresh and we believe that our conversion rates in the proxy refresh are strong like they were last time and our customers that purchase that from us are very happy that we have extended the value proposition of the on-premise story from four years ago to the cloud generation.", "And so to answer your question, we believe that proxy refresh is in good shape. But the mix has shifted to ratable form factor.", "Brad Zelnick", "Very helpful Greg. And just one for Nick. Nick, I am already being asked this. Just it's difficult for us to reconcile the strong enterprise billings growth with your revenue outlook. Can you give us a sense of duration on these subscription deals and how billings duration compares year-over-year or perhaps an annualized look at the business, which is how I imagine you are looking at it internally?", "Nick Noviello", "Sure. And Brad, thanks for the question when we are doing all of that work. So expect first of all, we are giving you the set of implied billings numbers. It's important for you to understand this is the first quarter of being able to give you a set of data here on Enterprise that allows comparability period-to-period.", "In terms of the overall number of 27%, that obviously in going to have in it a radical shift and it's also going to have in it some contract duration side as we cross-sell and bring these things together. You can expect to hear more from us about both of those items and more from us about how contract duration is changing period-to-period.", "Suffice to say, overall, we have done a good amount of work internally. We believe that overall we are supporting the overall growth rate of Enterprise that we expect over time, which is a high single, low double-digit timeframe. So more to come on that topic. Over time, we will obviously give you much more on our Q4 earnings call and into next year, but we put out a set of numbers that you can understand what implied billings are comprised of, how we calculated it and we will give more to you go-forward.", "GregClark", "And just to add one piece of that, Brad. We know that you need contract length. We are going to give more for you in Q4 on that. But we do have very strict adherence to standard terms for new business around contract length and also for renewal business around contract length. We also have aligned our sales commission plans with these terms. So we have incentives to keep that in the right place and we are doing work on these topics and expect to have more commentary for you following the Q4 actuals as we move into 2019.", "I think it's important to note that Q3 marks the second quarter of us selling our Integrated Cyber Defense package which is the integration between a lot of the Symantec elements and Blue Coat elements. So we have a couple of quarters of actuals that we are happy with how our sales force has been behaving against that standard terms.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital.", "Saket Kalia", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. First maybe for you, Greg. I think most of us get the increase in mix of subscription and the impact to rev rec. But just to make sure we address the headline lowering on Enterprise revenue, can you comment at all on whether you saw a change in win rates in any part of the Enterprise business?", "GregClark", "I think there is a lot of products in our Enterprise business and I think it's important just to focus on couple of those elements. We are seeing a really strong uptake in the initial release of our EDR capabilities and what we call SEP 14.1. That is the SEP 14.1 with our ATP package, that is going well in our endpoint install base. And we are also seeing a very strong uptake of the DLP attachment to our CloudStack which is very, very good business for us. We have a big DLP installed base and that is very strong market force that's happening, especially in the limelight of compliance issues in GDPR.", "Outside of that, I think we are selling an Integrated Cyber Defense package. It is a bundle of components. And I tried to talk about in the examples in my prepared remarks that when we do go in and sell a set of those products that we are seeing a larger proportion of the ratable form factor of those. A comment on that, I think is helpful in terms of understanding what's doing well.", "When we offer a customer an appliance form factor or a very powerful virtual appliance form factor, we are seeing more propensity to purchase the more flexible deployment model that you get from the software defined side. And in addition to that, because we have such a good growth in the cloud area, we are seeing things like our cloud DLP carrying good work. So it's more mix shift and we are very happy with the total level of selling volume in Q3. We sold what we thought we were going to sell and probably the major product lines that our growth prospects were on fed well in that.", "And as you can see, it's hard on the conference call to talk about each separate product line, because there are quite a few very elaborate set of elements to our Integrated Cyber Defense. Hopefully that's helpful.", "Saket Kalia", "Yes. Absolutely. Maybe from a follow-up, maybe for you, Nick. First of all, thank you for the billings numbers in Enterprise. Can you talk about what percentage of those billings are now coming in ratably versus historical? And then also looking forward, where did that mix could sort of top out?", "Nick Noviello", "Sure. Good question. So I think, first of all, thinking about Q3, okay. When we came into Q3, we planned a set of business. We talked about a set of business that was moving more ratable in Q2. And we looked at pipeline. We applied that ratable by the end of Q2 into our guidance for Q3. Just for context, the ratable mix of business moved five point between our forecast for Q3 and the end result, okay. So that's a good size chunk. Our ratable business is now over 80%. So that's on the bookings billing side as it comes in. So think about that as over 80%. So it's substantial.", "But we also built into Q4, we built not only that but an increasing ratable mix into our overall revenue guide. So we are trying to be thoughtful about this not only in terms of the acceleration from Q2 through to Q3, but also being conscious that this is a selling motion and as Greg indicated this is working out very well with customers and we are going to move in this direction.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie.", "Sarah Hindlian", "All right. Great. Thank you very much. A couple of questions for you guys. I would love to hear about how the DigiCert's JV is progressing? What's going on over there? And how you are thinking about that going forward to start with? And then I have a couple other follow-ups as well.", "Nick Noviello", "Okay. Hi Sarah. So let me start with the DigiCert side of the fence and I am sure Greg might add some comments to this as well. So we obviously closed the transaction in the quarter. You will see in the math here that we have about $35 million of revenue inside the Enterprise segment from the business before it transitioned across. We are in the servicing of TSA world now. We are in the area where TSAs are starting to come off. We have got more planned over time. So going well operationally.", "Obviously, they are working on the business on their front as well. And Greg maybe has some comments on that. We do not have built into this guidance anything in terms of the equity interest. We are new in the industry. We don't have any numbers yet. So it's impossible to build it in. We would be watching that and then as we exit the fiscal year, we will give you a perspective on how we are going to build the equity interest into the numbers and what you should be thinking about.", "GregClark", "And I think, Sarah, the transition from an operations point of view of the team and the infrastructure and stuff over to DigiCert and then getting going into the market, that's in great hands over there. They are excellent as to what they do and the cornerstone of the Symantec team is there and they are continuing to meet their deliverables. We are a customer of it and we have seen nothing wrong. So we think that's going well in the market. The 900 pound gorilla of stricter authorities now and I think they have a good future ahead.", "Sarah Hindlian", "Okay. Thank you Greg. And just one to more follow-up with you on, we have got a couple of quarters of LifeLock under the belt now and you obviously have some benefits from the Equifax data breach. But I would love to hear about how the go-to-market is going? And what customer retention and reception is around the bundled identity and endpoint protection suite together?", "GregClark", "Yes. I think I would say, I would praise internal team on the LifeLock/Norton integration work. That has going extremely well. And we did have a very good quarter, as you can see in our results. And I think we are expecting to see another great result in Q4. But just in general, that package is extremely valued by the consumer community. We saw, as reported in our remarks, a slight increase in subscribers and if you go back 18 months ago and have a look at what was happening in the business at that point in time, that was different. And we are seeing really promising conversion rates at renewal, between when we present the bundled offering to either side of the cohort whether it be the LifeLock side or the Norton side. So we do think that we are going to see a stable business there going forward.", "Sarah Hindlian", "Okay. Great. Thank you both very much.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.", "Melissa Franchi", "Hi. Thanks. This is Melissa Franchi, calling in for Keith. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into, again, the transition to ratable. I am just trying to understand what's driving the meaningful inflection over the past few quarters to ratable? Is it largely customer preference? Or are you doing anything internally to either inciting your sales force or the customer base to move to more subscriptions? And then the follow-up to that is just over what time period do you think this transition will be fully complete?", "GregClark", "Okay. So thanks for the question, Melissa. And let me start up on the first part. So what we are offering when we go into a customer is, don't think of it as we are showing up with a bunch of Blue Coat products and then a bunch of Symantec products. We are showing up with an integrated product suite. So we have really done the work to integrate the important elements of our proxy stack with the key pieces of the Symantec portfolio.", "And to give you an example, if we want to take care of the PII compliance in cloud applications for Enterprise customers, which is a very strong market right now. We come to the customer with an offering that says you can put that in on-premise proxies. Or you we can put that in our cloud proxies. And it's integrated with the DLP. We have a cloud DLP module and you can get it integrated with our multifactor authenticator which is our VIP product.", "And when we show up with those things integrated and ready to go, what were seeing is, our customers are picking the cloud form factor of that and the virtual appliance form factor that way more often than we thought they were going to. We thought we might see in some that even in the more regulated industries we are seeing the cloud adoption faster than we thought. And when we looked at what's in the bill of materials in the pipelines and we see the big elements of that in there, that is what is getting us to advise the community that we see this as a long-term trend and we are taking down that we are increasing the ratable software percentage in the business in their long-term models to accommodate for that.", "But it really is customer choice and the fact that we have integrated product sets together in a way that is very compelling. And when you see that, you don't have to buy an appliance and deploy it and you don't have to go and do a bunch of work and you turn it on just like you do it at software delivered as a service, it is winning in the market. And that is where we think is long-term trend value proposition strong and we think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are a service delivered software company.", "Nick Noviello", "And so Melissa maybe -- yes, sorry, go ahead.", "Melissa Franchi", "No, no. You go ahead.", "Nick Noviello", "I was going to indicate that, so in my prepared remarks, we talked about the transition. So we are in the transition and you might have heard a few minutes ago I indicated that our percentage or proportion of ratable businesses is up over 80% as we plan for this and we gave a guidance for this fourth quarter. Obviously as we then think about the revenue side of the fence, we roll through a period of time where we are transitioning off of a product sale in quarter that has heavy in-quarter revenue contribution to that ratable business. And we think that is the transition that is through fiscal 2019 and I talked about in the prepared remarks that we really think we will see the revenue growth side of that in the back or as we exit fiscal year 2019, back to that mid to high. And that supports going from there the high single to low double topline of the Enterprise that we look at on our medium term as in a FY 2020 type of forecast.", "Melissa Franchi", "Okay.", "GregClark", "Melissa, when we get to the fourth quarter announcement, we will print another quarter and we will be able to give you some really good indications of how we think that's going to go.", "Melissa Franchi", "Okay. Great. Just one quick follow-up for Nick. As I just to revisit the guidance at the Analyst Day for operating margins, I think you guided to over 30% operating margins in the Enterprise business in FY 2019, FY 2020. Does that still hold true just given the increased mix to ratable or any other factors?", "Nick Noviello", "So that's a good question. And one of the things that we have to be thoughtful about is obviously the transition and what does that mean in terms of topline revenue. And regardless of the very good cost management we have in place here, our topline revenue that is impacted by in-quarter versus ratable is going to have some implications to operating margin.", "The other thing to think about and the other thing that we are being thoughtful about is the implications of tax reform. And in my prepared remarks, I indicated that we have a substantial reduction in our ETR to we are estimating right now in the 21%, 22% range. So we need to look at that as well in terms of potential for reinvestment in certain areas of the business as we go.", "The final thing I would probably have you just keep in mind is that, back at Financial Analyst Day, we had, let's say, security and PKI in the numbers. So we had updated that Enterprise operating margin perspective between then and now. But suffice to say there is a couple of things to keep in mind there if I net it all out, you should keep in mind overall we have done a lot of work here on cost side in terms of cost optimization. We have achieved all of our targets on the cost side of the fence. That is part of the perspective that Greg bring into the firm. So you should expect that we are very focused on that. However, we will look at the tax reform as one opportunity to look at some of that for reinvestment as others certainly are talking about.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.", "Gabriela Borges", "Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is for Nick. I wanted to revisit the pricing scenarios that you put forth at the Analyst Day where we looked at the appliance dollars with maintenance and we looked at the subscription model dollars over time. Could you just remind us when do you breakeven versus the old model of selling on the subscription side? And are there scenarios where the virtual form factors are expanding these cases that you can address at existing customers or perhaps moving down market at all?", "Nick Noviello", "Yes. So good question. So in that Financial Analyst Day, we were talking about up to a four year type of breakeven term. And we are looking at those form factors at the time knowing that in Q4, we had announced that we had completed the technological side of the fence as equaling the capability, whether it be VA or cloud or physical. I would say and one of the things that Greg talked about in his prepared remarks, is that the opportunity with the integration of products has really created a nice cross-sell on motion here and that is certainly one of the reasons in one of the areas that's accelerating this move towards ratable.", "GregClark", "I think to answer your down market question on some of the new offerings we have, we did some announcements in the quarter that, I think, are really powerful. We announced a product in AWS. We announce a product in Azure. We announced a product in the Google Cloud. And we also have a SEP cloud product which is being represented by Tier 1 telecom companies that was also announced. That is bringing very powerful technology to a midmarket and even small market where you can get the power of the Symantec Endpoint Protection for cloud managed and that is a route that is definitely enhanced by some of those new products.", "Over time, we do hope to rebuild our prior dominance in the small because we have some very, very strong product there. And some of our competitors didn't fare well in the malware crisis amongst those kind of companies that really don't have an IT staff. We also have made good progress with some of the managed security service providers. We announced a very good deal with Airtel in India bringing that product set into the top few thousand customers in India with them. So I think the ability for us to deliver in cloud does open up easier routes to deployment and near customer segments.", "Gabriela Borges", "That's helpful. And Greg, as a follow-up, you mentioned a couple of big examples during your prepared remarks on cross-sell deals. I am curios, when you look collectively across the over 9,000 direct accounts that you have as a company, where you think the biggest patterns emerge on cross-sell? It sounds like a lot of it is proxy and DLP. Are there other areas or other product lines that you think are cross-selling particularly well?", "GregClark", "So I think we have got really strong traction with the proxy stack, CASB, DLP, multifactor auth and then upselling that into ability to process email. That is a great set of stuff where you have got to go get four vendors today and you can get one and it's a real crisis on cloud compliance right now and that's in that, top cohort. That's great. That is a really strong piece of business for us. And some of the examples we can see were like that.", "The other area which is great is, we are having in a pretty good time right now picking up the other adjacencies to the endpoint market. And the reason why, we won the Gartner Magic Quadrant this year on both the vision and executions not just because we are big and we can do a lot. We actually got there on ability to deliver a feature set that's relevant right now. We are now able with one agent to go in and take down all of the EDR pieces as well as the deception and then we can come back and then cross-sell our DLP endpoint in there as well. And later on as we talked about when we announced the Symantec Blue Coat merger, we will be delivering a very strong integration of that endpoint without proxy stack as well.", "We think that's the on ramp to the cloud for the future. And that's a really nice place for us as we have got in that cross-sell. We have got a number of angles that fit that sort of top 10,000 accounts and we have a sales force. And I think the number one thing that gave me a lot of conviction about Q3 was, could our sales force sell it. And the answer to that is, our sales force did sell it and you can see it in those billings numbers. And for those of you that as Sarah said, let's talked about the term, we know and we are going get you that data.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. I am sorry. Your line is open.", "John DiFucci", "Can you me okay?", "GregClark", "Hi John. Yes, you can go ahead.", "John DiFucci", "Hi Greg and Nick, both. I guess this questions is for both of you. So just one second. Sorry. We sort of get the mix shift and we really appreciate all the data you gave us. So we will get through that. We will go through that. It will take a little bit of time. But I guess I had two questions regarding that. I guess the first one is one that I keep getting emails from people on and I think it's a fair question. You gave guidance for this quarter a full month into the quarter. So given, at least my understanding of how deals close, especially with the Enterprise, it's just a little surprising that this would surprise you given when we gave guidance at that point that the quarter would shift that quickly in the last two months the quarter. So if you can just talk a little bit about that? And then secondly, if you have a customer who has been a proxy appliance user and he decides to go to cloud-based solutions or any sort of moving from anything to sort of a subscription, especially though when you have an appliance, what do you have to consider, if he is doing his job, consider alternative solutions at that point since he is making a change anyway? And I guess, how do you manage that risk?", "GregClark", "So let me take the last question first, John and I will pass it back over to Nick to give you some insights. So every time there is a set of proxies that come up for refresh and these dates are published on a website, everything that are on the planet tries to come in there and get those. Last time this happened, same thing, they even built webpages for it. So it's a competitive situation. And that's just the way it is.", "But switching it out is a little more difficult than just going to get a new one. There is policies in there that you have got to go change and all that kind of things. What we have done with the Blue Coat proxy data, is we have virtual appliances that are ratable that if you put them on the right underlying hardware platform with the right network stuff that was built for virtual machines, they are capacity comparable to a ProxySG piece of hardware. So those do move from hardware to virtual because it's easier for people to deal with than in their big VMware installations and things like that.", "Then we get the reason why people would buy more capacity. Often it is the roaming users and the roaming users are being picked up by the cloud form factor more often than not. And when they add the ability to take care of cloud applications through things like CASB, they actually prefer that that runs in an Amazon kind of instantiation. So we do see what would be the traditional upsell in a refresh being ratable in a pretty strong way.", "And then the last Blue Coat refresh, we picked up a lot of the other adjacencies at the time which were like the malware analyzers and the decryptors and that kind of stuff. The adjacencies in this refresh are the CASBs and the roaming user pieces which are all cloud based. So again, it is competitive. I think the other thing when people rely on channel checks to see how much the box movers are moving boxes, box move is not as relevant anymore as they used to be in this because there is SLAs and MSAs. And so the routes to some of the stuff is different than it was a few years ago, okay.", "John DiFucci", "Yes. That's pretty helpful.", "GregClark", "That will be in the fourth quarter.", "Nick Noviello", "Let me talk to you about that real quick. So John, you will recall, in our last quarter call we indicated that it's coming when we had a bigger pipeline. Coming into Q3, we had a bigger pipeline and we applied all the knowledge we had from Q2, i.e. ratable shift, linearity, et cetera, to that pipeline to come up with our numbers in our guidance range. And obviously there is a lot of detail that goes on and a lot of work that goes on around that.", "However, we also had back-end loaded quarters. And with back-end loaded quarters and what we indicated on that call last time, larger transactions, those can move from a product license based transaction to a ratable transaction. And when they do, that's going to impact. So we had an acceleration of that ratable mix and that acceleration happened in the end of the quarter and that's the net impact we have here.", "So we apply all of our logic to this and it accelerated in the quarter and that's what I was describing on a few of those other questions. We are trying to, obviously be thoughtful about that as we go forward. And there is really two things we are doing.", "Number one is, even more work scrutiny et cetera on the pipe and on the transaction that we are looking at for quarter what we know, what size those transaction are, et cetera. But in addition, we have not only taken just where the ratable got to, we are increasing that and we are increasing our expectations on ratable business because obviously we don't like being in a place where the forecast doesn't work out either. So we have made some additional changes to the go-forward.", "GregClark", "Guys, we really take full responsibility and apologize for not getting that right. We have talked about mix on the conference calls a number of times while we have been in transformation of Symantec. We talked about when we mixed lots of line items together on the same purchase order, it hurts what would be the in-period pieces of that. If you put a discount on it, it gets cut back into the maintenance pieces. We talked about the fact that we got it wrong and we saw more cloud and we did not expect to see the volumes that happened and that is definitely something that we are seriously doing better on now.", "Operator", "And at this time I am showing we have no further questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you for closing remarks.", "Cynthia Hiponia", "Great. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. And we look forward to updating you again on our next call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Symantec's fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings call.
