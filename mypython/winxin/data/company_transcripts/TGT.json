Thank you for joining us. For those of you here with us in the room, we\u2019re really excited that you joined us this year in our hometown and hopefully, you found the experience last night, the store tour, the exhibit this morning helped you get a deeper understanding of what we\u2019re working on.", "A couple of housekeeping items. First, there\u2019s a couple, I\u2019m going to literally read the slides. First of all, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Second, in today\u2019s remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.", "So, finally, something new this year for those of you on the webcast. You can submit questions. I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019re getting questions, so submit those. The team will get those questions to us and we will take some of those during the Q&A session after the speeches.", "So, with that, we can get started with Brian.", "Brian Cornell", "Well, thanks, John, and good morning. And thank you for joining us today in Minneapolis. John, Cathy and I really enjoyed spending time with you during last night tours and reception, and I hope all of you had a chance to explore even more this morning. While we can make slides or show videos, there is simply no substitute for being here, live and in person, walking the sales floor, talking to our teams, touching, feeling and experiencing new products and services, seeing for the first hand the future of Target.", "What so exciting for me is that last year at this time all we could do was talk about the future. Most of what we could show were still renderings, today those things are real. The work is well underway. We\u2019ve made a ton of progress against our priorities and as you saw today, our teams are more focused than ever and our guests are responding in kind. What a difference a year makes.", "Think back to this meeting 2017. The world could not have looked more different, coming out of soft holiday sales. The headlines were all about store closures, a catastrophic border tax and the looming retail apocalypse. That morning we had a tough message of our own. But one by one many of you pulled me aside that day, said, Brian, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re investing. We believe in your strategy. I\u2019d make the same moves if I was standing in your shoes. It was a long flight home.", "But let me tell you what happened as soon as we landed in Minneapolis. The very next morning we gathered our senior leadership team from every part of the country and we grounded them in our company purpose, making sure every decision we made from that moment forward was in service to our purpose, to help all families, discover the joy of everyday life. We talked about where we were and what it would take to continue to build the love our guests have for our brand. We talked about the things that makes Target unique, playing our own game. What it means for Target to really win.", "We talked a lot about urgency, getting things to market, testing, learning, doing it faster than ever before and rallying the organization around our multiyear plan, committing more than $7 billion to modernize every dimension in our business and lean into the things that truly sets Target apart, blending the best of our digital and physical shopping experience, reimagining our network of more than 1,800 source, as inspiring showrooms and neighborhood fulfillment centers.", "Moving into new smaller markets, creating digital capabilities that bring incredible ease and convenience to our guest lives and doing what Target does better than anyone else in the marketplace, creating great brands at scale and with style.", "And we talked about what was going to take to make all that happens, the power of our Target team, nearly 350,000 people all around the world. The connection they have to their community. The passion they have for our brand. I\u2019ve been in this business now for more than 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, never.", "The people who work at Target, they love the brand, they take great pride in taking care of our guests and our guest sees it every day. They know the people who work in their neighborhood store. They seek their expertise. They appreciate their hospitality and their friendly service.", "When you ask our guests, why they shop at Target, more often than not, they say it\u2019s because of people. So it should come as no surprise that given our teams drive and competitive spirit they never consider a forecast of foregone conclusion. It\u2019s just another challenge to raise the bar even higher.", "So last March we told our store teams, if you post positive comps in 2017, well, we told them they could wear jeans every weekend in 2018. Sure enough, if you are in the Target store on Sunday, you saw a lot of denim, because here\u2019s what happened next.", "[Video] (6:35-8:45)", "I have seen a video half dozen times now. But it still makes me smile. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what this team is accomplished. 2017 was quite a year. We introduced three new billion dollar brands, 10 new brands in all, 110 remodels, nearly 30 small formats, Herald Square, Houston, Hearth & Hand, new payment systems, new partnerships, new promotional strategies, a new mobile app and new fulfillment capabilities. Next day, same day pick up, Drive Up, and of course, tens of thousands of new personal shoppers delivering Target products from shipped.", "Early this morning we reported our fourth quarter and 2017 year end results, and you don\u2019t have to get too far to the numbers to see that our strategy is working. Guests like what we are doing. The investments we are making are taking root and they are driving results.", "Here are just some of the highlights, strong Q4 traffic, not just in digital, but importantly, in our stores, which led to a 3.6% comp increase. We saw that growth come across our business, as we gain market share in all five core merchandising categories. This was the fourth year in a row that digital grew by more than 25%. But it was our coast-to-coast network of neighborhood stores that enable that growth, as our stores fulfill more than half of our total digital volume.", "Given the strong sales performance and the benefits from the recent change in the tax code, we finished the fourth quarter with adjusted EPS of a $1.37 and $4.71 for the full year. But what\u2019s most encouraging to me is that we can hang these results on any one single aspect of our strategy, rather it\u2019s a sum of the parts. Everything working together and everything working that carried the day. While we are obviously pleased with the results, there\u2019s no time for a victory lap, because you know and I know we still have a lot of work left to do.", "So while 2017 was all about putting down a plan, getting the wheels turning in the right direction, 2018 is about acceleration, leveraging our greatest assets and leaning in to our competitive strength, all in service of making Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop.", "So as many of you experienced this morning, newness and innovation are essential elements of our strategy. Our teams are exploring retail applications for just about every buzzword you can imagine. AI, CGI machine learning and while we are looking for future opportunities to build adjacent businesses and disruptive technology, the vast majority of our teams time and talent is aimed at our core and advancing our investments around several key strategic categories, creating a more inspiring and connected shopping experience, reimagining our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, by positioning our stores at the heart of our network, continuing to reinvent our own brand portfolio and investing in what is by far our most valuable asset, our team.", "These are the choices we are making to ensure Target continues to stand out from the pack and further distinguish our brand in the minds of the guests. And today I\u2019m happy to report we are either on pace or ahead of schedule in delivering what we laid out one year ago and it\u2019s all because of our people. They are in every sense our greatest point of difference and that\u2019s true across every corner of our organization.", "Consider for a moment what it takes to bring a shirt to market. The buyers, textile designers, sourcing managers, fabric engineers, all the planners, the pricing analysts, the marketers, the packaging experts, the global trade managers and those visual merchandisers, every one of those jobs is held by a Target team member.", "The talent and expertise you see it every single node in that global value chain gives us an unrivaled competitive advantage. That\u2019s what\u2019s equally important is the fact that for that shirt when it reaches the store, while our team members who greet our guests and help them find what they\u2019re looking for, that\u2019s why we are investing in training and teaching, not only to sell the shirt, but to sell the whole outfit.", "We are also providing new tools to manage task more efficiently. So we have more time for personalized service and we are creating new pathways for advancement, developing new skills and leaning in how to manage, motivate and lead others.", "During the past year, we have made great strides in changing our service model and added payroll in areas where our guest expects a more human touch, and of course, I\u2019m really proud of the leadership position we took in October, raising our starting wage to $11 and committing to $15 an hour by 2020.", "I will tell you that within days of that announcement, applications for seasonal positions spiked by more than 30% and we had a much stronger pool of talent to hire from. But the benefits of that investment go much further than just the short-term seasonal boost. Our leadership position on wage establishes Target as an employer of choice and we will drive preference for years to come.", "And now you\u2019re seeing a number of employers inside and outside a retail follow our lead and today I\u2019m happy to announce we will raise our starting wage again to $12, starting with current team members this spring.", "So when we talk about elevating the shopping experience, the work is all about connecting physical and digital, and empowering our people to bring in all the life. Despite all the changes across the consumer landscape, one thing remains absolutely true, our guests love to shop. Our team is laser focused on creating the kinds of experiences that are worth the trip or an extra click.", "And you saw that first hand last night, the before and after images or downtown store, well, they tell the whole story. It\u2019s not just about better and more modern design. It\u2019s about creating experiences based on how we want our guest to feel when they shop. It\u2019s about being welcoming.", "So in beauty this means making sure our guests see themselves in the product and the marketing, asking for what we can do to encourage them to explore even more. We want them to feel inspired. So in Apparel, it\u2019s not just presentation. It\u2019s about helpful service across the entire experience we also want to make sure we continue to make it really, really easy.", "And by no means will then experience look the same from store to store, each day today 42,000 people walk past our Herald Square store during their evening commute. Not one of them wants to walk out with a 50 inch flat screen TV in one hand and try to hail a cab with the other. Every design decision, every merchandising choice has to be made with the guest experience being top of mind.", "Now if you haven\u2019t been to our next-generation store in Houston, I can assure you, it is worth the trip. You\u2019ve often heard me talk about the power of [ph] and (17:30). Our new store in Houston is really the physical manifestation of that phrase. It was designed for ease and inspiration, style and essentials, mass and specialty, and it\u2019s a glimpse into our future, not because we plan open dozens of new stores just like it, but because we\u2019re picking and choosing elements from that prototype to create customized concepts for every store we remodeled.", "Last year we committed to remodeling 600 stores over three years and now we are going to raise the bar. In 2017 we delivered 110. This year we will triple that pace and do 325 more. We will keep going at that rate, completing over 1,000 remodels by 2020.", "We will also open up more small format stores in prime urban markets, including three more tomorrow. And when we put it together, the aggregate investment we are making in key markets like Chicago, LA and right here in Minneapolis, we will exceed several hundred million dollars across each one of those communities.", "We are also investing to bring the best of digital into our physical experience. Consider this stack during the holidays. Our stores fulfill more than two-thirds of our digital orders. So now if I\u2019m sitting at my desk and I order something from target.com, but I pick it up on my way home, does it make sense to call it a digital transaction, if I buy a patio set with my phone, while I\u2019m sitting on the store display model, is that a digital sale, our finance folks would say, yes.", "I can tell you, our guests could care less and our technology teams, they are working hard to create new tools to completely erase that line altogether. For example, we folded our popular Cartwheel app into our flagship app to simplify the experience and we introduced wallet. So our guest can find deals and pay more easily and faster than ever before.", "On target.com we added a 360 degree digital shopping experience. We are investing in augmented reality. We are elevating our storytelling around key brands and key like moments. And we are finding new ways to extend our assortment and better leverage our platform.", "So not only are we creating better showrooms at our stores, we are also using these buildings in a profoundly different way. They should be hubs for commerce and community, and given the fact that we are nearly 10 miles from every doorstep in America, we see a huge advantage in leveraging that proximity. We just needed to realign our network.", "So a few years ago, we started shipping digital orders from our back rooms. We started small and we worked out the kinks. We focused on getting orders to our guests with greater efficiency, reducing inventory across our network and dramatically accelerating delivery times.", "But that was just the start. In August we acquired Grand Junction, a technology platform that enables us to connect third-party carriers and provide same-day delivery service. In October, here in Minneapolis we piloted Driver Up, pull up, pop your trunk, route with your order in less than two minutes, rain or shine.", "Then in December we announced the acquisition of Shipt, a technology platform which is allowing us to provide tens of thousands of personal shoppers encloses that last mile delivery gap from days to minutes.", "I can tell you I\u2019ve spent time with the Shipt team, talking to their network of shoppers. What really stands out for me is the people. The personal relationships they build with their customers. Think about people who love Target shopping, who are out there shopping for Target lovers. It\u2019s a great combination and John is going to show a lot more details about where we are headed, but I wanted to give you a sense for how we are moving even faster to take them to scale.", "Today we are announcing how we are going to expand our same-day delivery service from Manhattan to all five boroughs and several other big-city markets. With Drive Up we are taking our 50 store test nationwide to nearly 1,000 locations coast-to-coast. And finally, I\u2019m really excited about this. We are going to offer free two-day delivery on hundreds of thousands of items on target.com. No membership, no extra fees.", "When you think about all the bold moves we have made none was more ambitious than our plan to reinvent our own brand portfolio. We promised 12 new brands in 18 months. Standing here today, I can tell you, we are well ahead of schedule.", "In 2017 we brought 10 new brands to market and we are introduced two more, each one focused on replacing long existing brands or filling a wide space in our current portfolio. Think about A New Day in ready to wear, JoyLab in activewear, Goodfellow for men, in home Project 62 and Hearth & Hand with Magnolia, a partner with America\u2019s favorite family Chip and Joanna Gaines.", "Each one of those brands delivered exceptional quality and unbeatable value. In a world where everything is increasingly commoditized each one helps differentiate Target and build preference for our overall brand. Across the Board the results have been phenomenal.", "[Video] (23:42-24:19)", "While each brand has delivered incremental sales, they are working hard across our assortment, driving traffic to other categories and inspiring cross shopping. For example, we were highly intentional about launching Hearth & Hand early in the holiday season. It was an invitation for our guest to explore and an opportunity for inspiration, driving results across home, but also helping categories like food as well.", "And while our design and marketing team will tell you we set an incredible pace in 2017. We are only going to move faster and faster in the months to come. Last month we launched Opal House in Home and last week we debut a limited time only collection with Hunter, a long admired English Heritage brand.", "So before I turn it over to John and Cathy, I want to finish up where I started. 2017 was a big year for Target. We laid out an ambitious agenda, blending digital and physical, creating new experiences, reimagining our network of stores as hubs for commerce and community, expanding into new markets and reinventing our brands.", "We made bold investments, more than 100 remodels, dozens of new formats, key acquisitions, blockbuster brands, industry-leading investments in our team and our team delivered. We are headed into 2018 with a road that couldn\u2019t be more clear.", "Our strategy is working. Our guests are responding and we are accelerating the pace, pushing even harder. Moving faster than ever before, three times as many remodels, dozens of new stores, new services, new solutions. Moving from concepts like Drive Up to scale and taking Shipt nationwide and you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in our team and rollout one new brand after another all year long. Putting it all together, this is a strategy is going to make Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop.", "So, now, let me welcome John Mulligan, our Chief Operating Officer to the stage. Thank you.", "John Mulligan", "Good morning, everyone. You just heard from Brian that the Target team delivered on the commitments we made last year and then some, from standing up new stores to remodeling existing ones, rolling out new fulfillment options and expanding capabilities to get products to our guests even faster.", "We are changing our operations to use our stores in new ways. While we continue to offer an exceptional in-store experience and it\u2019s all made possible by the teams that bring those buildings to life.", "We have more than 300,000 team members in our stores, face-to-face with millions of guests and tens of thousands more behind the scenes, creating, ordering, moving product and developing a technology, automation and tools that allow us to serve the guests in ways we hadn\u2019t even dreamed of just a few years ago. They are the experts, the inventors and the personalities behind every guest experience, and the reason we have made meaningful progress to our putting our strategies in motion.", "Just about everything our team has done and continues to do is in service of supporting our stores as hubs. Hubs that offer a great shopping experience, support our communities and fulfill digital orders. They are at the center of how we are welcoming and inspiring guests, and how we are making it really easy for them to shop at Target.", "So here is the question I get all the time, in today\u2019s digital world, why invest in stores and for us the business case is simple. When a digital order comes in, we basically have two choices, fulfill it from one of a few fulfillment centers across the country or ship it out the back at the local store.", "We are fortunate to have more than 1,800 stores in really great locations, prime real estate, just down the street from our guests. So we can deliver it faster, nearly two days faster than if we send it from a regional fulfillment center. Plus the inventory is already there, because our stores feature a curated assortment we know our guests want, naturally it\u2019s the same merchandise they buy most often online. And when one stores of an item we have other stores nearby that can help fill the order.", "Even more, our stores flexibility to ramp up when things get busy is incredibly powerful. This past Cyber Monday our store shipped millions of orders out their backdoors, without that capacity we would need a twice as many fulfillment centers as we have today and when peak was over the stores wrapped right back down. So we avoid spending all that capital on new facilities, we would really only need a few weeks out of the year.", "Now that\u2019s all great, but here is the real kicker and probably the thing you all care about most. Shipping from a store is the best way to lower the total cost of digital fulfillment. We hear a lot about optimizing, picking and packing, which can help make fulfilling an online order more efficient. But step back and look at the total cost of fulfillment. There are fixed and variable costs required to run and staff the fulfillment center, but no question shipping is by far the largest chunk.", "Going after the variable costs while really important, only get you so far, to lower the total cost you can\u2019t ignore the big dog. Shipping from a local store optimizes the most dominant standalone cost by dollars per order. Because we haven\u2019t sunk capital into a massive fulfillment center, our overhead and other fixed costs essentially go away.", "You\u2019ve all seen our strong digital growth and we expect that to continue. So at some point we will need to build more upstream facilities just to manage volume. But we are not there yet. Using our stores to fulfill millions of orders lets us delay those investments or avoid some of them altogether. Because our stores are the fastest and most efficient fulfillment method, they\u2019ll continue to be our preferred shipping point in the long run.", "Bottomline, shipping from our stores moves product faster and we do it at a significantly lower cost. I\u2019m confident none of you need a spreadsheet to see that that\u2019s a really good thing. For a company like us with well located assets already in place across the country, this strategy makes complete sense.", "But the entire supply chain operation has to support it. With everything we are asking a store to do, they need more product than ever before, we are replenishing the shelves and fulfilling digital orders, all in one building from the same pool of inventory, so product has to come fast and often. But there\u2019s already so much happening in a store. So the trick is to send them only the right amount of product at the right time and quickly.", "You all know our team has been building an entirely new operating model for our supply chain. Last year, I told you about our plans to become more flexible in how we move product. The goal is to be able to move inventory in any quantity, whether that\u2019s cases, pallets or individual units. So we can replenish only what we sold.", "That might mean sending a truck with bottles of shampoo next to cases of catch-up and pallets of water. We send the store precisely what it needs to restock the shelf. It keeps product from clogging up the back room and makes it easier for our teams to manage the inventory. It\u2019s a model we have been testing with a distribution center in the Northeast and it\u2019s working.", "The store is supported by that DC have reduced their backroom inventory by more than a third and cut hub stocks to half of what we see across the rest of the chain. Of course, we did all that with an entirely new facility and we are expanding that operation to support more stores in the Northeast, but we are also testing how to work to retrofit our existing network and by the fourth quarter, multiple DCs will begin the journey to evolve to this small.", "To do it we are scaling some of the most promising robotic solutions we have tested in the past year. That automation makes it possible for us to sort and move huge volumes of single units without putting an unsustainable burden on our DC teams or the stores.", "With less inventory in the back of the store, we can dedicate more room to digital fulfillment. This past holiday season we tested a new design at the backroom, complete with more pack stations and dedicated space to sort orders for delivery and capacity shot up. It was incredible as orders came pouring in on Cyber Monday, the teams were picking, packing and sorting boxes, just like a fulfillment center. And with enhanced layout and process, they did up to six times the volume of the year before.", "Best of all, guest got their packages faster. Nearly every order that came into those stores that day was picked, packed and ready to ship in 24 hours. This year to keep up with digital demand that continues to far outpaced the industry, we are introducing this new backroom design to more than 150 stores and we are reengineering the operation in more than 1,000 others. With this additional capacity our stores plan to ship nearly double the number of packages for Cyber Monday 2018 compared to last year.", "That\u2019s good news, because as I said earlier, shipping more order from our stores reduces our costs, while allowing us to move faster and speed is the part our guest will notice. But the changes we\u2019ve been making across our operation these past two years, the average delivery time for an order was nearing two days. But we weren\u2019t doing it consistently enough to make that promise to our guests, until now.", "We are announcing today that we are offering free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items, no membership required. With more mature fulfillment capabilities we are updating our promise and resetting our guest expectations of what\u2019s possible. It\u2019s an offer that\u2019s compelling and competitive and it\u2019s just the start.", "Speaking of being competitive, one of the biggest leaps we made this past year was our swift moving to same day delivery. With our acquisition of Shipt, Target gain the ability to deliver product to our guests in hours or even minutes. We knew Shipt was a fit for Target right from the start.", "Here a start up delivery company that\u2019s gone from one market in Alabama to more than 70 markets in just three years. So the operation is strong and proven to scale. It\u2019s a company built on speed but focused on service, which means working the Shipt we could jump years ahead in our fulfillment plans, without sacrificing the guest\u2019s experience. Staying true to how we\u2019ve grown for more than 50 years. Take a look.", "[Video] (35:31-37:42)", "Just eight weeks after our announcement we began offering millions of guests the ability to shop online for more than 50,000 items across groceries, essentials, electronics, baby and more, and have those products delivered that same day.", "Already we brought Target same-day delivery to Shipt members across the Southeast and in the Twin Cities and we are rolling into new markets almost every week. By holiday we will be the first retailer to offer same-day delivery in nearly every major market.", "As you just heard, the beauty of Shipt is that it\u2019s not just a transaction. Our guests will get a personalized service and care that these shoppers offer unlike anyone else. While also accessing a wide assortment of products, priced right daily and delivered in hours. That whole package is something no one else is offering today.", "At the same time, guests still like to come into our stores and shop. But for guests in urban areas like Manhattan, they can only buy what they can carry home. Last year, our team saw a need and knew we could help.", "Just weeks later they brought a service at our Tribeca location in New York City where guest shop the store and then play a fat -- flat fee, but the cost of a short cab ride, very cheap, very inexpensive to have that order delivered that same day.", "Today we are offering delivery from four stores in New York and guests love it. It\u2019s quick and efficient and it\u2019s all possible, because the technology we acquired from Grand Junction last year. The platform assigns, every order to the most logical local carrier, which is what allows us to efficiently scale the service beyond a single store or market.", "Starting this spring we will go even bigger in the city, offering the service in 25 more New York locations and reaching all five boroughs by Q4. And at the same time we roll it out in other markets like Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and DC.", "Delivery goes a long way in making our guest lives easier, but just as meaningful as when a team member can put formula and diapers right in the back of a minivan, saving the guest from unloading the car seats to run inside.", "Last summer we started testing Drive Up in the Twin Cities. It took order pick up to the parking lot where our stores teams will walk the order out to a guest car. We saw the demand for it right away and guest feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In fact, Drive Up\u2019s net promoter score is consistently over 80 and those you are familiar with that metric know that\u2019s incredibly high.", "This spring at the same time we take Shipt across the country we will roll up Drive Up putting the service in nearly 1,000 stores by the end of the year and every fulfillment option, shipping, delivering, walking orders to the car, the store is at the center. It also continues to be a destination for millions of guests every week, while fielding much of our digital growth at the same time. So we have to be sure they are equipped to do both.", "Brian and I spent a lot of time visiting stores across the country. A little over year ago we toured a few markets together and it was clear, stores that we lean on so heavily needed some love, not only did the design need to refresh and by that I mean losing the neon and the vintage signs, but many of the layouts weren\u2019t set up to handle digital fulfillment.", "We walked stores where the team was holding order pick up packages in backroom meeting areas, because they didn\u2019t have space up front, or boxing orders in one of our backroom cranny that could fit a pack station. So our store design team developed a new prototype that would do it all.", "They re-imagine the entrances, sales floor and fixtures to make shopping our stores easier and more inspiring. At the same time they extended the order pick up counter, built a Drive Up lane and rearrange the backroom to handle a growing number of digital orders. In November, we open a new store in Houston with this latest generation of design. Check it out.", "[Video] (41:39-43:28)", "We are incorporating elements of this latest design as we remodel more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three years, including the 325 we will do in 2018. But it won\u2019t be the same in every store, we will adjust and evolve, applying what we learned and leaning into what works and we will continue to design experience that feels relevant for each location, from cinema lights on the former theater in Brooklyn, the big skylights at the store near Sunny UC Irvine.", "The fulfillment capabilities our stores gain are critical for our strategy, but so is the improved guest experience that comes from updating a store that hasn\u2019t been touched in years and the difference is real. After stores remodel, traffic grows and we see the 2% to 4% sales lift on average that we would expect it.", "In addition to the individual stores we are remodeling, we have made investments in key markets. Take the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Last year we remodeled 28 stores across the metro and guests noticed. The refresh design is inviting guests come back in and to shop, and the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. We saw with Dallas and with LA 25 a few years ago that we can learn a lot from putting our latest thinking into one market. So this year we will go big in our hometown and remodel nearly 30 stores in the Twin Cities, on our way to putting the latest design into all area stores over the next few years.", "Even as we re-imagine our existing stores, we are continuing to find opportunities to bring an elevated experience to new guests and we are doing that with our small format stores. The flexible design allows to open in areas where our traditional big-box footprints simply wouldn\u2019t fit, city centers, dense neighborhoods, even college campuses, they bring us into new markets like Vermont, which will officially put us in all 50 states and closer to new guests, like students at the University of Cincinnati and Penn State.", "Part of joining a new community is being a good neighbor. So our teams go deep into those neighborhoods to really know those guests and tailor the experience to what they need. It\u2019s a capability we built and refined over time.", "You can see that most easily with our assortment. Of course, we have got portable electronics, and mac & cheese in our campus stores. But we also get specific to a neighborhood, even within the same city. Chicago is a great example. The assortment in our Lakeview Aspen store is focused on baby and kids products, because that\u2019s what those guessed buy most, while just seven blocks away Lakeview Belmont over indexes on top selling categories like home d\u00e9cor and liquor.", "Last year we opened nearly 30 small format stores, doubling the number we\u2019d opened up to that point. This year we will add another 30. In fact we are opening a few of them tomorrow in DC, Boston and Chicago, and we will do another 30 in 2019, putting us on paste to operate more than 130 small formats by the end of next year. So we can meet the needs of even more guests across the country.", "Now all that said, it\u2019s the team inside those buildings that make us Target and our teams work hard to deliver for our guests and serve our communities every single day. So we are continuing to invest in them.", "You heard our announcement of increasing our minimum wage to $12 an hour this year on our way to $15 an hour by 2020 and while pay is important our investment goes deeper than that. We are also giving our team opportunities to develop and use new school -- skills that offer outstanding guest service, while also building the basket.", "Gone are the days when the team member shows up on Monday to work on Apparel and Wednesday to work on electronics. Instead we are placing people based on their interests and their background and providing data and paid training to help them truly be specialists in their areas. In fact we have committed hundreds of thousands of payroll hours for training that helps them succeed in their jobs but also in their careers.", "At the same time we are giving them tools to better serve the in-store guests. Last year we launched an application on the team member device that allows them to order something for a guest if the item they want wasn\u2019t in their store. This holiday season it save the sale and extended the aisle for thousands of guests.", "And soon our teams will use the same technology to save guests from standing in line. When the check lanes are full, our team can use the devices to give us more capacity at point-of-sale. They are able bring up a guest\u2019s full order on the spot, busting lines and saving time. It\u2019s just another way they are equipped to make a guest experience easier and more convenient.", "We have always said that the guest is at the center of everything we do. So it only makes sense that are 1,800 stores in neighborhoods across the country are at the center of how we do it. It\u2019s why you will see our progress continue to support our stores, whether it\u2019s modernizing the supply chain, standing up new small formats, building on digital capabilities, or most importantly, investing in our team, all of it is in service of delivering a retail experience guests can\u2019t find anywhere but Target. Thank you.", "[Video] (48:52-50:05)", "Cathy Smith", "Wow, just like Brian said, what a difference a year makes. Coming out of this meeting a year ago we were really confident that we\u2019re on the right path, even so, we knew we would be a show me story for a while. We need to begin putting some points on the board to show that our strategy was working and now that started happening. But let me be clear, I know for some of you we still remain a show me story and we remain confident in our path. But I\u2019d all -- but I think we all agree we are in a much different place today.", "Last year was the beginning of a multiyear effort to position our business for long-term profitable growth. It was an investment year, as we ramped up our capital spending and devoted a portion of our operating income to reposition Target in this new era of retail.", "Looking back, I\u2019m happy to say that we made all of those investments and more, and with those investments our business performed far ahead of our expectations, both on the toplines and the bottomlines.", "In particular multiple data points either met or exceeded our expectations, including a 2% to 4% sales lift on average from our store remodels, compelling financial performance from our new small formats, including sales productivity, margins and ROIC, a strong guest response to our new brands, digital sales growth of more than 25% for the fourth year in a row, disciplined execution and a positive guest response to our new -- a test of our new fulfillment centers -- fulfillment options and following our investments in being priced right daily, our guest noticed with our sales at everyday low prices were up more than $4 billion compared to 2016. And finally, the most important metric, guest traffic, it accelerated as the year progressed.", "Last year we said that 2018 would be a transition year and that view is still appropriate today. Our priorities remain the same, but you\u2019ll see a rapid acceleration in our pace. To support that acceleration we will grow our capital investment to well over $3 billion this year. To provide a differentiated shopping experience we will triple the size of our remodel program.", "We will open more than 30 small format stores and new neighborhoods. We will expand fulfillment options into new markets across the country, including Drive Up and the same day delivery enabled by Shipt acquisition.", "We will build capacity to ship more orders from our stores, increasing speed and reducing cost. We will continue investing in our supply chain to enhance the store replenishment and digital fulfillment. We will differentiate with more exclusive brands combined with our curated assortment of national brands. And we will continue to monitor and maintain the right balance of everyday prices and promotions by category. These are important investments to create the Target of tomorrow, which will position this company for growth in 2019 and beyond.", "In 2018 we expect that our EPS from our core business will stabilize. This reflects several profit headwinds, including accelerated depreciation resulting from our remodel program, continued cost pressure from the rapid rollout of our new fulfillment options, ongoing wage investments in the face of a tight labor market across the country and the impact of last year\u2019s price and value investments, which will annualize throughout 2018.", "However, unlike last year we will expect these pressures will be mostly offset by multiple tailwinds in our business, including the mix benefit of continued strength in our high margin categories, lower unit costs for digital fulfillment driven by our supply chain, modest expense leverage from a low single-digit increase in comparable sales, and of course, continued cost control across every aspect of our business.", "And finally, beyond operating income, we expect to benefit from the continued focus on disciplined capital deployment through lower interest expense and modest EPS leverage from share repurchase.", "This highlights one of the most important aspects of our business. It\u2019s ability to generate cash year after year. Look at 2017 even with an operating margin decline driven by our investments we generated almost $7 billion of cash from operations. That is $1.5 billion more than 2016, nearly a 30% increase, despite the massive changes happening in our industry. So even without Tax Reform, we would have entered 2018 in a really strong position.", "Now let me pause for a moment and talk about Tax Reform. As a domestic retailer we have long had one of the highest effective tax rates around, well over 30% in recent years. So we are certainly encourage the Tax Reform has put our company, our industry on a more level playing field and made the United States more competitive globally.", "But the question we\u2019ve heard a lot since Tax Reform was passed, what are you going to do with the benefits? And when you think about that question, it is important to realize we didn\u2019t wait for Tax Reform to make big investments in our business and our team, because we were confident they were the right long-term choices.", "Think back to our second quarter conference call in August when we first announced we plan to invest more than $3 billion in our business in 2018 and then a month later when we took decisive action in support of our single most important differentiator, our team. We announced higher investments in hours training to better equip our team to provide an outstanding guest experience. And to support our team members, we announced we would raise Target\u2019s national minimum wage to $11 an hour as part of a plan to reach $15 by the end of 2020. And again today we have made another step forward with the announcement of our national starting wage is moving to $12.", "Beyond investments in our team, we are accelerating our capital investments as well. Today we are raising our CapEx guidance to arrange around $3.5 billion dollars in 2018, reflecting the incremental investments in both our stores and our supply chain in support of the priorities I outlined earlier.", "So for us the question -- the answer to question, what are you going to do in light of Tax Reform is simple, we are investing in our business and our team to support Target\u2019s long-term sustainable growth, using the same approach we always have.", "Now you\u2019ve heard us say it so many times, we first look to invest in projects that promise to have -- to generate long-term value, then we want to support our dividend to extend the record -- our record of annual increases, and finally, we look to return any excess cash beyond those first two priorities within the limits of our middle A credit rating.", "So, with that, let\u2019s cover a few details underlying our financial expectations for 2018 and then we\u2019ll talk about the first quarter. Back in January, we outlined our expectations for a low single-digit increase in comparable sales this year and a full year adjusted EPS of $5.15 to $5.45, and today those expectations remain the same.", "Among the drivers we expect our operating margin rate will be down about 20 basis points this year, reflecting the net impact of the headwinds and tailwinds I outlined earlier. Across the lines of the P&L we are expecting relatively small changes in gross margin and SG&A in 2018, which together should net to approximately zero.", "So in essence this year\u2019s expected decline in our operating margin rate will be driven entirely by $175 million increase in depreciation and amortization. One note, this is -- this expected increase is smaller than I outlined in our last conference call. Since then we have continued to refine our outlook and expect less year-over-year D&A pressure in the year as it goes on specifically in the third and fourth quarters.", "Beyond operating metrics, we expect our interest expense to decrease about $60 million this year, reflecting last year\u2019s debt retirement and refinancing activities conducted by our treasury team. And finally, we expect our consolidated tax rate to be in the low to mid-20% range, lower than in recent -- recent history in light of Tax Reform.", "Now I\u2019ll turn briefly to our expectations for the first quarter. On the topline, we are planning for a low single-digit increase in our first quarter comparable sales. We are expecting a moderate increase in our first quarter gross margin rate, which will be more than offset by an increase in our SG&A expense rate and we are expecting an increase in our first quarter D&A expense of about $80 million consistent with the outlook I provided on our last conference call.", "Altogether, this adds up to a decline in operating margin rate of 60 basis points to 80 basis points in the first quarter, combined with a reduction in our interest expense of about $20 million and the benefit of the lower tax rate we are expecting first quarter adjusted EPS to be $1.25 to $1.45.", "One final note on our guidance. As you began seeing in our results last year, our new stores are starting to have a meaningful impact on our total sales growth. As a result, in 2018 for both the first quarter and the full year we expect that our new stores will add approximately 50 basis points to our total sales growth.", "So now I want to step back and talk a minute about how our financial model is changing. While we are not going to provide long-term guidance today, we can offer a strategic view. With the changes we\u2019re making to our business model, we expect our financial model to evolve as well. Like the past we will continue to focus on growing traffic sales and profits enabled by our strategic investments we\u2019ve highlighted today, and our stores will be right at the center of that growth, providing an outstanding shopping experience along with fast and efficient digital fulfillment in support of a rapidly growing suite of convenient options.", "By placing our stores at the center, we expect our business will generate somewhat higher asset turns and somewhat lower operating margins than we\u2019ve seen historically. This evolution will support continued outstanding after-tax returns on invested capital, something that\u2019s been a strength of this company for a very long time.", "In fact, if you think back in our history, this isn\u2019t the first time our business model and financial model have changed in service of an evolving consumer. Remember our company began over 100 years ago as a traditional department store. It had a business model that generated higher margin rates and lower asset turns compared with Target stores, yet even as we completely transformed our business model from department stores to Target stores, our company has generated strong returns on capital for decades.", "Even in 2018 an investment year, we earned a very healthy 14% after-tax ROIC and that\u2019s after we exclude the one-time benefits from Tax Reform. This is performance that many in our industry would love. And in 2018 we expect ROIC to move beyond 14% even in the face of increase in capital spending.", "As we look past 2018, we don\u2019t believe that margin rates are going to unsustainably low levels and we can clearly see a path to evolve our financial model and reward investors by delivering growth and attractive returns consistent with the long-term record of this great company. We know we serve as stewards of a company that will have a very long history and I can assure you that this leadership team is all in, in sustaining that great legacy we\u2019ve inherited.", "So now I want to end my remarks where Brian began with a shout out to our team. As soon as I came to Target I quickly realized how special this team really is. I see it every day that I\u2019m on our stores, walking the sales floor or when I\u2019m visiting our distribution centers are every day in our headquarters.", "No matter where they are or what they do, when you spend time with our team, you feel first-hand the pride they have in our company, our brand and the role Target serves in every community we are in.", "They share a common purpose to bring joy to our guest lives and they project an infectious sense of optimism. They see clearly that Target will succeed if we focus on the long-term and make the right choices, for our business, for our team, for our guests and our shareholders.", "So while there\u2019s no question that times were tough a year ago, our teams passion and energy never faded. Our team embraced the challenge to move faster and think bigger, and begin moving Target from a show me story to a long-term success story again. So I want to say thank you to the entire Target team for everything you do. It\u2019s a privilege to work with you as we write this new chapter in our history.", "So now I am going to turn it back over to Brian for a brief wrap up and then we\u2019ll move to questions. Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "So I love the way Cathy just brought it all together. We have an incredibly talented team at Target and they truly delivered in 2017. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of their ambition, their passion for the brand and the way they always do the right thing for our guests.", "When you think about 2017, you heard it from Cathy and John, it was in every sense an investment year. We made big bets on new brands, new experiences and capabilities. We leaned into new partnerships and empowered our people. 2017 was a year of progress.", "As we look to the year ahead, 2018 is all about scale and acceleration. So we are tripling the remodel program. We will add another 30 small formats. We will introduce many new brands. We are rolling out new service models and game changing fulfillment capabilities, and making even deeper investments in our team. And I\u2019m really confident about what\u2019s next.", "I\u2019ll be the first to say, we still have a lot of work to do. The competition is fierce. The pace of change is unrelenting and our guest deserves the very best. But I couldn\u2019t be more bullish about Targets prospects.", "The strategy we are pursuing is working. Our guests are responding and now our team is more than ready to pick up the pace, and move faster than we ever have before, with one goal in mind to make Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop.", "[Video] (1:08:3-1:10:01)", "All right. So I am going to ask John and Cathy to join us on stage. We are going to answer some of your questions. In addition to questions in the room here today, we also have questions coming from our webcast. We are going to try to make sure we incorporate those into the approximate 30 minutes we have for Q&A today. So we\u2019ve got mic runners. They will have bulls-eyes in their hand, I would ask as you ask your question if you can just pause, identify yourself, we can see many of you, but not very well. So why don\u2019t we start with sitting in right up front. I can see up to about the second, so it was an advantage.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. Good morning. Thanks, Brian.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I want to focus on two items that I have been pressuring margins, first, investments and capabilities, investments being the catchall including wage? And then the second pressure point is the shift to lower margin channel and can ask you to comment on each, where you are in terms of your spend, the SG&A guide sort of implies that we\u2019ve reached some peak level and we are going to taper off and then second with regard to the mix shift online, where are you in that journey. You said the customer is agnostic, are you financially agnostic?", "Brian Cornell", "Yeah. So let me start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Cathy and John. I think as we outlined today. We have made significant investments in last year, in our team, in new capabilities and new brands. You are going to see that stabilize as we go into 2018 and as Cathy mentioned in our outlook, we expect to see gross margin rates stabilize, if not slightly improve in 2018, offset by some of the investments we will make in SG&A.", "So I think we have reached the point of general stability in our model. We are going to continue to invest. It\u2019s a period of now acceleration. But we have spent a lot of time over the last three years, testing and validating our investments, making sure the right thing for our guests, the right thing for our shareholders, they are going to be sustainable and they are also going to provide the right return on invested capital and I think you saw that today in our outlook.", "So, again, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in 2018. It is a year of acceleration. But we are accelerating based on the validation that we saw in \u201818 and the confidence that we are going to continue to drive great returns.", "Cathy Smith", "The only thing I would add, I mean is, kind of longer-term that perspective of as our business model is evolving, I am using the stores at the center of that strategy, we do expect that you\u2019ll see continued really terrific ROIC or after-tax ROIC. And so kind of probably lower operating margins that we\u2019ve seen historically not inconsistent with where we are today, but really strong continued asset efficiency, which will drive the ROIC, so growth in ROIC.", "Brian Cornell", "And your question about digital and the mix between the two channels, as I said several times today, we really want to make Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop, allow our guests to interface with great stores and even better store experiences as we remodel, give them a number of options for fulfillment, whether it\u2019s order online and pick up in our store, now Drive Up to our lot and pop that trunk and we will put it right in there, use Shipt to provide same-day delivering in hours if not minutes and convenient service right to their home. So we have to be agnostic, let the guest decide.", "But one of the great highlights from our fourth quarter was the fact that we saw really strong traffic and growth both in our stores and our digital channel, and we expect as we go into 2018 to continue to drive positive growth into our stores to drive positive comps in stores that\u2019s critically important and to continue to be a leader in digital growth. I think the investments we\u2019re making in Shipt, in Drive Up and other services positions Target uniquely as we move into this next era of retailing. Right over here.", "Wayne Hood", "Just to follow up on his question, looking at the spin rate in remodels maybe peaking by 2020 the wage investments, it\u2019s actually peaking then as well. Why wouldn\u2019t you expect operating margins to lift in 2020 given the run-off in D&A and the spent is actually over? And then I have a question about, John, if you talk a little bit about the execution -- a lot of I heard -- what we have seen so far today is absence some of the improved processes, but it didn\u2019t really address maybe the headwind in the store, it\u2019s the modular issue that the systems will get the right quantities, but the challenge is the modular are not really set in a way that allows that the flow very as nice as you would like see. So how do you address that the modular side is the store format begins to change over time?", "Brian Cornell", "John, let me start with the first part of the question. And Wayne you are absolutely right. As we get into the out years, we are going to see our remodel schedule begin to normalized, right now we are in a catch-up state and as we accelerate over the next three years, obviously, we will touch the vast majority of our stores. So in the out years we do expect that to normalize. But we have a lot of work to do in these next few years. It\u2019s all about making sure we execute our plan and touch and enhance the experience in as many stores as possible before we returned to a normal remodel schedule.", "John Mulligan", "I\u2019m sorry, Wayne, I didn\u2019t fully understand your second part of your question.", "Wayne Hood", "I probably didn\u2019t ask it right, but I will ask it again.", "John Mulligan", "Yeah.", "Wayne Hood", "So the challenge to me has always been on store replenishment side was the modulars really are not of the size that allows you to get a full case back on to the modular\u2026", "Brian Cornell", "Yeah.", "Wayne Hood", "\u2026and you can do all the backroom maneuvering that you want to do that gives you so far, but those modulars over time since we have to change to allow for better quantities, what you want to and then you take into account how the store is changing and what modulars may or may not present there in five years to 10 years now you maybe look at another remodel around based on the modular side?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah. I think this goes back to why we talk about flexibility in the supply chain to address that. I think when you look we are at today and you are right, it will evolve over the next 10 years, I -- who knows what will have in store then, maybe Mark does, but that will come later, 70% of that stuff doesn\u2019t sell more than one per store per week, so I don\u2019t need to flow case packs into that store for those items, you think about bike helmets, the likelihood of us selling more than one bike helmet in a week, this time a year in Minneapolis is very low.", "We may sell one and probabilistically we will sell one sometime this month, but we won\u2019t sell more than that and so that\u2019s why we go back to flexibility. There\u2019s things that are going to have to go in there in a very high speed, high-capacity, to your point we need to make sure a case pack fits on the floor or case pack in half or three case packs in the case of Tide or eight case packs or 20 case packs, because we will move that in pallet loads.", "But for the majority of what we sell much lower volumes that needs to come in in single units and so it\u2019s really about having that flexibility upstream to meet the demands of whatever it is we are doing in store and that\u2019s why we are headed down the path we are.", "Brian Cornell", "And to go on the side of the room. Oliver?", "Matt Fassler", "I am sorry, it\u2019s actually, hi, it\u2019s Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Cornell", "Hi, Matt. You guys look exactly alike.", "John Mulligan", "From here.", "Matt Fassler", "Thanks a lot for your remarks today so far. I have got a question -- I\u2019ve got a question about the level and cadence of expense growth as you move through the year, the guidance that you gave for Q1 and then for the year as a whole would imply that the expense profile improves as we move through the year. As the wage growth piece seems like it will be persistent, are there expenses that fade as you go through the year, are there cost out opportunities that build or is there topline acceleration implied in the guidance? Thanks so much.", "Cathy Smith", "Yeah. It\u2019s a little bit of, I talked about all of the tailwinds and it is a little bit of all of those things. So we will see some leverage because of the continued comp sales increase. We will see some continued cost control as we move throughout the year that we have plan. So it\u2019s kind of the combination of the four different tailwinds and none of the headwinds.", "Matt Fassler", "And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, you also shared lots of topline drivers, you talked about remodels, the new brand Shipt, free two-day shipping for a large array of goods. Can you talk about how those layer into the revenue forecast over the course of the year?", "Cathy Smith", "Well, we gave first quarter guidance, I can start, John, I guess, we gave first quarter guidance, obviously, low single-digit and we gave full year guidance low single-digit, and those all contemplate, obviously, our continued brand rollouts, as well as all of our fulfillment expansion. So those are all included in that low single, just so happen is Q1 and full-year.", "John Mulligan", "Yeah. And much of the digital, absent the two-day which is effective today.", "Cathy Smith", "Yeah.", "John Mulligan", "The Shipt and Drive Up, those the two big ones that will expand nationally our goal. You will see a pretty linear ramp up through the end of Q3 and our goal is to have all of that done ready for Q4 to redone and that will all ramp up as we go along throughout the year.", "Matt Fassler", "Thank you so much.", "Brian Cornell", "We\u2019ll go back upfront.", "John Zolidis", "Brian we got one from the webcast participants, we got somebody that said they applaud us for the CapEx that we have projects that are high returning, wondered after this wave of remodels is over, the 1000 over the next three years, what a more normalized level of CapEx might look like in the longer term?", "Brian Cornell", "I think most of you know we are not going to provide long-term guidance. We are not going to provide long-term CapEx guidance. But we are going to continue to look at different projects that add value and provide great returns for our shareholders. We will be looking in the future to think about how we continue to provide a great physical and digital experience for our guests and make the right investments that continue to add value for our shareholders. So we don\u2019t have a long-term guidance that we are going to provide today for CapEx John but we are going to continue to take the same disciplined and surgical approach to CapEx that you have seen over the last few years.", "John Zolidis", "Right.", "Brian Cornell", "Why don\u2019t we go upfront, I will give all the chance since I jump over on the floor.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for the presentation.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning.", "Oliver Chen", "The digitization of the supply chain is likely key to unlocking the asset turns. What do you think about that with respect to algorithms, as well as your relationships with vendors and as you think about robots and making sure that\u2019s on track?", "Brian Cornell", "John?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah. So all things we are working on, Oliver, you heard me talk about, we spent the last 12 months testing automation and I think five different facilities, various different forms of automation, bringing them together in different combinations in the Perth Amboy facility on the Northeast, we are starting implementation of 1 Vio of that. We are implementing something different here in DC located in Fridley, so that\u2019s a piece of it. We have a large team working on supply chain analytics, primarily located, but not exclusively located out in the Bay area, working with Mike\u2019s team to provide the technology and the analytics in combination, and again if you look at Perth Amboy, Mike\u2019s team built an entirely new warehouse management system and then there is the analytics attached to it to move how much inventory. So we are moving down the path on all of those together. It is going to take all of those to deliver what we want from a supply chain perspective.", "Brian Cornell", "And Oliver, we try to showcase obviously a lot of the initiatives today, give you a chance to interact with the team, see the work that we are doing today. What underpin so much of that is the work we\u2019re doing from a data and analytical standpoint. So our team in Sunnyvale that\u2019s supporting Mark and his team to make better assortment choices, better pricing and promotional choices. Mike\u2019s team of engineers that\u2019s driving so much of the work we are doing as we reinvent how we run our stores, how we fuel our supply chain.", "So the commitment and the investments we are making in our team go well beyond what you\u2019ve seen today and a lot of it is to make sure we have cutting-edge data analytics. We have got great engineer and computer scientists that are helping Mike and Mark and Rick make better decisions from a merchandising standpoint, a digital standpoint and a marketing standpoint, and that\u2019s certainly to fuel our business as we go forward for years to come.", "Oliver Chen", "Last question Is about value, what are your thoughts about value in terms of making sure you communicate a clear value and as we model comp store sales, should we continue to see your check size versus traffic, how do you think that will evolve and stocking versus fill up?", "Brian Cornell", "Yeah. I think one of the great highlight this year that we really didn\u2019t cover is the work that was done between Mark\u2019s merchandising team and Rick Gomez\u2019s marketing team. To make sure that as we made these investments to be price right daily. We communicated that to our guests. Both in-store from a personalize standpoint and throughout the year in our marketing and advertising campaign, and I think it was the combination of all that work that yielded the benefits that Cathy talked about today, that significant makes the $4 billion of sales from promo to every day.", "So as we go forward we will continue to remind our guests that we offer great value that we are price right daily on thousands of items across the store and I think one of the great turning points for our business this year was the balance that we brought back to advertising Target style, but also letting our guests know every single week that we were price right daily and there was great value within the store. And I think that\u2019s driving traffic. I think that played a significant part in the traffic increases we saw in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s driving basket.", "And beyond some of the numbers that we\u2019ve shared it driving an acceleration in units in those important personal and essential categories. So that commitment to value and being price right daily, we think is critically important to driving traffic, to leveraging our multi-category portfolio, and making sure people are shopping is not only for the great style brands that our teams are bringing to market, but those household essentials that bring cars in our parking lot and click store site every single week. So that commitment to value is something that you\u2019ll see throughout \u201818 and for years to come. Why don\u2019t we go to the back of the room and I will let you pick a hand because unfortunately from here we can\u2019t see. So if you can identify yourself we would really appreciate it.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi. It\u2019s Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.", "Brian Cornell", "Hi, Bob.", "Bob Drbul", "Brian and the two question I have, I guess, the first one is, as you look at the full year expectation for gross margin coming off of this holiday season. Can you just reiterate what you see from a gross margin and competitive perspective that gives you the confidence a flattish or up slightly gross margin?", "And the second question is, I think, on the free two-day shipping program, will that be fulfilled out of the stores or is that going to be fulfillment center type, can you just elaborate on that expectation going forward?", "Brian Cornell", "So when I start from a margin standpoint and as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the last few quarters. Our team has made significant progress as we have shifted our business from promo to every-day, the byproduct of that commitment to be price right daily. That\u2019s going to continue as we go forward.", "As you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of days we will continue to introduce great new owned brands in those signature categories that as we all know our higher margin and provide a great return both in-store but also to our digital business. So we will continue to see the benefits of the analytics, the science that we are placing behind, our pricing and promo strategy, the shift from promotional sales to more regular priced business, the benefits as we bring new excitement into our stores with great innovation. That\u2019s going to continue to stabilize and improve our margins over time and it\u2019s a great point of differentiation.", "So whether it\u2019s Opal House or Umbro or some of the things you saw this morning, many of the things that we will talk about over the balance of the year those higher margin home and apparel items, those great owned brands that you can only find at Target benefit not only our store margins but also our digital margins and we will continue to drive efficiency over time. John, you want to talk about fulfillment?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah. I think you will see -- next year this meeting you will see that our penetration of units delivered from stores will grow relative to 2017 and relative to two-day, absolutely, we would expect the majority of that to be delivered from store. We know that\u2019s the fastest place that can be delivered from.", "Brian Cornell", "John, can we go to the webcast.", "John Hulbert", "Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We\u2019ve got a variety of questions about Shipt, so I\u2019ll just give you all of them. One being are we getting new guests coming in because of Shipt yet. One the decision are to maintain the marketplace in other words share the marketplace with other retailers on the Shipt platform. And then, finally, the decision of why to require them versus to just become a partner on their platform?", "Brian Cornell", "John, do you want to lead this one off?", "John Mulligan", "Sure. I think, maybe I\u2019ll start with just, what are we trying to do with Shipt and then hopefully address some of those questions. We have three priorities for Shipt that we have been focused on since we close the acquisition. One is, scale Target nationally on the Shipt app and Shipt.com and we are well down that path. We are in 455 stores. We are adding markets every single week.", "The second was bring Shipt to Target.com, Mike and his team are working hard on that to provide that option for guests who come to us directly through Target.com we will provide same-day delivery service for our entire assortment.", "And then third was expand the marketplace and I guess to get out a little bit of this. We think the value here is about bringing all those retailers together. That\u2019s the value of the membership. We know consumers have different reasons they go to different retailers, often they come to Target. We really like that. Sometimes they go other places. But bringing all of those retailers together on one marketplace is incredibly powerful to bring consumers into the Shipt app and so we had great conversations with other retailers. We already have great partners and HEB and Publix and Meyer, Cosco, all on the app and we will continue to grow that. So we are very interested in continuing to grow the marketplace.", "Brian Cornell", "And to the other question, Cathy, John and I all spent quite a bit of time looking at other same-day delivery options and we invested a lot of time getting to know the Shipt organization. We were attracted to Shipt and decided to take an ownership position because of that personal connection we saw with their member.", "And as we spent time and went to Birmingham, work with some of their shoppers, saw the caliber of people that were shopping for Shipt, these moms were shopping for moms, the approach they took to really building a relationship, we felt it was so important to own that last mile touch and that human interaction that we think really differentiates Target from anyone else in that space. So we certainly had options to partner with other last mile delivery companies.", "But we thought Shipt had a very different approach. It wasn\u2019t just the transaction. It was building a relationship and we thought owning that human touch was very consistent with what we think is our greatest asset and that\u2019s our people that make such a difference as we talked to guests and they describe why they shop at Target, as I said early today, most of the answer is pretty simple, is because of our team. Okay.", "Peter Benedict", "Thanks. Peter Benedict at Baird. Two questions, first, the cost to upgrade these fulfillment centers modernization, John, you talked about, can you give a sense of maybe how much that is going to contribute to the capital spend over the next few years, what\u2019s the cadence, how many do you need to do and when do we get to the end point there?", "And the second point question would be on inventory growth. How should we think about that as you kind of clean up the backrooms, you put the fall product over the supply chain, how should we think about into our growth maybe versus sales something?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah. I think first on the capital -- Cathy has provided the capital guidance, it\u2019s all within our capital guidance, everything we have talked about we have planned for, if that changes, I am sure, Cathy will come back and let you know that changes.", "And I think pace we will know more about that actually near the end of this year than I do right now. We are very focused on getting the Perth Amboy facility up and operating and -- because that\u2019s kind of the end state. This is what great will look like.", "Simultaneous with that, like I said, we are testing how we can start to evolve the broader network into that step by step by step and what we are doing this year would be the first step and we hope to have a decision about perhaps getting to eight of those realistically probably very early next year and then expand from there.", "Meanwhile while we are doing that, go back into the local distribution center and say, okay, what\u2019s the next step we would bring to that in order to move it down the path. So that\u2019s kind of the sequence we are thinking about year-over-year. This won\u2019t happen over the next 18 months, because it can\u2019t. This is a conversation we have internally a lot.", "If we could like shutdown for nine months and not a deliver any product to stores we can get this done very quickly, but we don\u2019t have that ability. We need to keep producing product for the store. We are shipping product to the store, so it will be a gradual evolution over time, the investments will follow that gradual evolution.", "Cathy Smith", "Can I answer the inventory question real quick for you? A longer term as we talked many times, Peter. We do see that inventory loads as we move product exactly where we need it, when we need it, we will continue to come down. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a great guest experience and we are in stock and so we are going to balance that as we are evolving the supply chain so through this transition and then obviously to support all of the wonderful new brands and products we are bringing in.", "Peter Benedict", "Got it.", "Brian Cornell", "So just to build on that, it is going to take time and as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple years with the approach we have taken to a number of initiatives, we are going to test, learn, iterate and then move forward, and this is same model we took to own brands, starting with Cat & Jack, learning from that success and now we\u2019re building out the portfolio.", "The same approach we took to remodels. We started with 25 stores in LA. We continue to learn and listen and iterate and once we saw the right response from the guests and the right return on invested capital we move more quickly.", "We are doing the same thing from a DC standpoint. We are constantly learning and updating our approach and we think we\u2019ve got a model that we can expand but we are going to do that very, very carefully and make sure that we have a system that can be scaled.", "And when we get there to Wayne\u2019s question, we will see better units of measure flow into the stores, which will naturally improve inventory levels and working capital. But this is one that\u2019s going to take time. To John\u2019s point we are not shutting down our system for nine months. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear journey, but we are going to make sure that we do it right and we get the right returns and continue to provide the right experience for our guests. We have got a question upfront here.", "Greg Melich", "Hi. It\u2019s Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.", "Brian Cornell", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Melich", "So I had a follow up for Cathy and Brian another question. Cathy the $3.5 billion CapEx, that is I think about $500 million and what we are thinking before. Should we think about that, I know you are not giving long-term guidance, but does that more of a pull-forward of things that you had or more given what you see just this more stuff you want to lean into this year? And then, Brian, I had a follow-up?", "Cathy Smith", "Yeah. So consistent with our strategy, Brian, had laid out, we intend to remodel, we are seeing a great returns, 2% to 4% lift. We make sure we have great returns on invested capital with those and as we\u2019ve seen the remodels perform we are going to continue to get towards that 1000 stores that Brian talked about, but and by the time we get there is much of our fleet will be much younger in age, obviously, some of the heavier needs are earlier on, which is why the capital is little higher. But I would expect we\u2019ve done the $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion this year, obviously, we\u2019re not slowing down, we are seeing great returning and we are seeing a great response from our guests. So we are not giving long-term guidance, but you can expect that we will continue down those stores.", "Greg Melich", "Okay. And then, Brian, you talk a lot about acceleration, right. What happened last year it\u2019s now time to really accelerate it? Could you talk a little bit more about the brand acceleration? I mean, it seems like with 12 brands and 12 months and is that a new run rate, I mean, can the organization really be expected to come up with that many new great brands and ideas every year or is there certain amount that you -- or could have become 18 in a year or is there certain amount of product that you sort of limited on that ultimately where we only want to change over a quarter of the SKUs or something like that?", "Brian Cornell", "So, Greg, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be the long-term run rate. But certainly as the Mark and his team had look at the portfolio, we\u2019ve seen opportunities through replacing the existing brands that\u2019s been our portfolio, fill new white spaces and over the balance of 2018 we will continue to bring newness and innovation own brands and then we will continue to listen to the guests, understand category trends and bring great newness and innovation, whether it\u2019s with a new own brand or some of the great partnerships we will continue to bring forward on a limited time basis like we announced earlier today.", "So I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be the run rate right for Mark and his team, but we see significant opportunities to continue to strengthen our owned brand portfolio in 2018 and we will look for further opportunities in the years to come. Let\u2019s go to all the way at the back of the room.", "Bill Dreher", "Yeah. Thank you. Bill Dreher here from Susquehanna Financial Group. I have a regarding the renovations and remodels, how do you prioritize the renovations and remodels, are you working with the stores of the greatest opportunity, the older stores or how do you work on that? And then how do you -- how much of the new store remodel program can be brought in, not 100% of all the new module to be brought in, should we be expecting a similar 78% of modulars brought in and how does that rollout?", "Brian Cornell", "John, do you want to talk about the remodel strategy?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah. So it\u2019s a little bit of everything you said actually when we are choosing the stores, we have model that helps us generate age, condition, when is the last time, part of that comes into it is how hard is this store shop, how high volume is it, what is the average basket, so do they get shopped really hard day in and day out.", "And to your point, where can we have the biggest impact, where can we go and say, look these 10 stores or dozen stores we know that they are in need of it and we will have a big impact. So we go through a process. The team recommends those.", "They have conversations with the senior store leaders as well to get their local viewpoint about what\u2019s going on in that marketplace, as somebody opened up six grocery stores around us or whatever it is, and say, hey, this is one where we could really use the help competitively. So there\u2019s multiple pieces we come together with the team distills that down and then we come to a consensus about this is the list we are going to go after for this year.", "As you can imagine when you\u2019re do on the 100, that\u2019s a lot more difficult when you\u2019re doing -- then when you\u2019re doing 325, the list gets a lot more easy and a lot less contentious. So it\u2019s a great process. The team is already working on 2019 and actually thinking about 2020 us so that all happens much further in advance.", "To your question about what gets put into the remodel? Our goal is always to put in as many elements as we can in any individual store. The calibration though is we want to make sure that store can afford to have that much investment. And so lower volume stores get less and the great thing is and I\u2019ve seen this happen multiple times when we say, hey, here is we are going to draw the line on lower volume, Brian, challenges the team, go figure out a way to get these two more elements into that store. They go back. They value engineered. They find ways to do it more efficiently. Certainly as we do more scale that brings efficiency to it and so we found ways to move some of the elements we really like even into those low volume remodels.", "Brian Cornell", "So I have got a note say it\u2019s time to wrap up this session. But before we close out, I do want to thank you for joining us in Minneapolis this week. We spent a lot of time debating where to hold this meeting and really thought based on stage of our journey it was the right time to have you here, so you could see our new renovated downtown store, spend quality time with our leadership team.", "This morning we wanted to give you a sense for all of these initiatives we are working on and how there are going to help us create the target of the future, give you a glimpse into some of the things we are doing from a technology standpoint, that\u2019s going to make it easier for our guests to shop at Target and easy for our team to support that guest. And I hope today we are able to give you a sense for our excitement for 2018.", "2017 was a year of significant progress for this team. 2018 is all about acceleration. Taking all the learning that we\u2019ve gathered over the last couple of years and really stepping on the accelerator and I think we\u2019re on our way to creating long-term value for our shareholders, but most importantly, continuing to differentiate our brand and ensuring Target is one of the long-term retail winners as we move forward.", "So, thanks again for joining us, travel safely and we look forward to seeing you again later in the year.

Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 20, 2015.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.", "This morning, Brian will discuss our first quarter performance and priorities going forward then Kathee will provide insights into our first quarter results across our merchandise category and plans for the second quarter and beyond, and finally, John will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance and expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his perspective on our first quarter performance. Brian?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We're very pleased with our first quarter financial results which we announced earlier this morning. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high-end of the range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Comp sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectation. This increase was driven by a healthy balance of growth in both traffic and average ticket. First quarter digital sales increased 38% over last year driven by higher traffic and a substantial increase in conversion. Digital growth contributed 80 basis points to our comp sales increase in the first quarter.", "While we enjoyed a healthy pace of sales throughout the first quarter, we saw particularly strong results in March, as weather warmed across many parts of the country and Easter timing moved seasonal sales into the month. In April, we were thrilled with the overwhelming demand for items from our collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer, with most of the collection selling out in the first few days. We were disappointed, however, that our digital channels were not able to properly accommodate the surge in traffic at the time of the launch, and the team is working to address root causes and learn from the experience as we prepare for holiday season peak later this year.", "The first quarter saw a meaningful increase in our gross margin rate as we cycled over a promotional first quarter of 2014, and we benefited from very strong mix of sales in our signature categories this year, both in stores and online. First quarter comp sales in signature categories grew more than twice as fast as our comparable sales overall and mix in our digital channels was even stronger. Specifically, about two-thirds of our first quarter digital sales increase was driven by growth in Home and Apparel. Kathee will provide more detail on category performance in a few minutes.", "Once again, our stores did a great job controlling costs this quarter, while outside of the stores we continued to move to a leaner, more agile way of working. During the first quarter, we recorded restructuring charges related to head count reductions at our headquarters. While these reductions were very difficult for all of us, I strongly believe they were a necessary step to remove roadblocks which were preventing us from moving more quickly and responsively to the guests' needs. I want to thank the team for their perseverance during this time of significant transition. I continue to admire the energy they bring to work every single day.", "As you know, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over time, and I'm very pleased that this quarter we began returning cash through share repurchase for the first time in nearly two years. This change reflects the improving health of our U.S. business along with the cash flow benefit of our fourth quarter decision to discontinue operations in Canada.", "For several quarters now, I've been talking about the five priorities we're focused on as a leadership team: becoming a leader in delivering shopping on demand for our guests; establishing clear roles in our merchandising categories, with particular focus on growing our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness; developing capabilities to become more localized in our store experience and more personalized in our digital interaction with guests; continue to develop and test urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress; and finally, transforming the way we work to create capacity to invest appropriately in the growth initiatives I just described.", "I strongly believe if we make progress on these five priorities over the next few years, Target will deliver outstanding financial results and become an even stronger retailer. While we're at the early stages, I'm encouraged with signs of progress on these efforts. Specifically, our strong mix of first quarter sales in signature categories demonstrates the value of the work to define category roles. We continue to rollout upgraded fixtures in Apparel, Beauty, Baby and Home while investing in Wellness with programs like Made to Matter. Our buying teams are focused on delivering enhanced newness, quality, and value to our guests and we're communicating this renewed focus in both traditional and digital channels.", "Our digital sales growth of nearly 40% on top of 30% growth a year ago shows that we have a meaningful opportunity to generate comp sales growth through investments in digital channels. And following our March head count reductions at headquarters, our teams are taking a fresh look at everything we do and taking steps to remove approval layers and increase the speed of decision-making. While there will certainly be a meaningful adjustment process, I believe we will emerge with an agile and engaged team that is equipped and empowered to act quickly on behalf of the guest.", "These signs of progress are meaningful to the team and demonstrate the value of our efforts, and validate our strategic priorities. Yet, as we look ahead, we realize we're on a much longer journey and need to accomplish many more things. Specifically, we're in the very early stages of our work on localization and personalization. In the future, these efforts should benefit both sales and gross margin rate.", "And while we're still in the testing phase, we're very encouraged by the progress in evaluating and rolling out urban formats, like CityTarget and TargetExpress. We opened two new Express locations in the San Francisco market this quarter, both of which are quite different from our first location in the Minneapolis market. We expect to open six more locations this year in a variety of markets and demographic areas to continue to learn how to operate this new format in a diverse array of sizes and settings.", "Finally, we are just beginning to reinvent our food assortment and presentation. We have an opportunity to drive more traffic and sales in this critical area of the store by becoming more specialized in our assortment, more focused on healthy options in support of wellness. We're testing potential assortment and presentation options and this year we plan to study the guest response to potential changes before determining what we'll rollout more extensively next year.", "While this quarter's results are encouraging, we're focused on the work ahead of us as we transform ourselves to become a truly modern retailer and more relevant to our guests. We're taking the necessary steps, both in our investment decisions and the way we work, to position Target for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. The momentum we've seen so far makes us more confident than ever that we're moving the right direction and encourages us to move even faster. Yet we know that long-term success depends on achieving the right balance between speed and the time it takes to confirm we're making the right changes that we can execute at scale. Once we have that confirmation, we're committed to moving forward both quickly and confidently to becoming the retailer our guests want Target to be.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Kathee to recap our first quarter results and plans going forward.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Thanks, Brian. In the first quarter, we saw encouraging trends across many dimensions of our business including traffic, sales, merchandise mix, markdown rates, digital channel growth, and overall profitability. Within our sales, our results reflect our continued focus on growing signature categories. Beauty had another outstanding quarter and delivered more than a 5% comp but Apparel and Home were right behind with a mid-4% comp. Given weather trends and Easter timing, Apparel comps peaked in March but were strong throughout the quarter. Among the drivers was swim, where we saw better-than-expected results across the board in women's, men's, and kids. In ready-to-wear, we saw particular strength in Merona and our new plus-size brand, Ava & Viv. And while it's small relative to the quarter, the response to the Lilly Pulitzer partnership was the icing on the cake as more than 90% of the Apparel items sold out the first day.", "Across the rest of our assortment, food comps were just below the company average and hardlines experienced a mid-single-digit comp decline, reflecting a very tough comparison to last year when we saw particularly strong sales from Disney's Frozen and elevated promotions drove sales in electronics. As Brian mentioned, first quarter comparable sales were driven by a healthy combination of growth in both traffic and average ticket. Within average ticket, an increase in average retail was partially offset by a decline in units per transaction. This decline in average units was driven by category mix, particularly Apparel along with channel mix, as digital transactions typically have fewer units at higher average retail.", "Besides channel mix, growth in average retail was driven by a lower level of promotional activity this year and a trend in which our guests are trading up to higher quality and premium branded items. We were really pleased with the pace of digital channel sales growth this quarter and even happier that it was driven by Home and Apparel. But our digital goals are ambitious and we have a lot more work to do, so we're continuing to invest in and roll out new initiatives to maintain our momentum.", "The February launch of a lower $25 free shipping threshold drove a meaningful increase in conversion this quarter and guests continue to embrace store pickup, which was up more than 100% from a year ago.", "Subscriptions are also growing rapidly. Sales on subscription grew 32% between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and the active subscriber base grew 20% within the first quarter. And we continue to see great results from our ship-from-store capability, which delivers shipping savings for us and reduced delivery times for our guests, and we expect to roll out this capability to more than 200 additional stores this fall.", "As I mentioned in the last call, we were very happy to see the West Coast port situation resolved, yet we knew it would take a few months for the shipping backlog to be completely relieved. As of today, I am pleased to say that those delays are fully behind us. Consistent with our fourth quarter experience, the team did a great job in the first quarter working around port-related issues by pre-ordering inventory and rerouting shipments. However, despite these efforts, some categories including shoes, saw spotty in-stocks in the quarter and saw sales accelerate as receipts began to flow and in-stocks recovered.", "As we look ahead, we are working to build on our current momentum in the second quarter and beyond. In Apparel, beyond swim, we've been seeing encouraging trends in shorts, dresses, tanks, and sandals, and expect these businesses to be a key driver of second quarter sales.", "In jewelry and accessories, this morning, we announced a new limited time partnership, Eddie Borgo for Target that launches July 12. Eddie has crafted a first-of-its-kind limited edition collection of customizable jewelry, accessories, and wall art featuring the designers' signature aesthetic and on-trend colors and finishes.", "In Home, we're seeing great momentum in our tabletop business and we'll expand the offering this quarter with a broader selection of both indoor and outdoor options for summer entertaining. We're also excited (15:03) programs which will launch in July featuring more exclusive content from licensed and exclusive brands and do-it-yourself programs which will allow students to decorate their own journals, notebooks, and lockers.", "In Wellness, we continue to see amazing results from the Made to Matter collection. Since the announcement of this collection, featured brands are running up 25% to last year and the collection is on track to record $1 billion in sales this year.", "And in Kids, we have a blockbuster set of licensed programs planned for the second quarter and beyond. In stores now, we're offering about 150 items from the new Avengers movie including many that are exclusive to Target. To support the release, we've created an omni-channel marketing campaign that includes social media engagement and a uniquely creative stop-motion broadcast spot that brings the actual 12-inch action figures to life. Also this summer, looks for exclusive items across multiple categories in celebration of the June release of Jurassic World and the July release of Minions.", "On target.com, we've expanded our licensed offering by creating experiences for our top 29 licenses. Each of these experiences includes favorite items that we carry in both channels plus extended assortments that include collectibles, more apparel choices, and hard-to-find toys. We will continue to roll out experiences to more of our favorite characters throughout the year.", "To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the iconic comic strip, Peanuts, we're rolling out a summer collection of more than 100 exclusive products. These items are the work of our own product design and development team who partnered with current Peanuts cartoonist and the Charles M. Schulz Museum to design fresh, fun items that are true to the comic strip's roots. We'll roll out more exclusive items across multiple categories throughout the year leading up to the release of the new Peanuts feature film in November.", "And finally, like moviegoers, we're already excited about the December movie release from the most famous license of them all, Star Wars. Earlier this month, as part of the worldwide 'May the 4th Be With You' event, we allowed Darth Vader and Yoda to take over the target.com homepage, offering special online-only deals on Star Wars licensed product. We'll provide more details on our next earnings call but for now I can assure you that Star Wars fans will find plenty of reasons to visit our stores and target.com this year.", "As we said many times, we're encouraged by our progress but recognize that we are only at the beginning of a multi-year journey to transform our business. We continue to roll out new store fixtures to enhance the shopping experience in Apparel, Baby, Electronics, and Home, and we're working quickly to develop and test ideas to reinvent our food area to become more specialized and more clearly embrace Wellness with local products, naturals, organics, and clean labels.", "And we continue to invest in our technology and supply chain capabilities to allow our guests to shop on demand and receive products where and when they want. The good news is that even though we have much more to do, the positive guest response to what we've already accomplished makes us confident we are moving in the right direction.", "Now, I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and beyond.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance particularly in our signature categories. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high-end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 about $0.09 lower than adjusted EPS driven primarily by pre-tax restructuring costs of $103 million combined with small adjustments for breach-related expenses and the favorable resolution of income tax matters. First quarter GAAP EPS of $0.98 included a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.24 loss on Canadian operations in the first quarter 2014.", "Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 2.3% was just ahead of the guidance of 2% we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We were pleased with the sales results throughout the quarter but they were particularly strong in March as weather warmed and Easter timing moved seasonal sales into the month. Comparable sales growth for March and April combined which eliminates the effective Easter timing was stronger than we experienced in February.", "Digital channel sales increased 38% in the first quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the first quarter last year. Digital channels drove about 80 basis points of our first quarter comparable sales increase in line with our fourth quarter experience. Comparable transactions were up both in the store and digital channels accounting for approximately 90 basis points of our comp increase. REDcard penetration of 21.5% was about 110 basis points ahead of last year, in line with our expectations. This growth is faster than our fourth quarter pace and consistent with new account growth in the latter half of 2014.", "Risk levels on the portfolio continue to run at historically low levels and this quarter we saw an increase in payment rates. This increase is consistent with commentary from others and potentially explains what consumers are choosing to do with some of their savings from lower gas prices. One other note; we've now begun piloting acceptance of chip transactions at our stores as the entire U.S. payment industry prepares to move to chip technology later in the year.", "Our first quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.5% was stronger than expected, driven by an unexpectedly strong gross margin rate. Specifically, our first quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was nearly a percentage point higher than year ago. This year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we annualized the last year's promotional activity following the data breach and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature category. In fact, the last two quarters are the only two in recent history in which sales mix has been a positive contributor to our overall gross margin rate. This shows the value of our focus on driving growth in our signature category. This quarter, we grew sales and traffic while replacing promotionally-driven sales on lower margin items with higher margin sales in signature categories, and the benefit to our P&L was compelling.", "On the SG&A expense line, this quarter we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage of pay and benefits, partially offset by higher technology expense compared with the year ago. Altogether, our first quarter segment SG&A expense rate improved about 20 basis points compared with last year.", "Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter which was about 9% higher than a year ago. This increase was intentional and reflects some decisions we've discussed in the past calls. First, beginning last summer, we increased our inventory commitment in commodity categories to support in-stocks in these frequency driving businesses. And second, our receipts this quarter reflected some pre-buying of imported product that the team had undertaken to mitigate risk before the West Coast port slowdown had been resolved. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about our overall inventory level and we expect year-over-year growth to moderate in the second quarter and beyond.", "Moving to consolidated metrics. First quarter interest expense was essentially flat to last year and we've returned $333 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. As we mentioned during the last call, the improvements in our business results and cash balance have positioned us to once again return cash through share repurchase, within the limits of our capital structure goals. As a result, this quarter we bought back shares for the first time since the second quarter of 2013, investing $297 million in open market repurchases and another $265 million through an accelerated share repurchase agreement late in the quarter. This means that in the quarter we returned over 140% of our net income through dividends and share repurchase.", "Given our current cash position and continued strong cash generation by our business, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter and beyond and believe we will have the capacity to retire $2 billion or more of our shares in this fiscal year, within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. One note, we ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, meaning that if this activity continues as expected we would exhaust the current authorization later this year. As a result, we will be reviewing with our board the need to increase our share repurchase authorization at an upcoming meeting.", "Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss our decision to begin reporting after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, or ROIC, in this quarter's earnings press release. As you know from our previous discussions and the long-term performance incentives described in our proxy statement, we believe ROIC is an important metric to measure the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. Also, as you know, we presented our long-term aspirations for this metric during our Financial Community Meeting in March. Specifically, we intend to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next five years.", "Beginning this quarter, we'll report how we have performed on this metric for the most recent trailing 12 months, providing clarity on how we are measuring our own performance while allowing everyone to track our progress. To provide additional context, we're posting the last two years of quarterly calculations of this metric on our Investor Relations website in the Summary Financials section. With that backdrop, this morning we reported that for the trailing 12 months through first quarter 2015, our after-tax return on invested capital was 12.5%, up about 60 basis points from a year before, reflecting improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital in our continuing operations.", "Now let's move to our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we expect our comparable sales to increase between 2% and 2.5%, reflecting expected growth in digital channel sales in the high-30% range. Both of these expectations are similar to our first quarter performance and, while it is still early, our results through the first few weeks of the second quarter are consistent with that forecast. We expect our second quarter gross margin rate to improve about 50 basis points from last year as we benefit from the comparison to last year's promotional activity while we continue to make price investments and add quality back into our owned and exclusive brand products.", "On the SG&A expense line, we expect our second quarter rate will be 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher than a year ago as the rate benefit from productivity improvement is expected to be offset by a planned year-over-year increase in compensation expense. You'll recall that compensation expense was unusually low in the second quarter last year as we significantly reduced our accrual for full-year incentive compensation in light of softening financial performance. Combining our gross margin and expense rate expectations, we're looking for improvement in our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 basis points to 30 basis points compared with last year.", "Second quarter interest expense is expected to be about $150 million, well below last year, which was unusually high due to the retirement of some high coupon debt. Our effective tax rate is expected to be just over 35%, higher than last year's 33.7% rate, driven by improved profitability. Altogether, these expectations would lead to second quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business of $1.04 to $1.14 compared with $1.01 a year ago.", "While we've seen a strong start to the year so far, it is early and we have a lot more to accomplish as the year progresses. However, our first quarter performance validates that we are focused on the right strategic priorities to propel our business forward and it certainly adds to our confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for the year. As a result, we've taken the lower-end of our prior full year guidance up by $0.05 and now expect full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $4.50 to $4.65.", "With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee, and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question will come from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Congratulations on really solid results. We're very pleased to hear about all the progress. Regarding the comps in the back half, should we think about traffic as the main opportunity, or do you feel like ticket will also be an opportunity? And as we think about gross margin and your product assortment, how are you balancing the idea of investing in price versus the innovation that you're conducting in your signature categories?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oliver, good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As we think about the balance of the year, I would ask you to think about three important variables, and you saw those come to life in the first quarter. We're clearly focused on driving traffic to our stores and we expect that to be a very important driver of our growth over the balance of the year. But you're also seeing the benefit of our focus on signature categories and the higher ticket that that generates. But importantly, the third element is the increasingly important contribution we're seeing from our digital and online businesses. So as we go forward, we're going to continue to make sure we're seeing growth in traffic, growth in our signature categories that leads to that gross margin rate improvement we saw in first quarter and the higher ticket, but importantly the ongoing contribution of our online channel.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Brian, you've been very agile with strategic decisions around the online and digital business. As we look forward to back-to-school and holiday, are there any key pointers in terms of the strategies you're undertaking, particularly as mobile and shipping continue to be hot topics?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Oliver, you heard Kathee talk about some of the key initiatives that came to life in the first quarter, and you're going to continue to see us build off of that over the balance of the year. We've completely rebuilt our app. We're focused on improving our subscription and registry. We're leveraging our stores to ship to our guests. So we're going to continue to build on those initiatives as we go forward and continue to make sure that we're making the investments both in technology but, importantly, in the supply chain that brings that online business to life for our guests.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "And, Oliver, if we can go back for a minute to your question on thinking about price versus innovation and how do we balance those, I would just say that we start from the guests, looking at what it is that they expect from any given product category, and then how do we build the very best product which is depending on what it is, could be a combination of both price and innovation or more heavily leaning on one or the other depending on what we're talking about. But very much guest-focused to make sure that we're offering them the content that's going to inspire them and resonate. So there's not one size fits all. It's really guest-focused, driven by each category.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Congrats. And that was very clear on Lilly Pulitzer. Congrats on that as well. Best regards.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Thank you.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oliver, thank you. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. And I'll add my congrats as well. My first question is on gross margin. Does the gross margin guidance assume a continued mix shift to the signature categories that you enjoyed this quarter? And is the formula for Q2 in terms of price and quality investments, kind of, what we should be thinking going forward, i.e., you were down about 100 last year, and you recapture about half, according to your guidance. Does that seem like a reasonable formula for Q3 as well?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start with the gross margin and the focus for not only the quarter but for many years to come. And we've been very clear about the importance of focusing in on our signature categories. We believe that's our path to differentiating the brand. So you should continue to expect us to focus on building our style categories. And Kathee and her team are making great progress in Apparel and Home and Beauty and you saw the comps that those categories produced in the first quarter. We'll continue to focus on Baby and Kids and accelerate our focus on Wellness. So we believe those categories both in-store but, importantly, as we demonstrated in Q1, online, where a significant portion of our growth in the digital channel was driven by Apparel and Home. So that is a very favorable impact to mix both in-store and, importantly, as we improved and accelerate our online performance.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "The other thing I'd add, Matt, more tactically, between Q2 and Q3, that's really last year where you saw us transition from focusing on significant promotions that were primarily hardlines or some of our lower-margin categories focus to the business, back-to-school and then into the holiday season. So as we think about the way Q2 looks versus Q3, that promotional impact was real in Q2 but it was also, we had a significant mix impact because of where we focused those promotions. A little bit less of that as we go into Q3 and Q4 so the delta between last year's margin and this year's margin will change meaningfully. And as Kathee said, we continue to invest in price and quality across all of our brands.", "Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. If I could ask one follow up on the e-commerce business. I'd love to get your insights perhaps using REDcard data in terms of how much digital growth do you think at this time point is incremental, i.e., are these new customers or infrequent customers? Thanks.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "I think, Matt, I would answer it broadly and say that what we see across all guests is when they become engaged in the digital channel, we see incremental growth in that channel and, importantly, incremental growth in the stores. So their total engagement with us is very incremental, we pickup incremental sales and, importantly, incremental profitability in both channels.", "Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to get into a topic of traffic. I mean I think, traffic was up, second quarter in a row that it's been up. But I was wondering if you could maybe dig a little deeper into that, someone in the grocery space talks about loyal households and it seems to me when you think about Target, you guys want to build frequency and want to build these loyal households. How are you thinking about that? Do you measure that? Is that measure improving? Some of our research suggests some of the early things you guys are doing should be building this number but I want to get your take on it.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Yeah, I would say that, Scott, it's pretty early in our transformation to say that we see momentum in that measure as it pertains to food. I will tell you a lot of our growth in transactions is driven by new guests and that's driven more in the signature categories that we have been talking about. Now we believe that we have an opportunity there to drive traffic in food and that's why we're in the midst of putting a lot of tests out in front of our guests both product and presentation to get that business on track and to make sure that we've got a really compelling point of view for our guests and then we will measure that over time to make sure that we're making progress. But today, I would say it's more driven by the signature categories that we've highlighted.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, I mean that's actually where I was going not just food, just on the idea that I think your heavy users are up 25, 30 visits a year. Are you seeing increase in those types of loyal households? It seems to me that might be a key driver here as we go forward to get that frequency up?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Scott, it's certainly something that we're going to continue to monitor and measure over time. It's still very early for us, but that is a measure that we're clearly looking at. We absolutely want to make sure we're building loyalty. We want to build engagement and traffic. We believe our focus on signature categories brings guests back to Target looking for what's new, what's exciting. And we also want to make sure we complement that with an improved food assortment because we know food is critically important to building engagement and driving overall traffic.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "All right, perfect. And I had one other one, we obviously are in stores quite a bit and I wanted to get your take, I mean some of the pushback that we hear from investors is on the store level execution, staffing levels, in-stock position, I think people which are maybe just be a little bit better and I was wondering what you think of that and are there initiatives to kind of improve some of those measures and where do you think you are kind of what inning do you think you are in on these areas?", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Yeah, I think as we would measure that and as we look at the guest feedback that we get, Scott, I would say store execution is very high. Guests are very satisfied with the number of people that we have; their ability to help them. I would say that we have an opportunity on the in-stock side and we've been working on that collectively stores and merchandising as we work through the port situation and getting those back in stock but also just our everyday basics. And it's one of the reasons why our inventory is elevated as we talked about is that we have been making investments, particularly in essentials category to make sure that we can raise our inventory levels appropriate to be in-stock in those categories. So I think that's where we have the most opportunity right now.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Scott, that's reflected in the key initiatives we've been talking about. As we think about changes we're making in experience to elevate Apparel with mannequins to restructure our Home layouts, to begin to make changes in Electronics, we want to make sure we provide the guests with a great in-store experience particularly in those signature categories. But as Kathee just noted, we also need to make sure we're focused on the basics every day, and we need to make sure we've got very high in-stock conditions particularly in those key consumable categories. So for us, execution at store level is critically important. We believe we have the best team in retail and our focus now is on elevating the experience in those key signature areas of our store and ensuring that we're improving the in-stock conditions for basic essentials.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Perfect. Our focus group of women was really pleased, so keep up the great work. Thanks.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the support.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I think maybe for Kathee, the comment you just made to Scott Mushkin about a lot of the growth in transactions being driven by new guests, can you give us a little more insight to that? Is that a shift in traffic away from frequency and towards new guests? And how significant is that? And is there \u2013 how are you doing? Is it \u2013 are there some new marketing approaches you're taking to get people into the stores to alert them about the signature categories, et cetera? Just some color on that would be great.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Yeah, so this is something that we aim to do all the time. And of course, right now, we're comping against some pretty weak numbers post-breach last year, so certainly that's part of it. As we focus on signature categories, I do think that's getting more new guests back into the brands and in a variety of different areas because signature categories cover so much from Beauty to Home, et cetera, to the different style categories. And I think the way that we're doing it is really what Brian was just talking about, presentations that are really compelling, with product that's very inspirational, and inviting them into the store through our marketing which resonates with them and then when they get to the store or online being able to convert them to a purchase. So it's all of those things that I think are moving the needle.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And, Kathee, can you just comment more on the sort of propensity to trade-up for the guest? Is it \u2013 is there something changing there or is that just easy comparisons?", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "No, we've seen this coming for a little bit now, third quarter was the start of it, continued into fourth quarter and now, again, in our first quarter. But I think as we're improving quality, as we're stepping up our assortments to be more aspirational, we're seeing the guest really resonate with that product and move, and that's broad across virtually all of our categories. So not just in one segment of our business, but really all of them. So I think it's driven by the guest perhaps having a bit more money in their pocket. I think it's the quality that we've put in, they're recognizing those benefits, and they're wanting to be able to trade-up.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Robby, the one point I'd emphasize so that we're really clear, this isn't an either/or, it's an and. So we want to make sure we're delivering exceptional value every day on those core essentials and continuing to bring great quality, newness, innovation and value to our guests as they look for these more aspirational items. So it's not a shift in strategy and it's not an either/or, it's an and, and we've got to make sure that both elements of our strategy include a focus on core essentials and more experiential offerings and when we bring those together, that is the Target brand promise and experience. That's where we bring Expect More. Pay Less to life. So both of those elements are starting to work together and I think you're seeing the guests respond very positively to it.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sounds great. Thanks very much.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just I guess a regional question; in terms of the comp on a regional basis in the first quarter, did you see any differences in your sales trends in states that are potentially a little more dependent on oil and gas? And then I guess the follow up there is, can you also address any negative or potentially positive impact on the organization you see in areas that are increasing the minimum wage?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start with the regional performance trends, and we didn't see any correlation between what you just referred to, changes in the oil and gas industry, and an influence on our comps. Obviously, like everyone else, and this happens every single year, weather did impact regional performance. We had some challenging days in the Northeast. We faced the same ice storms that others did in the Southeast and in the Texas market. But overall, we saw very consistent comp performance across signature categories. The growth Kathee talked about was strong across the country in Apparel and Beauty and Home. And we've seen very consistent performance trends and responses from our guests across the country.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "And to the minimum wage question, no, we haven't seen those types of impacts either.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. And then just, secondly, it looks like REDcard a nice pickup it looks like on a sequential basis and year-over-year. Can you just talk about where management expectation is now on this particular product and where we think this could potentially go over the next two years or three years here? Thanks.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "It's a great question, Robby (sic) [Sean] (46:01), and I think we're sorting through that. We wanted to get through annualizing past all of last year with the breach and the impact there. We're really pleased that we saw 110 basis points of penetration growth. We're seeing new accounts grow again, roughly split equally between credit and debit. I think as we learn a little bit more here as we go through this year, we'll figure out where we want to go. We still are very energized by REDcard as a product offering. I think the opportunity for us is to tie that into a more holistic loyalty offering for our guests. We're testing some of that now out East and you'll see us as the year goes on continue to test that, take those learnings, and apply it more broadly to the loyalty for our guests.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay, that's helpful. Best of luck in Q2. Thanks.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Thanks. I had a couple questions. I wanted to make sure I understood the SG&A progression a little bit better. I think, John, in the guidance you said we would delever at 20 bps to 30 bps in the second quarter, which if I take your comp guidance, it suggests it will be up around 5% in dollar terms. Is that \u2013 are we thinking about that right? And what's the real run rate once you get through some of these other timing issues and the breaches on SG&A dollars?", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Yeah, I think, yes, you're right, and all of that increase is really incentive expense, offset by again, some productivity improvements. I think as the year progresses, we'll continue to see improvements in SG&A. As we said throughout the year, as the year progresses, we'll continue to start to see the savings that we committed to, the $2 billion, $500 million of savings this year, about half in COGS, half in SG&A. In SG&A, that'll be offset somewhat by investments in technology. So we should continue getting past the noise. As the year progresses, we'll continue to see leverage, probably similar to what you saw in Q1 as we get into Q3 and Q4.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "Okay, got that. And then, Brian, I think in your prepared discussion, you mentioned some disappointment on digital execution, particularly around the Lilly launch. Could you give us a little more detail on what's being done to address those issues in terms of how the website actually works or supply chain? Will you ultimately invest more in fulfillment center capacity? Or just some actual actions to try and address that. Thanks.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Greg, in some ways, you've answered the question for me, and we've been very clear in the fact that we're going to make a $1 billion investment in technology and supply chain to enhance those capabilities, to improve our capabilities, to make sure we're partnering up technology with the ability to provide the product effectively through our supply chain. So the Lilly event, while a sensational event for the brand, and we're really proud that we were able to create a Black Friday type event in the month of April, with hundreds and thousands of our guests lining up waiting for that product, but online we know we had some missteps, and we're doing a deep dive, we're looking at root causes and it's going to provide important learning for us as we get ready for the traffic we expect to generate during the holiday season. But we are very committed to putting our capital behind improving technology capabilities and the supply chain requirements necessary to continue to grow that business at the accelerated rates we're delivering right now.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "When do you think you'll know the things you need to get done for holiday? Is that something you'll know now or is it something to learn in the fall?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, this afternoon would be nice. But we are actively tearing apart the learning and clearly want to make sure that we have the diagnostics in place as soon as possible, and we're making the necessary adjustments and investments to enhance our overall digital experience. So this afternoon would not be soon enough, and the team has an incredible sense of urgency to ensure that we have the right capabilities so that we're constantly meeting the needs of the guests.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "And, Greg, I would just add that we're never done with that. So certainly we're learning from the Lilly event and we will put that into play as soon as possible. But as we're growing at the rate that we are and we're introducing new code all the time, we are never done. So this is an ongoing effort probably until the end of time.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "Good luck. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Couple questions. First, just on Made to Matter, just can you give us how many brands have been designated with that? What categories you're seeing being most impactful so far? And what you're doing from a marketing standpoint to support them?", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Yeah, so Made to Matter's been a fantastic program for us, Peter, as you know, we went from about 15 vendors last year and we increased that to about 30 vendors, 31 vendors this year, and we're seeing about 25% lift in sales. So the guest is really loving the product that we're offering. It's in a variety of categories. There's certainly food products but there's Beauty products, there's OTC, there's Baby. All of them, though, are really driven by simpler, better-for-you product, whether that's in food with cleaner labels and organic or whether that's in Baby where it's cotton and more natural materials, but really great results, and we marketed it most recently in the past month in what we call, the rear seasonal area of our store, where we brought all the products together for the first time and had really fantastic results. There was a marketing campaign that went along with that that really resonated with the guests, and then the in-store presence helped make it easy for them to find when they came to the stores.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Peter, I think the great part of the program is it's just another point of validation, that when we understand what the guest is looking for and we deliver the right curated assortment, they respond really well. And you know that we have over 25 million guests visit our stores every week. We know that 98% of our guests purchase natural or organic products. Thus, we need to make sure we offer them the products and the selection they're looking for. It doesn't mean that conventional products don't play a very important role going forward, but our guest has voted. We understand the guests better than ever before, and Kathee and her team are just doing a sensational job of curating the right assortment and bringing the guests what they're looking for when they shop at Target.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "That's helpful. Do you think is 30 vendors to 31 vendors a good number that you guys think you'll stick with? Do you think you'll add additional vendors to that program over the next 12 months or just maybe rotate out some and keep the number at 30 vendors, 31 vendors?", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "I think that's a pretty good number. We're still evaluating the program, it's just we launched the new vendors this spring so we're still analyzing those results. But to Brian's point, the guests will guide that work. The important part about Made to Matter is that while these brands might be carried elsewhere, we have exclusive products with meaningful innovation within the program within Target and that's what's really resonating with the guests. They recognize those brands are at Target and they love to buy them but they come looking for those new exclusive really innovative products. So I think keeping the number at a reasonable amount so that we're sure that we can drive that right innovation that's very much a partnership with us and these suppliers. So I think we're in the hunt with the right number.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, that's helpful. We've definitely seen it in the stores as well. Quick one just on the food repositioning. In terms of the cadence this year in terms of testing things, what should we be looking at? Is there going to be space allocation changes? Is it going to be just new brands? And once you do decide what you're going to do, is it going to be an early 2016 kind of rollout, something that could impact a lot of that year? Or is it something that would happen, kind of, later in 2016? Thank you.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Peter, Kathee and I have been talking about this for several months now. We're using 2015 to test and learn. Kathee has talked about key categories within food that we really think Target should stand for, and we're looking very closely at how we evolve assortment and how we merchandise those categories going forward. But this is not about how fast we make the changes. We want to make sure we really have a chance to test, learn, get the feedback from the guest, iterate, so that as we move into 2016 and beyond, we move forward with confidence. And with the confidence that the guest has guided us through the changes we're going to make. So we're clearly focused on it, the team is making very good progress, but we're in that test and learn and validate environment right now, and you should expect to see much more unfold as we get into 2016.", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "The thing that I would add is as we're going to the testing, as Brian mentioned, we're testing many different things, whether that's assortment changes that we're making, presentation changes that we're making, supply chain changes, part of our testing is to try to isolate those tests so that we can get a good read. So there's not going to be one place that you can go look at what is the new food innovation look like. We've got it all over the place. And the other thing that I would add is you know that we've just hired Anne Dament to run the Senior Vice President of Grocery, and we're very excited about that. She's been onboard now for about a month, and brings us 19 years of experience in grocery and CPG.", "So she's certainly learning and onboarding into Target and bringing a wealth of knowledge from grocery which will also impact what we put forth in terms of tests for the rest of the year. But I think you can look to 2016 as we learn and prove out what's working with the guests, what's resonating, we will start rolling those in 2016 but don't expect the big bang on January 1. To Brian's point, this is really about getting it right and delighting the guests, not moving fast.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Understood. Thanks, Kathee. Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple questions. On the gross margin line, did shipping expense at all impact you with the move to $25? And how many REDcard holders are utilizing their cards for free shipping? How do we think about that as e-commerce continues to grow?", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "So certainly shipping expense went up when we moved to $25 but I would tell you not a material impact on the quarter. And net-net, as we've said, as that brings more guests online, they shop our store, and so a net positive as far as we're concerned across the lifetime value of those guests. I don't have the actual number of REDcard holders that use free shipping on the site, but I can tell you the penetration of free shipping due to REDcard on the site is very, very high. In general, we have a very high percentage of our shipping that goes out free from the site.", "We talked about this last year when we shipped to free \u2013 switched to free shipping during the holiday season and I think that is why, going back to what Brian said, the supply chain investments we make are incredibly important for our guests because they provide speed to market from their perspective but they're incredibly important for us because they improve the economics of our online business meaningfully.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thanks. And then the second question I have is there's a lot of license initiatives that are coming over the next several quarters. When you think about the year-over-year impact on the business overall, are those gross margin accretive in terms of what they're trying to do? Would they be lower margin? And just how do we think about that as it relates to the mix and the gross margin overall?", "Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "A lot of that depends on the categories. I think the good part about licenses at Target is that our guests respond to them very broadly, so it isn't just a toy or a video game. For us, there's Apparel involved, there's back-to-school products like backpacks and notebooks. So it's a pretty \u2013 they have a pretty healthy margin mix just given the breadth of category, and most of them fall into our signature categories. So we're very excited about the lineup of licenses and the fact that they start this summer and really go all fall.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay. We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. So two quick ones. You originally guided the first quarter gross margin up 40 to 50, so I was curious what came in better versus your expectations? Was it mix or was it the level of promotions, lapping the level of promotions year-over-year? And then I have a follow up.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "It was mix is what came in better, and I think we see that in two ways. First of all, there's just the mix of selling those products and then when we see strength in Home and Apparel, of course, our sell-throughs go up, and so we have less markdowns. And so the positive benefits of mix go on and on.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'd only add, Christopher, that again, we saw that mix benefit both in-store and online. So the combination of those two channels working together clearly impacts and improves gross margin rate.", "Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. And then so the outlook \u2013 and you mentioned this going forward, the outlook in the second quarter is predicated on recapturing both of those and then going on further in the year. It's really expectation that the signature categories out-comp more the essential side?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That is certainly core to our strategy as we go forward. And I think what you saw, what we saw in Q1, very solid performance. Kathee and her team did a terrific job of curating the right products, particularly in those signature categories for our guests. Despite some of the port challenges, our supply chain teams did an outstanding job of making sure we had inventory in place for the guests.", "I was very pleased with our marketing program, and if you haven't seen the Target style campaign or some of the things we just did for Avengers, its spectacular advertising and the guests are responding to it. And our store teams just did a phenomenal job throughout the quarter despite port challenges and weather challenges of providing the guests with a good experience and it added up to really solid results in Q1. So we hope that continues. We're confident it's going to continue throughout the year, but we feel good about the progress, we know we've got a lot of work in front of us, but that combination of strong in-store and online growth in the first quarter gives us a lot of confidence that we're heading in the right direction.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, operator, that concludes our call today. I thank everybody for their participation, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Welcome to the Target Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded August 15, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our second quarter results and strategic priorities for the rest of the year and beyond. Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "We're very pleased with our second quarter financial performance. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.12 in the second quarter, near the upper end of the guidance provided in our first quarter conference call. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, up 3.4% from a year ago. This performance reflects superior execution across each of our business segments, combined with the beneficial impact of the resolution of income tax matters.", "In our U.S. Retail segment, comparable store sales increased 3.1%, marking our 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Sales were right in line with our expectation going into the quarter and right on the pace outlined in our long-range financial plan. This sales performance reflects the impact of 2 transformative initiatives designed to drive sales, traffic and loyalty in our U.S. Retail business: 5% REDcard Rewards and our store remodel program.", "These programs are at the core of a retail strategy designed to deliver convenience and value in an environment where consumers are hungry for both. They are generating sales and profits that help support our long-range financial plan in an environment where companies across many sectors are struggling to grow. These programs are designed to drive sales while putting moderate pressure on our gross margin rate, which we offset through productivity improvements and expense leverage on the incremental sales.", "We are now in the third year of our remodel program and approaching the 2-year mark since the nationwide launch of 5% Rewards. In the period since the rollout of both initiatives, the financial performance in our U.S. Retail segment demonstrates our ability to manage each of these levers effectively. We've driven billions of dollars of incremental sales while maintaining our Retail profit margins. And just as importantly, as a result of these programs, our store base is fresher and more relevant than ever, and our guests have developed a deeper loyalty to Target.", "Our Credit Card portfolio, which serves as the platform for 5% REDcard Rewards, continues to generate outstanding profitability while providing a strategic complement to our Retail segment. We expect to maintain this deep integration of our Retail and Credit Card strategies, regardless of who owns the receivables portfolio over time. John will update you on our efforts to sell the portfolio in a few minutes.", "In our Canadian segment, we're on pace to begin opening stores in spring of 2013. We've already begun renovations on 7 former Zellers stores, and we'll start work on 38 more in the third quarter. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to build technology and supply chain infrastructure and continue to build out our Canadian team. We frequently hear from our new Canadian neighbors that they can't wait for our stores to finally open, and our Target Canada team is highly focused on exceeding their expectations when we open next year.", "It's now been more than a year since we first laid out our long-range financial plan to deliver $100 billion or more in sales and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017. At that time, the U.S. unemployment rate was 9%, and most of us would have hoped and expected that it would have improved well beyond the 8.3% rate reported in July. Yet despite the sluggish recovery, our financial performance has remained strong quarter-after-quarter, and we're on track to deliver our long-term financial plan. This is a testament to our well-defined strategy and superior execution by our incredibly talented Target team, a team that is passionately committed to our guests and our brand.", "As we look ahead, we are mindful of the continued economic challenges facing many of our guests, huge deficits at the state and national level and the fiscal cliff facing everyone at the end of the year. This fall's presidential election will likely produce an avalanche of negative ads and elevate the uncertainty caused by potential policy changes that could follow the November vote. Against these pressures, we believe that our value proposition and shopping experience will deliver continued market share gains. We believe our guests will continue to be both cautious and resilient, shopping and spending at Target in disciplined ways.", "As a result, we continue to plan our business appropriately and prepare our teams to chase business when demand accelerates unexpectedly like we experienced in the first quarter. We believe this approach is the best way to balance both risk and opportunity, and our results through the first 6 months of the year demonstrates its effectiveness.", "Beyond tactics to optimize our near-term performance, we remain focused on thoughtful investment of resources to ensure we're positioned for success over time. By the end of the year, we'll have more than 1,100 of our general merchandise stores will reflect an expanded food offering, combined with other merchandise reinventions. Over the next few years, we plan to update the remaining 400 or so general merchandise locations, preserving our brand and relevance in these markets while driving incremental traffic and sales. Of course, we continue to invest in new stores in the U.S. when we find opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. We opened 6 expanded food assortment stores in the second quarter, adding 5 locations net of one store closed for relocation.", "In addition to these new expanded food assortment stores, we were very excited to open our first 3 CityTarget locations in late July in the dense urban centers of Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. We've been extremely pleased with the reception we've received from our new guests in neighborhoods around these first 3 stores, and we expect to apply what we learned to our operations throughout the U.S. and Canada over time.", "Outside the physical store environment, we're devoting meaningful resources and support of our multichannel efforts, creating a solid foundation that will drive sales across all channels over time. While sales outside our stores are a small percentage of our total sales today, we expect our multichannel investments will drive robust growth in online and mobile sales over time. At the same time, we believe these efforts will drive additional traffic and sales through our physical store base as well.", "Beyond our efforts to drive sales across channels, we are leveraging social media to partner with guests in our efforts to strengthen communities. On July 26, we launched a $5 million education giving campaign called Give With Target, in which we invited our guests via Facebook to vote for their favorite schools and earn them up to $10,000 in Target gift cards. To date, approximately 2 million votes have been received for schools across the country. There are still 3 weeks left in the campaign, and already, Give With Target has proven hugely successful in driving guest engagement.", "Looking ahead, we're excited about the compelling opportunity presented by our upcoming Canadian market launch. Last month, we announced our plan to open 125 Canadian Target stores in 2013. Launching in the Canadian market with this kind of scale requires a significant effort from our team. But importantly, this scale will drive operating leverage and financial returns that we expect to meet or exceed our investment objectives.", "I'm pleased that we're on track, both financially and operationally. And of course, we'll continue to find new ways to inspire our guests, driving traffic and sales across all our stores and digital channels. We'll deliver exciting merchandise partnerships like The Shops and our upcoming holiday collaboration with Neiman Marcus. We'll continue to develop compelling owned brands like C9 and our new home brand, Threshold. And we'll continue to explore ways to enhance our store experience through innovations in technology and service. Our guests expect Target to deliver newness, value and a great experience, and we're committed to exceeding their expectations.", "Finally, we're very pleased with this morning's announcement that we have joined other leading retailers to form the Merchant Customer Exchange or MCX, a unique and innovative effort to create a consumer-centric, secure mobile payment solution that will be connected across multiple retail environments. We've joined this one-of-a-kind effort in recognition of the significant potential we see in mobile payments and our desire to achieve a robust and cost-efficient solution. This effort in the mobile space presents a balanced market-driven approach to the future of payments.", "We are very pleased with the health of our business today and the steps we're taking to drive long-term performance. We are continually mindful of the challenges posed by the economic and competitive environment, and we're confident that we have the right strategy and team in place to continue to grow profitably.", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on second quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline initiatives for the second quarter and beyond. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. We were very pleased with both the pace and the mix of our second quarter sales. As expected, less discretionary categories like food, health and beauty continue to lead the way. These categories have been growing faster than overall sales for more than a decade. But they've become even more important in an economy where budget-conscious consumers are more consistently focused on needs than wants. Guests prefer our shopping experience. And as we enhance our assortments to include more items on their weekly shopping list, they happily choose to visit us more often.", "Our 5% Rewards loyalty program further deepens this relationship since it allows our guests to save even more off our everyday low prices. In more discretionary categories, Apparel had another great quarter with growth just short of overall sales. While strength was broad-based, performance was strongest in women's and men's apparel, along with Performance Activewear. In Hardlines, entertainment had the strongest second quarter performance, driven by growth in books. This team has done a great job driving sales by delivering a carefully edited assortment focused on the needs of our core guests. In addition, second quarter sales in this category benefited from a set of new releases that drove excitement and traffic to this area of the store.", "Electronics had another soft quarter as this category continues to reflect mature product cycles in several categories. Most notably for us is video game hardware and software, a category in which we over-index because of the demographics of our core guest. Within Home, we saw our best results in domestics and seasonal categories, with softness in our decorative categories and lawn and patio.", "As Gregg has already mentioned, we planned our business appropriately in this environment, positioning our buyers to be nimble and chase business when the opportunity arises. Given the current pace of our sales and plans going forward, we feel great about our inventory and in-stock position as we enter the fall season. We continue to find ways to control inventory growth without reducing in-stocks and hampering sales.", "Two notable examples helped to drive quarter-end inventory lower than a year ago. First, we successfully partnered with our toy vendors to move early holiday receipts out of the second quarter and into the third quarter while preserving overall profitability. Second, we've rolled out a new pharmacy receipt process, which has reduced our inventory investment while maintaining reliability. Longer-term, we continue to succeed in moving a portion of our base inventory out of our distribution centers and store backrooms and onto our sales floors. This is a huge win because it puts more of our inventory in front of our guests where they can see and buy it while enhancing the efficiency of our DCs and backrooms.", "At Target.com, we continue to make meaningful progress in improving the site experience. Since the launch of our new platform a year ago, we've been keenly focused on enhancing site stability and speed, and our guests have noticed. In our July survey, guest satisfaction with site performance had returned to prelaunch levels. And while we're very pleased with this progress, we're committed to delivering even more improvement. Prior to the holiday season, we\u2019ll implement the changes focused on the shopability of the site, namely search, navigation and speed of checkout. We believe these improvements will create a solid foundation for our site and set the stage for additional enhancements next year.", "As we expected, year-to-date online sales have been running about flat, far short of the growth we expect to see over time. As we focus on the integration of our store, online and mobile channels into a seamless guest experience, we will measure success based on total market share growth, with guests determining the optimal mix of sales between our stores, online and mobile channels.", "As you know, consumers are rapidly moving into the mobile channel, and we're happy with our results in this space. So far this year, our mobile traffic is running more than double last year, and sales are up nearly 3x. In addition, our mobile site was recently named among the top 10 best by Nielsen. And earlier this year, our iPhone app won a Webby Award for the third consecutive year.", "As we look ahead to the third quarter and the remainder of 2012, we're excited about our plans to inspire our guests while providing them unbeatable value. We're about to enter the heart of the Back-to-School, Back-to-College shopping season, and early results so far have been positive. In Back-to-School, we're focused on making it fast and easy for parents to find everything they need, all at unbeatable prices. In Back-to-College, we're rolling out fun and innovative programs like our uStyler, an online shoppable resource that allows students to design their dorm room look and share it on social media networks. Also new this year is our tongue-in-cheek college scholarship program, allowing students to enter to win a variety of fun and useful college essentials like a year's supply of ramen noodles or enough flip-flops to outfit an entire dorm floor.", "Earlier next month, we'll roll out our next installment of The Shops At Target. This installment is focused on Home and Apparel. And we've partnered with 4 distinctive boutiques to co-create exclusive collections our guests will love. Prices across the 4 collections will range from $3 to $120. In Home in October, we're very excited to launch the Nate Berkus collection, an exclusive assortment from this influential and well-respected interior designer. This collection will feature 150 home products that are stylish, inspirational and affordable, with prices ranging from $6 to $150.", "Also this quarter in Home, we'll begin to roll out our new brand, Threshold, with a small assortment of entertaining essentials, accents and decorative accessories. Our goal was to create a new brand with a clear point of view which meets our guests' expectation for style, quality and value. We expect to complete the rollout of this brand across all of our Home categories by summer 2013.", "In entertainment, we're excited about our upcoming partnership with P!nk, in which we will offer a Deluxe Edition of her highly anticipated sixth studio album, The Truth About Love, on September 18. This Target-exclusive Deluxe Edition will offer fans an additional 4 studio tracks. And in just a few days, we'll be celebrating the release of The Hunger Games on DVD and Blu-ray by offering an exclusive 3-disc version of the film as an extensive assortment of additional merchandise ranging from backpacks and lunch boxes to jewelry and pillowcases. In conjunction with the DVD release, we'll offer a set of exclusive high-end collectibles for devoted Hunger Games fans in very limited quantities exclusively on Target.com.", "As Gregg mentioned, we just opened our first 3 CityTarget locations in late July, and so far, the guest response has been outstanding. In October, we plan to open another 2 CityTargets, one each in Los Angeles and San Francisco. As a result of a unique real estate opportunity in San Francisco, we plan to open a stand-alone store, C9 Active Apparel, next to the new CityTarget location. This small space gives us an opportunity to highlight this exclusive brand in a unique way that complements San Francisco's active lifestyle.", "Pharmacy continues to be one of our fastest-growing businesses. This Sunday, we'll begin offering flu shots at all of our pharmacy locations across the country at the affordable price of $28. This year, we're offering flu shots with an intradermal needle that's 90% smaller than the traditional one. Providing flu shots is one example of the service our pharmacists can provide.", "Beyond our pharmacies, we believe service will increasingly become a point of differentiation in other merchandise areas. For example, Beauty is already one of our most profitable growth categories. Its sales have been growing faster than the total company for many years, and it generates above-average gross margin rates. Yet we believe enhanced service has the potential to elevate Beauty as a destination in our stores. As a result, we recently launched a Beauty service test in 28 Chicago area stores, in which highly trained team members will provide friendly guidance and expertise for our Beauty guests. While the test is in the early stages, if it's successful, we believe this concept could be rolled out to several hundred stores over time.", "Over the last few years in Electronics, we've increased service with our Bullseye Mobile concept, TV delivery and installation and our tech support solution, 1-877-myTGTech. Most recently, we announced a pilot partnership with Geek Squad, which we'll launch in October in 28 stores in Denver and Minneapolis. In these stores, Geek Squad will offer their full in-store and at-home installation and maintenance services in addition to a 24-hour service hotline and online support. We plan to evaluate results in these pilot stores for 6 to 8 months, after which we will determine next steps.", "And although we'll have much more to say in our next call, I wanted to briefly highlight our upcoming holiday collaboration with Neiman Marcus. The product from these designers is absolutely fantastic. And we believe this program is perfectly timed to inspire our guests, creating excitement at both Target and Neiman Marcus during the heart of the holiday season.", "We are very pleased with our results in the first half of 2012, and we're excited about our plans for the remainder of the year. We'll continue to focus on delivering fashionable, well-designed merchandise at great prices, delivering on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise.", "Now John will share his insights on our second quarter performance and outlook going forward. John?", "John J. Mulligan", "Thanks, Kathy. Six months ago, we made out a set of 2012 expectations that fully supported our long-range financial plan, and we're pleased that through the first half of this year, we've delivered performance somewhat stronger than expected.", "Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.12 is near the high end of our guidance, driven by U.S. Retail segment performance in line with our forecast and another great quarter of stronger-than-expected performance in our U.S. Credit Card segment. The difference between our second quarter adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS of $1.06 was narrower than anticipated, due primarily to a $0.03 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters.", "In our U.S. Retail segment, comparable store sales growth of 3.1% was right on plan, driven by a 0.7% increase in comparable store transactions, combined with a 2.4% increase in average ticket. Both our sales and traffic reflect the success of our remodel and 5% Rewards programs, which are helping to drive healthy levels of growth in an environment that's not providing a natural tailwind.", "Second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were consistent with both our expectations and last year's performance. As intended, our gross margin rate was below a year ago, reflecting the impact of our sales-driving initiatives, partially offset by rate improvement within categories.  Also as intended, we benefited from store productivity improvements and disciplined expense control across the enterprise, driving leverage on our SG&A expenses for the quarter. As we've said for many years, we continue to focus on driving sales while maintaining our U.S. Retail operating margins over time. And once again, our actual performance has supported that goal. Also very importantly, our stores' organization is driving meaningful productivity improvements without compromising our service or brand standards.", "Penetration of sales on our Target-branded credit and debit cards was 12.8% in the quarter, up more than 4 percentage points from a year ago. Before the launch of this loyalty program, penetration was around 5% and headed lower. In less than 2 years, we've not only reversed this trend, but today, our penetration is higher than it's ever been in our history.", "Importantly, trends at the household level have not changed. Regardless of whether guests choose a credit or debit card, we see average incremental spending of more than 50%. And in the Kansas City market, which launched this program a year earlier, penetration continues to outpace the rest of the country by hundreds of basis points. Given that the nationwide rollout has closely followed our experience in Kansas City, continued growth in that market provides all of us a clear roadmap for where nationwide penetration will likely be a year from now.", "In our U.S. Credit Card segment, we continue to benefit from outstanding underlying performance, combined with the benefit of stronger-than-expected risk metrics and corresponding reserve releases. As expected, the portfolio stayed around $5.9 billion during the quarter, down about $300 million from a year ago, reflecting the slow runoff of higher-balance Visa accounts, partially offset by new proprietary card accounts with lower balances and higher payment rates.", "Delinquency and write-off rates continue to outperform our expectations, allowing the reserve to decline faster than the receivables base. Altogether, second quarter portfolio spread to LIBOR was 9.5% or $140 million, compared with 12% or $186 million a year ago. As you recall, risks were declining even more rapidly a year ago, driving an $85 million reserve reduction in second quarter 2011 compared with a $30 million reduction this year.", "In our Canadian segment, we recorded $47 million of SG&A expenses in the second quarter, driven by investments in technology, supply chain and the team. These expenses, combined with $22 million of depreciation and amortization and $19 million of cap lease interest recorded outside the segment, drove $0.09 of EPS dilution in the quarter, $0.01 better than expected. As Gregg mentioned, the Target Canada team is on track both operationally and financially to open 125 stores in 2013.", "Our priorities for the use of capital remain the same. We intend to invest appropriately in our core businesses on projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we intend to continue growing the dividend annually as we have for 40 consecutive years. Beyond those uses, we intend to use cash to repurchase shares on a pace that preserves our current strong investment-grade credit ratings.", "While we continue to invest a significant amount of capital in our U.S. and Canada segments, we were able to return about $0.75 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter. We paid $198 million in dividends. And in June, we were pleased to announce that our board had raised the quarterly dividend 20% from $0.30 to $0.36.", "Also during the quarter, we invested $549 million in share repurchase. Through the first 6 months of the year, we have invested $1.15 billion to repurchase just over 20 million shares, an amount representing 3% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. And like many others, during the quarter, we took advantage of this low-rate environment and issued $1.5 billion of 30-year fixed-rate debt. The 4% coupon on this issue is by far the lowest we've ever paid on 30-year debt.", "Before I turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a brief update on our efforts to sell our Credit Card receivables portfolio. We have entered into discussions with several well-qualified partners, and we're pleased with their level of interest in our discussion so far. As we've said previously, we remain committed to selling these assets to the right partner on appropriate terms and believe that objective is achievable by late this fiscal year or early next year. Importantly, as Gregg mentioned, regardless of who ultimately owns the assets, we expect to maintain the deep integration that our teams have achieved in our Retail and Credit Card strategies over time.", "Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and remainder of the year. In our U.S. Retail segment, we expect to generate comparable store sales in the range of 3%, consistent with our second quarter performance. So far in August, we are on track to deliver on that expectation for the quarter. Given last year's unusually strong profit performance, we expect third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates will be down slightly from a year ago. This was our expectation as we planned the year, meaning that we continue to believe our full year Retail operating margins will be in line with last year's performance.", "In the U.S. Credit Card segment, we expect the receivables portfolio will end the third quarter about $300 million below last year or about $100 million below where we are today. We expect risk levels will begin to stabilize at historically low levels, meaning the reserve as a percent of receivables should begin to stabilize as well. This leads to an expected third quarter spread to LIBOR in the range of 7% to 8%. While this is outstanding absolute performance, we have 1 more quarter in which we'll be comparing against last year's supercharged performance driven by reserve reductions, namely a $48 million reserve release in third quarter 2011. Altogether, this means we expect segment profit dollars will be down from last year.", "In our Canada segment, expenses will continue to grow as we continue to invest in the team, technology and supply chain solutions for next year's launch. For the third quarter, we expect expenses related to our Canadian market launch will reduce EPS by approximately $0.14.", "So putting this all together, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.93 in third quarter and GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.79. And for the year, we've raised our expected range for adjusted EPS by $0.05 to $4.65 to $4.85, and we raised our GAAP EPS range by $0.10 to $4.20 to $4.40. The difference between these ranges reflects our continued expectation for $0.50 of Canada dilution for the year, offset by the benefit from the resolution of tax matters we recognized in the first 2 quarters of 2012.", "Target continues to generate consistent, strong financial performance and gain market share, even in this choppy environment. As we look ahead, we're confident in our plans and our team's ability to execute on our strategy in a variety of economic conditions.", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and confident in our plans for the rest of 2012. With a well-defined strategic plan and an unbeatable team, we expect to continue to gain market share in 2012 and beyond. That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Kathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I had 2 questions. First, Gregg, you mentioned this new merchant exchange program. Could you take it a little bit further as to what the real goal there and how big you could expect that to be as part of your tender going forward if you think out over the next few years?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, I think the release was very self-explanatory today, and we really don't want to get into too much future speculation. We're very excited about it. It's early stages. It has $1 trillion-plus in terms of the retailers that were cited in that announcement. And we really believe that the objective is to deliver a better experience, lower cost, great convenience in a very secure environment. And we'll be willing to share a lot more as time goes on.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. So then -- and Kathy, you gave us a lot of detail of what's coming. And I'd love to have a little bit more in terms of what impacted the margin this quarter. I mean, gross margin's down a little bit, but actually a nice performance, given REDcard and PFresh. I mean, can you call out some things that maybe helped the margin? Or do you think it was -- just what was sort of helping and hurting there in terms of detail?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, I would tell you it's really a continuation, Greg, of what we've been doing for quite some time. So the pressure, of course, is due to our 5% REDcard loyalty program as well as PFresh. We've continued to offset some of that by achieving rate improvements within categories. And so that's a variety of things that we've been doing for a long time. I think the biggest chunks of that for this quarter, freight helped a little bit, and our great inventory position and markdown control helped a bit, which drove us to these results.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Did you get some deflation in terms of raws in cotton and others in Apparel?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "There was a little bit. I would tell you, though, overall, really, it's just flattened out. And so we haven't seen what -- with pricing of cotton going down, there's been offsets, and labor going up and a lot of moving parts. But I would tell you it's basically flat. I think going...", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Wanted to see, now that we're getting closer to the Canada launch, how you think the assortment is shaking out and where your heaviest bets are being made there.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we are right now in the assortment planning process. I would tell you we're right in the heat of that battle. So we've been very thoughtful. We know from all of our research that the Canadians have said all along, they want the full Target retail experience. And so our goal going in is to deliver as much as -- of that experience as we possibly can. The stores are slightly smaller, so we know that there's going to have to be some editing. We have learned a lot from our 3 assortment optimization tests. We're learning a lot from CityTarget. So we think we'll be able to optimize and edit the assortment that we would typically have here. We also know that we have to customize our assortment for the local communities there. So the first round of openings is in the Greater Toronto Area. We've done a lot of research up there to make sure that we're delivering the kinds of merchandise that those guests would expect to find in their local trade area. So we've got a lot going on right now, and really, the merchandising organization is in -- is really going through all of the assortment planning process with our vendors and doing the edits, creating the planograms. And we're right in the middle of that, and we're right on track.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And for Kathy, the e-commerce, why is the comp only running flat? It seems like if the functionality is back to the prelaunch levels, we should be seeing some better performance there. And do you think it's just an ongoing lag because of the prior performance problems?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, first of all, the number I quoted was for the spring season, being flat for the spring season. And we've made progress on our platform throughout the spring season. They weren\u2019t all there from the very start. So we have had several releases this spring, and we will continue to have several more releases before we lock it down for the holiday season. So yes, they have been meaningful. The number that I quoted was our guest research that said the usability of the site is back to the level that it was pre-Everest. But we think we can and will do even better than that. And our future launches will really stay focused on those areas that I mentioned, search and findability and the checkout experience and making sure that we enhance those even further.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And for benchmarking, I would think you'd compare against other e-commerce players rather than just your overall comp, right?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Absolutely.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "And as Kathy said, the visits to the site are up dramatically. We\u2019re seeing really, really good traffic. Our speed is outstanding. Stability has been outstanding. We're still really working on the conversion. And so those are the things that Kathy is talking about in terms of the navigation and some of the things that we really want to do to make sure that once they get to the site that they get through, they find what they want faster, fewer clicks, better checkout experience. And those are the priorities going forward. But the very, very encouraging aspect is we are getting really good visitations and traffic to our sites. So they like it. There's just still a little bit of that frustration getting through and finding what they want. And we're working really hard on the search and navigation. We'll get that fixed in the near-term.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Lastly, for John, gross margins. As you lap the cotton price increases in the second half of last year, is there an opportunity for the margins to be up there? Or what are your thoughts?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes. I think, first, I'd step back to the broader picture with what I said. We expect EBITDA and EBIT margin rates down to last year, given how strong the performance was in third quarter last year. And that applies to both when you go to the next level of both gross margin rate and SG&A. So the merchant team last year, as we saw those cost increases, did an outstanding job managing our gross margin rates either through changing product or through cost increases. So we didn't see a dramatic impact last year. And so as we cycle against that, we don't expect to see that here either. I think the biggest driver of gross margin rate in third quarter will continue to be PFresh and 5% Rewards year-over-year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "First question, just on the REDcard. I think it was about a 410-basis-point increase in penetration. And you said you're continuing to see 50% incremental sales there. Is Kansas City -- you said hundreds of basis points. Is it kind of lapping and running up a similar 400 basis points? And how long would you expect that trajectory to continue? And it looks like you've kind of stepped on the marketing a little bit. Is that having any kind of an impact as well?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes. I think Kansas City is up several hundred basis points against being up several hundred basis points last year. So it is lapping against that. And it is in the same range. The range of growth there is very similar. Kansas City, we expect probably sometime next year to be -- to reach 20% penetration. And to your question about how high is high, if you'd asked us that question a year ago, we probably would have said our goal is probably in the neighborhood of 20%. And obviously, we feel pretty confident about hitting that. So I don't know where the end game is. But to your point, we're continuing to increase the marketing to our guests. And of course, it takes several times perhaps for guests to actually listen to us. But we think there continues to be a significant amount of upside to our penetration and, therefore, incremental sales and profits related to 5% Rewards.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "It's such a compelling program that word-of-mouth continues to be very strong. Our team -- our stores' team is doing a really, really great job of communicating this. 3/4 of the new apps are on the debit side, and it's immediate, it's powerful, it's 5%. There's no gimmicks. It\u2019s very simple. And it just takes a little bit of time. And once the guests figure that out, it's like, \"Wow, I get to save 5% every time I come to Target.\" So over time, they've been embracing this program, so we don't know how high, high is. We're going to continue to find innovative ways to reach our guests to communicate the value, to try new things in marketing, new things in store, to try and keep it fresh and innovative so that we can continue to build upon the penetration levels that we have today.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And are they -- is the marginal cardholder of similar credit quality characteristics and the applicant to card approval rate similar as well?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes. Actually, what has been remarkable is that the -- for the cards issued under 5% Rewards, the credit quality has been much higher than in our existing portfolio than we experienced historically. So the individuals that are drawn to that credit product, as Gregg said, it's a very compelling offer, they tend to have much higher credit quality overall.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes. And I guess, John, my question is as you're getting further and further in penetration, is there any difference between, say, the cardholder applying now versus 2 years ago?", "John J. Mulligan", "Nothing meaningful, Mark (sic) [Colin]. It continues to trend at a very high level.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. Final question, just back on dot-com. Obviously, a nice increase in traffic, and it sounds like the technology's coming. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing maybe from an assortment perspective and a pricing perspective to try to drive that conversion? Because it feels like maybe there's some opportunity there.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Yes. I would tell you the biggest part about the assortment is really making sure that what we carry in a Target store is also carried online. So these are products that guests expect us to have. There's a lot of things that we can have in extended colors or sizes online that we haven't necessarily in the past. And so we've been working really diligently through all of our different categories, with a particular focus right now in Apparel and Home to make sure that we're representing all of our store assortments online. And then where we deem it appropriate, add in different color, print and pattern, that sort of thing, before we start extending the store into new categories. So I would say great progress the team has made so far, still a lot of work to do, and we will continue on that road. And in terms of pricing, we continue to monitor our pricing against the marketplace and make what we think are the right decisions to be profitable yet competitive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.", "Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes. Gregg or Kathy, just coming back to that question about 5% loyalty program -- or 5% Reward program here in the U.S., and you think about extending that into Canada. How -- as you go into that market and you think about 5% Rewards or 5% loyalty, do you think that's enough up there, given the plethora of loyalty programs and the lower credit penetration up there? Is it going to require you to have to think outside the box of the U.S. around loyalty programs in Canada? And then I had a costing question related to that market as well.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, you're right. The Canadian market, it has far greater numbers of loyalty programs that are more established. We believe that our 5% program is going to be sufficient when you wrap it in all the other great things that come along with a Target store. So we know that it will be a little bit more challenging environment, but we really are working hard on making sure that the investment we're making in these stores and the experience that we are putting in and the product assortment and the service elements, the combination of all those things will enable us to achieve similar patterns of penetration that we've achieved here. And if we don't -- if we need to do more as time goes on, we'll look at that. But going in, we know that we're going to have to inspire the guests. It's going to be a little bit more challenging. But many of them are familiar with the REDcard Rewards in the United States because so many travel here. So there's a high familiarity of the REDcard. 30,000 of our Canadian guests already have a REDcard product in the United States. So we think it's going to be as successful there as it is here.", "Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And Kathy, I guess, when you think about costing up there, there's product categories around footwear, where it's going to be higher tariffs and so on. I mean, how do you think about that your pricing in the marketplace, given some of those tariffs? And then as they look across the border in the U.S. and see higher pricing, how do you get around that discrepancy? And do you have enough scale to where, in things like footwear, you can take advantage of that?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, the pricing definitely will be competitive to the Canadian market, Wayne, not necessarily the U.S. market. So we've already started doing a lot of pricing work up there to determine where we think the retails will fall. And then as we're getting through the assortment process, and as you said, working through the different tariffs by category and all the different costs, we will land on the right retail appropriate for that marketplace. But the work that we've done so far leads us to believe that with our sourcing team and our mix, we'll be able to do just fine in terms of being competitive and yet having our costing be reasonable. It is different than the U.S., but it's not an insurmountable challenge by any means. And I do think there's some leverage certainly from our design team here in the U.S. and how we design that product. And a lot of it -- of the Canadian designs will come from what we're choosing in the U.S. They will be manufactured specifically for Canada. But we will leverage our design team and our sourcing expertise.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Carroll with UBS.", "Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a quick one, drilling down a little bit more on REDcard. Now that the penetration rates are so high and continuing to grow, is there anything you can give us more clarity on what the mix is like within that, within those REDcard sales? I mean, does it exactly mirror the corporate averages? Or are there any categories that over-index within there?", "John J. Mulligan", "There is a -- this is John. There is a slight, slight over-index in like Food and commodities categories. But the mix impact on our gross margin rates is at a level such that it's insignificant relative to everything else going on in gross margin. So I would say, overall, the basket looks remarkably like the other baskets. And this is pure frequency, more trips driving the results. And the impact on gross margin is 98% driven by the 5% discount and maybe 2% mix impact.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Gregg, at the start of the year, you talked about a front-loaded year, where comps would be better, and you had, I guess, lower hopes for the fourth quarter. You've obviously been delivering exactly that with the 3% comp plan for the year. You've been well above that year-to-date. And it sounds like third quarter is very much in line. At least that's where it's starting. So maybe revisit that notion, how you're thinking about the fourth quarter and, given the momentum that you're seeing in the business, what, if anything, that changes how you're tackling the holiday season.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, third quarter last year was our best quarter. So this quarter, we still believe that we're solidly on track, but it will be the most challenging year-over-year. Fourth quarter, we\u2019ve just witnessed over long periods of time the competitive intensity and the willingness by others to lose money, run 70%-off sales and do things that we just think are not necessary to preserve our profitable business model. So we're going to be super competitive. We've got a great assortment lined up. We've got innovative marketing. We're really excited about our collaboration, our unprecedented collaboration with Neiman's, which will jump-start the holiday season in that post-2-day timeframe, which has become basically just another week in the fall season. So we are certainly going to go very, very aggressively to get every and capture every sale we can. But we're just not going to go into it with inventory levels that are going to put us at risk. So we're going to be just a little bit leaner, and we're going to be super aggressive, and we want to balance the sales with the profitability side of the equation.", "John J. Mulligan", "The other thing I'd add, Adrianne, relative to your question. Certainly the first part of the year has been strong for us. But as we look out into fourth quarter, if anything, there's more uncertainty now than there was when we started the year. There's the presidential election, the U.S. economy, Europe, fiscal cliff. There's plenty of things that create uncertainty for us. And to Gregg's point, we think continuing to manage the business from a conservative standpoint is appropriate for us going forward.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just following on that theme, Gregg, you talked about the inventory and conservativeness, and Kathy talked a lot about flowing the inventory better to the shelves. We've noticed that really inventory per store, the down 2% this quarter. You saw some improvement in the first quarter. A pretty nice inflection this year so far versus in the past. So maybe help us think about how you do plan to manage inventory going forward in the back half. And is there a change in the mindset and just an improvement in flowing better to the shelves?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Yes. I'll take that one, Adrianne. There were really 2 big things that helped us improve the inventory, and I spoke a little bit about that one. The first one is working with our toy vendors, where historically, we've taken a lot more of our holiday product in the second quarter, so very early in the year. And in working with them, we've been able to move that out into the third quarter while still preserving our profitability. And so we think that's a big win and will not, of course, jeopardize in-stocks one bit. The other big program is in with our pharmacy team. And that's really around a new receipt process that we have, where again it allows us to order and receive product much more efficiently and thereby not needing to carry as much inventory. So again, no impact on the guests but really enhancements to the way that we work. So those are the 2 so far. I would say as we look into the rest of the year, I think we're always looking on how do we take more product out of the backroom and out of our DCs and get it on the floor. We've done some of that this year. We will continue to see if we can do more of that because, of course, it gets it in front of the guests where they can buy it, and it makes us much more efficient in our stores and DCs. But that's a smaller effect than the first 2 that I mentioned.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just my last question. John, you mentioned the uncertainty of where we are today, higher than where we started the year. Obviously, there's been a lot of change and evolution on the competitive landscape. JCPenney clearly seems to be continuing to tweak their pricing message. And maybe help us, Gregg or John, Kathy, weigh in, in terms of where you see the competitive landscape, how it's evolved this year and the state you would expect it to evolve to in the back half.", "John J. Mulligan", "I think competitively -- we'll set aside JCPenney. I think competitively, we see it look a lot the same as it always has. Walmart continues to be aggressive on price, but they're always aggressive on price. And we've seen that in Back-to-School. As we've gone through the first opening part of Back-to-School, they've been aggressive but consistent. And we don't see them doing anything that we think is irrational from a pricing perspective. And we've seen that broadly across-the-board, very similar with the apparel retailers. So we see everything competitively actually looks very similar to us. And certainly, JCPenney is struggling. And I don't think that's having a meaningful impact on our overall business. Certainly, some areas, we're picking up some business, but nothing meaningful in the overall big picture of our business.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "The one thing that I would add, Adrianne, is that we've been picking up share in Apparel for quite some time, and we're continuing to pick up about the same. So I don't think what Penney's is doing has that much impact on us right now. I think the share pickup has just been delivering to our core guest the product that she is interested in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I guess another question on the inflation front, specifically for the holiday buy. Can you talk about where the overall costing came in year-over-year? And I guess, near-term, is there anything you're beginning to hear from your food suppliers about potential price increases, given some of the difficult weather conditions we've had across the U.S.?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Certainly. So for the fall, I would tell you the biggest -- the place that we've seen the most decreases would be in soft home, and that's offsetting the largest increases from a year ago. So we saw the most there, and we're seeing some decrease now. But I would tell you it's, call it, the low single-digit range. In Apparel, there was some slight cost decrease. But where we're seeing our sales play out has been not in -- core is strong for us, but we've seen much more strength in sort of the must-have category, better price points. And we've been seeing this over the past year. So as we move more product into that area, that affects the mix of our goods a little bit. So I think as we look at Apparel costing, we'll be down just slightly. Retail is about the same. And in Home, I think you'll see it down, perhaps, low single-digits.", "John J. Mulligan", "Sean, I'd add, too, if you look across the breadth of our categories, at any given time, there's inflationary pressures in some and deflationary pressures in others. And our merchants work really hard on where we see inflationary pressures to manage that. But across our entire business, typically, inflation has not had a meaningful impact on our business.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "And then just to come back to your final question about Food. Clearly with the drought, we expect that, that could have a negative impact on food prices. Haven't seen that yet, so I think that's probably still to come.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And then just secondly, when you look across the real estate portfolio, you guys have diversified nicely over the last couple of years here. How do you see the sales performing within the different portfolios that you have out there, the different doors? And can you talk about any cannibalization that you're having in terms of PFresh on Super Target with the enhanced food assortments and maybe how those respond after anniversary-ing the first year.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "A lot of our -- this is Gregg. A lot of our stores don\u2019t -- they're not overlapping with the other stores, so there isn't really any new cannibalization or anything. And if you look at the performance of our PFresh stores have really led the company. But our Super Target portfolio, if that's what you were referring to, is performing very well as well. So we look at all of that, there really isn't any cannibalization. The PFresh continues to meet or exceed our expectations. As a matter of fact, we just opened another 106 stores in our July cycle, and they're off to another fantastic start. So we continue to be thrilled with the performance there. And what we've typically seen, doesn't mean we see it on every store, is that we see somewhere in the 6%, 7% in year 1, year 2, we get another lift, year 3, we get a lift. But we're getting a 10% lift overall. This last cycle of stores, I mean, we're already close to that 8%, 9% right out of the block. So as we've gotten better and as time has gone on, our assortment mix is better, how we customize and reallocate assortments and space within the store has gotten better, and the earlier performance is stronger than what we saw the first round 3 years ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Question on the traffic and ticket datum. If you back out the impact of PFresh and 5% Rewards, is there any kind of meaningful difference in the trends that you see there? And then I guess, at what point do we start to see the benefit from these programs start to decelerate meaningfully?", "John J. Mulligan", "Well, I would start with -- I don't think it's meaningful to back out the 5% Rewards and PFresh data from our traffic and ticket. Those are the 2 strategies we are using to drive traffic in our stores today. So that's why we report one comp sales and traffic the way we do, so I don't think that makes sense. As far as runway here, on 5% Rewards, we talked about this a little bit earlier, John. We think there's a long runway there. We don't know how long. But we think there's significant upside, several years' worth of growth from where we are today. And similarly in PFresh, about 1/3 of our PFresh stores are in their second year, 1/3 are in their first year. We continue to put remodels in place this year. So we think we have a lot of room there as we continue to grow traffic. Those stores grow over a 3-year period. They have incremental traffic and sales. So we think there's a lot of runway left in PFresh as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "The CityTarget, it's really amazing you're able to put that into the State Street location, for example. On the assortment, a question on some of the changes you've made versus the traditional store. I saw you eliminated footwear and patio, kept automotive, however. But still very early, but how close do you feel you are on what will ultimately be the right assortment for these type of locations?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Mark, we won't make any decisions for a good couple of months here because the numbers really move around a lot. I would tell you on the whole, we feel great about the stores. The guest response has been really fantastic. But it's still so very early that we will only be working on in-stocks and getting product in there. We will not be working on changing the assortment for a few months here.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And so I recognize it's early, and you have to see whether the ROI also proves out. But as you've looked around the country, how many potential locations, if it does prove out for you, could this be for Target?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we haven't really put a pencil to that. We just believe that there are a lot of urban locations where we can't put the full prototypical store due to the real estate constraints. And more importantly, this is about adapting our format to the geography where we have the right kind of demographics to serve our guests. So give or take, we think somewhere in the neighborhood -- and this is going to be a pretty wide range because we just don't know everything at this point. It could be 75. It could be a couple hundred. But we'll know a lot more as time goes on. But we're very pleased with the start, the out-of-the-block response. We especially like the mix that we're getting early on. We're seeing very strong levels of sales in Apparel and Home, which we think are just fantastic. And that's Target's signature strength. That's the Expect More side of the brand promise. And that's really resonating in these urban markets, so we're really excited about that.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Gregg, if I could ask one\u2026", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Okay, real quick.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, on the e-commerce. I know you've been experimenting with different basket sizes for free shipping. And I was wondering if you think that's a factor in the conversion. And particularly, then when you look at the REDcard holders who have free shipping, are you seeing a lot more transactions with that group online?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "We are seeing the REDcard guests shopping online. They are our best guests, and they tend to shop us very broadly, so it's not really surprising that they would also be shopping online. And certainly with their 5% discount and free shipping, it's very appealing to them. So yes, they are very strong. We're always analyzing the basket and how much that should be before we do free ship. And I don't think that's a big part of conversion. We're about on par with our competitors with the percentage of product that is free-shipped through various promotions. I think more of our strategy is really focused on making sure that our site is very shoppable, that the search capability is great, that the way guests navigate and their ability to click through in the fewest amount of steps to be able to purchase is the most important thing to improving our results.", "Gregg W.

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen only mode.  Afterwards you will be invited to participant in you will be invited to participant in a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  As a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  As a reminder this call is being recorded Wednesday May 20, 2009.  I would now like to turn the call over to Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "Welcome to our 2009 first quarter earnings conference call.  This morning I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our strategy and outlook for 2009 and describe the current status of our proxy contest with Pershing Square.  Then, Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President Merchandising will discuss key initiatives underway that are already benefitting our business as evidenced by our first quarter results as well as initiatives planned for implementation in the coming months.  ", "Next, Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review our first quarter financial results and describe our expectations for the second quarter and the back half of the year.  Finally, we will open the phone lines for a question and answer session.  As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via webcast.", "Following this conference call John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow up questions you may have.  Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.  ", "Most of our comments this morning will be focused on our first quarter results, the initiatives within our business and our outlook for the second quarter but, first I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the proxy contest initiated by Pershing Square to replace the four current directors of our board who terms expire at our annual meeting of shareholders next week.  We firmly believe that Target\u2019s four director nominees: Mary Dillon; Dick Kovacevich; George Tamke; and Sol Trujillo have significant leadership experience that is highly relevant to delivering continued profitable growth and generating significant shareholder value over time.", "Together with the other eight board members we believe these directors and Target\u2019s management team have developed and successfully executed a strategy focused on continuous innovation, outstanding value and a superior guest experience that has produced strong financial results and made Target one of the best retailers in the United States.  We strongly maintain that our current board including these four nominees is the right board with the strength, diversity, experience and qualifications to provide continued, effective, independent oversight and direction to the company.", "Our board is fully engaged with management in driving Target\u2019s overall strategy and ensuring that our shopping experiences both deliberately differentiated from our primary competitors and embraced by our guests even as their preferences evolve.  Since the implementation of our expect more pay less brand promise nearly two decades ago our differentiated strategy with this intense focus on outstanding value, outstanding design and refreshing affordability has delivered meaningful value for our shareholders.", "As we look to the future, we have a number of initiatives under way, some of which you\u2019ll hear about today that we believe will contribute to continued growth in revenue and profitability.  We are keenly focused on remaining relevant to our guests and be differentiated from Wal-Mart and others.  We believe that Target is well positioned to continue gaining profitable market share and we expect that Target will continue to outperform relative to our industry peers just as we have historically.", "We are confident in our slate of independent, experienced nominees and the strategy they have helped to shape and we firmly believe that the replacement of any of the four current directors would diminish the strength and talent of our board and impair its ability to continue to generate lasting and substantial value for all of our shareholders.  In contract, we believe Pershing Square has presented a risky and speculative real estate proposal, has made claims about Target\u2019s food and credit card businesses that clearly reflect a lack of understanding of our strategy and have nominated a slate of directors who have openly acknowledge that they have no definitive plan to create value for Target shareholders over time.", "For example, Pershing Square points to the fact that the mix of food in our assortment is much lower than Wal-Mart\u2019s.  This misses the point that Target\u2019s differentiated assortment is a key aspect of our strategy that has created so much value over time.  Pershing Square also criticizes us for not selling our credit card portfolio at some unspecified point in the past.  This criticism conveniently ignores the fact that Target earned nearly $2.4 billion in credit card segment profits from 2004 through 2008 and that Target would have had to give away a meaningful portion of those profits had it sold the portfolio during that period.", "While it is a fact that our credit card segment processing fell sharply in 2008 this decline was due in part to paying JP Morgan Chase for the credit risk they agreed to bear in our May 2008 transaction.  It is also a fact that no bank was willing to pay us more than we earned during this period for the privilege of controlling or owning this portfolio.  In summary, we believe there was no executable transaction that would have created more shareholder value than the course of action we chose.", "We believe Pershing Square as attempted to divert attention from their real agenda with distractions related to the size of the Target board, the integrity of the board nomination process, the quality of the site of our annual shareholder\u2019s meeting and the suggestion of a universal proxy card.  I\u2019d like to briefly address each of these issues.  We firmly believe that the board properly consisted of 12 directors at the time of Bob Ulrich\u2019s retirement at the end of January.", "However, in order to avoid expensive and distracting arbitration we have elected to allow shareholders to determine our board size by including a proposal in our proxy.  Target has a formal and consistent process for screening and recommending new director candidates.  Despite being well beyond the board\u2019s publically disclosed deadline of December 31st for the submission of nominees, the nominating committee comprised of only independent directors gave full and fair consideration to Pershing Square\u2019s first two candidates.", "Pershing Square did not suggest Mr. Ashner and Mr. Vague until two business days prior to the nominating committee\u2019s decision and never suggested Mr. Donald or Mr. Gilson for consideration.  Since 2006, Target has held its annual meeting for shareholders in a newly constructed brand rite Target store scheduled for opening in our July store opening cycle.  Each of these stores have been in great condition at the time of the meeting and we expect this year to be no different.", "Five weeks after they launched their content and on the very day we filed our definitive proxy materials and without any advanced communication to Target, Pershing Square suggested the use of a universal proxy card for this contest.  [Broad Ridge] has confirmed that it would have to make significant changes to its electronic voting system that would take a substantial amount of time to implement making automated voting on the universal proxy card unfeasible in the timeframe of this proxy contest.", "In recent weeks we have received strong support for our strategy and our board from many of our shareholders and we are very pleased with yesterday\u2019s recommendation by Glass Lewis that shareholders support all of our independent and highly qualified director nominees.  Their recommendation reinforces our strong belief that Target\u2019s board and management are executing the right strategy for sustaining Target\u2019s competitive advantage and driving continued profitable growth.", "In contrast we believe that RiskMetric reached the wrong conclusion and one that is clearly inconsistent with its own policies.  These policies provide that the dissident first has the burden of proving that change to the board is warranted and then must prove that its nominees are likely to effect positive change if elected.  We do not believe that Pershing Square met either of these tests and we believe that unfortunately RiskMetric\u2019s analysis includes numerous statements and comparisons that are inaccurate or misleading.  In our opinion, the report is fundamentally flawed and should be viewed critically by investors.  ", "We have a long history of being open with and accessible to our shareholders and we have been consistent and transparent with our relationship with Pershing Square from the beginning.  We simply to not believe that the election of any of the Pershing Square nominees would enhance the creation of shareholder value or be in the best interest of our shareholders.  ", "Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to Target\u2019s strategy and performance during the first quarter of 2009.  We are very pleased with our first quarter earnings results release this morning.  We are seeing encouraging signs of stability in the operating results of both our retail and credit segments.  Satisfaction among our guests continues to be among the highest in the industry with guest survey scores continuing to trend upward.  Broadly speaking, economic conditions appear to be stabilizing somewhat and we believe this will prompt greater discretionary spending in the months ahead.  ", "We continue to plan conservatively however as key economic indicators like unemployment, fuel prices, bankruptcies and home foreclosures remain uncertain.  The actions we have taken during this challenging economic period balancing offense and defense as we focus on remaining relevant to our guests over the long term are driving sales and profitability and helping us sustain our competitive advantage.", "Our intensified focus on food including the test of our new expanded food format is positioning us to drive frequency in sales as we continue to evolve our assortment to satisfy our guests needs and their desire for a convenient one-stop shopping destination.  A consolidation of our owned brand portfolio including the relaunch of our Target brand health items and household essentials will improve profitability and price perception.  Our new broadcast campaign conveys the connection our guests feel towards expect more and pay less and talks to them in an authentic Target voice that we believe will attract savvy price sensitive consumers who want great value and an outstanding shopping experience.  Kathy will discuss each of these in greater detail in a few moments.", "We also continue to successfully pursue thoughtful meaningful expense management and productivity improvements as well as disciplined inventory management which are allowing us to maintain our unwavering brand standard while delivering profitable results.  While Doug will talk more about our credit card segment shortly, I\u2019m pleased with the improvements we\u2019re seeing in this business following aggressive action taken last year to manage credit granting and underwriting early stage delinquencies have declined in each of the last three months, write offs are in line with our expectations, our assessment of the portfolio\u2019s risk led to a slight reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the first quarter and, unlike many other credit card issuers our portfolio in the quarter was profitable.", "We believe all of these initiatives are consistent with our long term strategy of creating shareholder value overtime and position us to succeed in any economic environment.  Now, Kathy will talk about initiatives that are driving our business today as well as initiatives that will be implemented in the coming months.", "Kathryn A. Tesija ", "We are already seeing evidence that many of our new initiatives are benefitting our business and we are optimistic that initiatives we plan to implement later in the year will also drive favorable results.  These efforts demonstrate that Target is not being complacent, that we are aggressively pursuing opportunities to delight our guests and to enhance our sales and profitability.  Our continuing brand research which I\u2019ll discuss more in a few minutes shows that our expect more pay less brand promise is more relevant than ever.", "While we continue to deliver the differentiation our guests have come to expect, we are also aggressively delivering the value she demands.  Our merchandising and marketing efforts are keenly focused on letting her know that we understand her needs and we are uniquely positioned to help.  Our commitment to deliver an exceptional, affordable, everyday shopping experience combined with our drive for speed, innovation and execution are helping us drive traffic, generate profitable sales and satisfy loyal Target guests while attracting new guests to our stores.", "While Target continues to experience shifts in spending due to the economy, our guest research shows both very favorable signs of guest affinity for our brand and indications of some rebounding of consumer confidence.  Satisfaction among Target guests continues to be among the highest in the industry and more than 50% of guest\u2019s rate us as one of their favorite places to shop.  We lead our competition on measures of emotional engagement, shopping experience and guest service.  ", "Store performance scores and guest satisfaction scores continue their upward trends and are at all time highs affirming that our thoughtful expense management has not negatively impacted the guest experience.  Upholding these standards is very important because the Target guest has high expectations.  She tends to be more affluent, associates Target strongly with discretionary merchandise and therefore makes more discretionary trips to our stores.  In this economy, most of the trips we are losing are discretionary trips from our highest income guests who have the most trips to give up.  These guests still rate Target very high on satisfaction compared to other retailers, they simply have cut back on some of their discretionary trips.", "Target continues to gain new guests in the first quarter, just as we did throughout all of 2008.  While guests strongly associate Target with discretionary merchandise, their satisfaction and loyalty combined with our strategies to improve their association with non-discretionary items will position us to continue to gain profitable market share in to the future.  We\u2019re pleased that our guests are so satisfied with their shopping experience at Target and part of that satisfaction is having the product that they need when they need them.", "Our conservative management of inventory flow is helping us manage through this challenging sales environment while delivering supply chain efficiency and superior management of in stock levels.  We\u2019ve been using store and merchandise segmentation to determine optimal assortments and inventory levels based on store sales volume, geography and demographic.  In addition to driving sales, this strategy reduces store labor and clearance markdowns and improves in stock reliability.  ", "We exited the first quarter with inventories in very good conditions which has contributed to favorable markdown rates, margin performance and overall profitability.  Within our merchandise assortment, discretionary categories continue to be challenged but some discretionary categories performed better than average in the first quarter including newborn, infant, toddler apparel, intimate, hosiery, performance wear and toys.  Non-discretionary categories enjoyed continued comparable store sales growth with the strongest performance n healthcare and beauty, food and household essentials.", "Our research indicates that guests are sticking more closely to their shopping lists and additionally we have observed the following guest purchasing behaviors.  Within some merchandise categories guests are shifting from best to better products in to goods such as buying less organic produce or salon hair care.  However, certain best items such as C9 by Champion, Fieldcrest and Dwell Studio continue to perform stronger than their respective categories as guests either save for the features and benefits they really want or shop at Target instead of department and specialty stores.", "Guests are switching from services they use to purchase to products that allow them to perform those services at home such as buying nail polish or hair color instead of going to the salon and buying single serve coffee makers instead of going to the coffee shop.  Rather than buying complete outfits guests are buying a single piece like a top and some accessories to go with it.  Sales of popcorn poppers and microwave poppers are very strong as guests recreate the theater experience at home.  ", "Food is increasingly a key focus in our efforts to increase shopping frequency.  Our mix of discretionary and non-discretionary offerings has allowed our guests to do more in one store for quite some time and our evolution in food with our new fresh format will provide our guests with even greater convenience.  This new format offers an enhance food assortment with expanded dry, dairy and frozen foods and high frequency perishables.  This new format has been driving additional fill in grocery trips and generating incremental sales across the entire store.", "We will continue to test this new format throughout 2009, rolling it out to more than 40 new stores and about 60 remodeled stores for a total of more than 100 stores by year end.  If the format continues to deliver the favorable results we have been experiencing, we plan to offer the format in most of our new and remodeled stores over the next three years.  We\u2019ve also been leveraging the strength and growth of our owned brands making great progress on our owned brand strategy.  ", "Our goal is to consolidated and extend Target\u2019s owned brand to create fewer brands with greater visibility and consistently across our merchandise assortment.  The breadth, depth, innovation and price of these brands deliver exceptional value for our guests while improving our margins.  Target brand, our exclusive line of health, beauty and household essentials has been a very popular brand with our guests for many years.  Over the past five years sales of this brand have grown at a compound annual rate of 25%.  ", "To position the brand for continued growth and profitability, we are relaunching Target brand as up and up with product quality, packaging and marketing that our representative of the national brand equivalent.  This relaunch which is already under way allows us to create a new and more powerful brand identity for this assortment.  The roll out began with sun care in March and will include products spanning 40 categories when our marketing push begins later this summer.  ", "While up and up enhanced packaging and design help us deliver on the expect more side of our brand promise, the brand definitely helps our guests pay less.  On average, up and up products present a savings of about 30% when compared to their national brand equivalents.  Because margin is generally higher on owned brands, we\u2019re able to increase our profitability by thoughtfully growing and evolving our owned brand portfolio.  ", "When it comes to paying less, we know that value is more than price, it\u2019s a combination of quality, design and affordability.  We recognize however, that price continues to be of critical importance in our guest\u2019s shopping decisions.  Our goal is to stand for exceptional, affordable, everyday shopping and our efforts around price and price perception are helping us better convey how affordable and competitive a Target shopping trip really is.  We don\u2019t ever want price to be a barrier to shopping at Target.", "For this reason, we\u2019ve been testing a low price promise in Target stores in the Denver and Orlando markets and in select Minneapolis stores.  The policy allows these stores to match advertised prices from competitors on identical items in local markets and assures guests that our products are priced right.  It\u2019s still too early to gage the impact of this test but so far guests have requested very few price adjustments.", "I mentioned that we\u2019ve conducted research that demonstrates the continued power and relevance of our expect more pay less brand promise.  However, we discovered and opportunity to tie our brand promise more closely to Target and speak to our guests in a more authentic voice.  Our new broadcast campaign reflects real moms.  This more direct and genuine approach to broadcast marketing shows moms telling personal stories about Target\u2019s great store experience and prices.  This evolved tone and voice will strengthen the emotional bond we have with our guests while our circulars will continue to feature fewer items, more groceries and trip driving commodities and a stronger emphasis on price and value.  ", "While discretionary categories have been the hardest hit in this economy, they remain extremely important for our guests and our business.  We will continue to provide newness and a compelling reason to shop at Target, offering as many or more designers in the first quarter and throughout spring as we did during the same time frame last year demonstrating our continued commitment to differentiated content.  ", "Last month, for Earth Week we launched two popular sustainable lines MIO for Target which featured outdoor living products and Loomstate in apparel.  Also in apparel the latest Go International collection by Tracy Feith hit stores and Target.com earlier this week.  This vintage inspired yet fresh design continue our ongoing commitment to delighting our guests with fresh and emerging designers.  Our second designer collaboration with world renowned fashion icon Anna Sui will be available in stores and on Target.com for five weeks starting in mid September.  ", "Sui attended Parsons School of Design in New York, served as a stylist for acclaimed fashion photographer Steven Meisel and designed for several companies before launching her first collection in 1980.  We are thrilled to offer her vibrant, pop cultured inspired collection with its vintage influences and sophisticated nuances to our guests at a great value.  ", "A limited time only program in jewelry and accessories continues to deliver newness and contribute to the unique shopping experience.  In August, we\u2019re looking forward to the Anna Sheffield collection.  This collection consists of 45 different styles that are fun and flirty and offers sterling silver keepsakes including a range of delicate drop and playful stud earnings and charm necklaces with multiple chains and rings. ", "We will continue to drive sales with our plans for secondary spring and summer seasonal events as well as the key back to school and back to college season.  In June we will release the limited edition Dror for target collection which includes more than 30 items in bedding, home accessories and stationary from designer Dror Benshetrit.  His products are intuitive and easy to use designs, they\u2019re enhanced by whimsical patterns, rich colors and unique shape.  The collection includes multifunctional and transformative items such as a bookcase that can be used in many different configurations, reversible bedding and a mirror that can hang on a wall or stand on a desk.", "We\u2019ll drive traffic during these key seasons through our circular, direct mail incentives and for back to college a much more aggressive and social and online media mix.  We\u2019ll speak to mom and her need to provide what her kids want but on her budget while speaking to students in a way that resonates with them.  ", "As part of our continued commitment to multichannel integration, Target.com will completely reinvent our music, movies, books and video game offerings starting in August.  Target.com will be revamped to include trailers, audio clips, book reviews and suggestions making it a completely new experience for our guests.  ", "We are committed to maintaining our innovative edge in the current economy by continuing to focus on the critical areas of frequency, value and differentiation by improving guest satisfaction and attracting new guests.  We look forward to continuing to find new ways for our guests to depend on us to meet the needs of her household.  Now, Doug will discuss our financial performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter of 2009.", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "In my remarks today I plan to discuss the drivers of our performance in each of our two business segments in the quarter and I\u2019ll also provide an outlook for our cash flow and earnings for the remainder of the year.  At the time of our earnings call about 90 days ago we had just ended a quarter in which weak and volatile economic conditions created unique challenges in both of our business segments.  In our retail segment we had just finished a period in which our sales results were much harder to predict whether by day or across geography or across merchandise categories than had been true in the past.", "You\u2019ll now doubt also recall that our fourth quarter same store sales were weaker than in any other quarter in modern history.  Yet, there were some modest positive signs as we entered 2009, our inventory levels were exceptionally cleaned, our planned quantities of fresh fashion merchandise were appropriately conservative, January sales had been better than the holiday season and our daily sales volatility had begun to moderate yet, a lot of uncertainty remains particularly about the overall economic environment that we might be facing going forward.", "Against that backdrop, our first quarter retail profit measured in EBITDA or EBIT, whether in dollars or expressed as a percent of sales turned out to be much better than our expectation at that time.  These results were driven by slightly better than expected sales and by much better than expected gross margin and expense performance.  Focusing first on our sales, total results were up slightly and same store results were down 3.7%.  Same store sales in turn were driven by a decline in transactions of a little more than 1% with the remainder due to a decline in average transaction size measured in dollars.", "Further decomposing the drivers of an average transaction, the average number of items in each transaction declined more than 3% from a year ago which was partially offset by about a 1% increase in the average selling price per item.  Turning next to generation of gross margin, as expected we experienced pressure on gross margin rate due to stronger sales growth in our lower margin traffic driving businesses than our pace of sales in our higher margin business.  In isolation this depressed gross margin rate by about 80 basis points essentially all of which was offset by better gross margin rates across most merchandise categories in the store.", "This was driven in part from favorable markdown performance due to clean inventories and disciplined control over the flow of receipts of markdowns sensitive goods and in part by improved markup in many categories as well.  Our supply chain costs recorded in cost of sales also contributed favorably in the quarter.  Separately, our retail segment EBIT also benefitted from continued strong expense performance in the first quarter.  Our stores organization continues to drive meaningful improvements in productivity while maintaining our brand standards for staying in stock and providing friendly service and fast check out in our stores.", "In addition, we enjoyed the benefit in the period of yet another favorable adjustment to our workers\u2019 compensation accruals reflecting improvements in team member\u2019s safety in both our stores and in our distribution centers.  Year-over-year we also benefited in the period from changes in the timing of some expense items.  For example, timing of our marketing programs this year benefitted the first quarter and will create a headwind in the second quarter.  On balance though the majority of our year-over-year expense rate improvements reflects sustainable operating discipline that we\u2019ve been able to achieve in this challenging economic consumer environment.", "Turning to our credit card segment, we experienced results in the quarter that were fully consistent with the expectations laid out 90 days ago.  Notably the portfolio delivered profitability that while modest by our historical standards, continued to lead the way among benchmark card issuers.  Annualized revenue yield of 21.7% of average receivables was about 200 basis points lower than the yield in last year\u2019s first quarter due primarily to a lower prime interest rate.  ", "Other matters affecting revenue yield such as the benefit of prior changes in terms essentially offset the impact of lower late fee income among others.  Most importantly, net write offs were right on our previous expectations and we continued to enjoy much better early stage delinquency metrics than just 90 days ago.  This is a very welcome development regarding likely future write offs.  More about our outlook in a few minutes.", "Operating and marketing expense performance in this segment favorably leveraged as well.  Our overall managed portfolio delivered a 250 basis point spread to LIBOR in the quarter.  While this was well below our very strong first quarter performance last year, it\u2019s way ahead of current year results of the large competitive card issuers most of whom recently reported first quarter 2009 losses in their comparable credit card segments.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn to our expectation for the generation and use of cash in our operations.  In February I said that we expected to generate in excess of $4 billion in cash flow from operations this year and if achieved this would be more than ample to fund all our needs including expected capital expenditures of just over $2 billion, debt maturities of $1.3 billion and dividends on our common shares of about $500 million, all without the need to access the term debt capital markets.  This guidance remains sound today.", "Again, we might choose to opportunistically enter the debt capital markets in 2009 but our liquidity and cash flow provide us the luxury to be able to be very picky about the timing and approach to these markets if we approach them at all.  Our new store and capital investment plans have not changed since we last described them to you.  We\u2019ll decide sometime in the next six months whether and to what extent we might elect to commit to additional new stores in our final round of openings in October of 2010.  We\u2019ll also decide sometime in the next six months how fast to plan the potential 2010 roll out of an expanded food assortment including perishables in our general merchandise stores as well.  When made, these decisions would have more to do with our 2010 capital investment and cash flow than with our outlook for 2009.  ", "Now, let\u2019s turn to our P&L expectations for the rest of this year.  In our retail segment we continue to focus on driving traffic to our stores, a portion of which reliably converts to sales of our higher margin merchandise even in this environment.  Nevertheless, in the short term we continue to expect to produce overall low to mid single digit percentage declines in same store sales and we expect to continue to mitigate some of the potential adverse impacts of our sales mix and of deleveraging expenses by thoughtful creative and disciplined practices throughout our enterprise. ", "In fairness though, we\u2019re not likely to repeat in the second quarter the extraordinary year-over-year margin performance we enjoyed in this segment in the first quarter.  Looking beyond the next quarter, most likely by the fourth quarter, we would expect to surpass last year\u2019s performance in same store sales and in generation of EBIT and EBITDA.  ", "Looking forward in our credit card segment, we continue to favor reducing our near term risks at the likely cost of causing somewhat smaller portfolio of receivables than otherwise could have been the case.  We continue to expect net write offs to remain stable in the second quarter at a level near our first quarter experience of approximately $300 million.  While we\u2019re very cautious about making bold predictions about the third and fourth quarters on this metric, we think it is unlikely that net write offs would increase from this current experience.  ", "While our internal portfolio metrics are improving we temper the magnitude of our enthusiasm based on the external or macro environment including the likely future path of unemployment statistics.  In summary, at the moment the medium first call estimates for Target envision EPS of $0.63 in the second quarter and $1.46 for the second half of this year.  Today, from our point of view, these seem achievable but until and unless we begin to enjoy a better pace of sales it will also remain challenging to meet or exceed these estimates.", "Now, Gregg has a few concluding remarks before we move on to the Q&A.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "As you\u2019ve heard this morning, Target remains focused on delivering continuous innovation and outstanding value.  We are encouraged by the positive signs we are observing in both our retail and credit card segments and we are actively pursuing initiatives to capitalize on opportunities in the market place that leverage our brand and fuel our continued profitable growth.  We remain committed to delivering a shopping experience that resonates with our guests, that sustains our competitive advantage and that creates substantial value for our shareholders over time.", "Before we take your questions, I want to publically congratulate Doug for his recent ranking by Institutional Investor as the top CFO within our category.  Those of you who know Doug will certainly agree that this honor is well deserved.  That concludes our prepared remarks now, Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Gregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Could you get in to a little bit more Doug in terms of SG&A?  I know that there were a few things that helped that you said were timing related, should we still be thinking that SG&A dollars this year could grow maybe 2% or 3% or is it possible to keep it actually flat or even slightly down?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "That\u2019s a great question and it depends heavily on the pace of sales.  I think it\u2019s still good advice to think we will favorably leverage SG&A for the year at say 1% or so same store sales performance and deleverage to the extent that same store sales are below that.  So, it really has a great deal to do with our pace of same store sales.", "Gregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Then on the gross margin side, the mix hit about 80 bips, if I remember correctly that\u2019s a little bit more than its actually been running, is that just straight because of comps or did some of the mix actually change within the categories that hurt that?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "It\u2019s comps across the categories and it\u2019s a little worse but we\u2019re talking about a handful of basis points compared to some of our most recent experience.  For the year last year it was 60 but, there were periods that were obviously more than 60 during the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Charles Grom \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Charles Grom \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just to follow up on that last question, just on the timing of certain expenses Doug, can you just share with us in either dollar amount, percentage or basis points how much it is going to shift back in to 2Q?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "The single biggest timing issue for us I mentioned in my remarks which is marketing and advertising expense give or take benefited Q1 by about 30 basis points.  Some of that meaningful part of that will turn around in Q2.", "Charles Grom \u2013 JP Morgan", "That\u2019s basically the only timing expense during the quarter?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "There are always a big list of timing issues but, generally speaking they obviously cancel out across the year.  In the quarter we had other issues of a timing nature that ran both ways but, that one rises far above the rest.", "Charles Grom \u2013 JP Morgan", "Then Gregg, just on the top line you referenced stability and I don\u2019t recall you saying that in the past few conference calls.  Could you talk to maybe the magnitude of how much the day-to-day volatility of sales is compressed?  And also, any trends in the California and Florida markets?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "By stability we\u2019re referring to the fact that our same store sales have been consistently in the mid single digit decline range.  But, we are also seeing that the sales pattern variability either within category or between the categories are less than they had been in the past, the daily sales variability are less volatile than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past and the geographic variability has been less volatile than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.  Some of the hardest hit states are still underperforming the average of the chain but they are not nearly as negative as they were in 2008 and in particular the third and fourth quarter.  ", "Charles Grom \u2013 JP Morgan", "Then one for Kathy, just Pennys and Kohls have both talked to sourcing costs down anywhere from 3% to 10% in the back half of \u201909 and even more so in 2010.  I\u2019m just wondering, I know you guys have a little bit of a different sourcing by region, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s a decent ballpark for you and a little bit of sense of how you think that could support gross profit margins in the back half of the year?", "Kathryn A. Tesija ", "I would say that\u2019s within the range of what we expect.  I would guess probably more like 5%, to 7% or 8%.  We\u2019ve seen some of that already this year but we believe it will grow as we move through the quarters here.  In terms of how that translates to gross profit, I think a lot of that will be reinvested in pricing to make sure that we\u2019re offering the best value to our guest.  So, at this point it\u2019s hard for me to tell you exactly what I think will flow through but I would say that most of that is going to be reinvested in the product.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "I would agree, we expect these same kinds of price decrease that we\u2019re experiencing, other retailers are going to get the same kind of pricing decrease so it\u2019s really about making sure that we\u2019re competitive, that we\u2019re growing our market share particularly in these profitable discretionary categories.  So, that\u2019s really the number one priority, to be right in terms of price in the  marketplace and if we can flow a little bit to the bottom line, that\u2019s an additional benefit.  But, first and foremost is being competitive and increasing our market share.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "A few questions first for Kathy, the way you had described your customers it seemed a bit of a shift with your higher end customers shopping perhaps a little less frequently but adding to perhaps or picking up a little more of a value oriented customer.  Can you just talk about how then you\u2019re assorting the mix?  Where you are do you have the right mix to address what seems to be a little bit of a shift in customer demographics?", "Kathryn A. Tesija ", "Adrianne I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a shift, I think we\u2019re probably describing it more fully now as we\u2019ve seen this trend continuing for some time.  Our best guest, the highest income guest bought lots of discretionary, took many discretionary trips to Target throughout the year and as her budget got tighter we saw her start to be a little bit more choosey about some of those trips.  So, that\u2019s just continued on and I think we understand it better today.  ", "Our guest count is up so we do not believe that we are losing guests, we believe that they are choosing to take fewer of those discretionary trips and I described that a little bit in my comments where they might be picking up an accessory when they come in versus making an apparel trip where they\u2019re going to buy a whole outfit.  In terms of the low end, I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re picking up more at the low end than we are at the high end, I think that we\u2019re just increasing guests overall or increasing trips in the non-discretionary side and guests are being a little bit more particular of how many trips they take on the discretionary side.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "The other thing we\u2019re seeing Adrianne, as we commented, while we\u2019re still attracting new guests they are being far more particular and disciplined in their spending patterns within store.  So, we\u2019ve observed more guests shopping with the circular, circling the items that they want, they\u2019re coming in to our stores, they have lists and they\u2019re very disciplined in terms of making sure that they don\u2019t go beyond what they have on their lists and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in terms of slightly fewer items in the basket, is due to the discipline and the regime that they\u2019re subjecting themselves to in this economic environment.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then just shifting a little bit in terms of the pricing environment out there, you\u2019ve done a great job on inventory control as has your competitors.  Give us a sense, characterize how promotional it is out there?  Clearly, it\u2019s intense focus on price value but where you thought it was going to be and to your point about favorable mark down and improved mark up, you know, your thoughts in terms of ability to flow some of that to the bottom line going forward?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "I would start by going back to the third and fourth quarter of last year and talk about the fact that there was such a glut of inventory in the marketplace as a result of the steep declines in same store sales after everybody had booked their receipts for the latter half of the third and fourth quarter.  So, what we observed during that time frame was the liquidation of inventory levels that were just too high within the marketplace.  ", "What we\u2019ve now observed is most retailers, Target included, have reset their inventory levels and their receipt flow is in much better balance with their sales.  So, we\u2019re experiencing somewhat of a more normalized environment, the environment that we have typically experienced throughout 2007 and the first part of 2008.  So, it\u2019s still competitive and people are aggressive and there\u2019s a fair amount of promotional activity but it is not at the same levels of intensity and the deep discounts and the additional pages and broadcast levels that we were experiencing in the fourth quarter in particular last year.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just lastly Doug, in terms of store growth plans you had mentioned you\u2019re still in the planning stages but perhaps just revisit the range.  I think we had heard five to 30 in 2010, is that still the right range and depending on where you come out that\u2019s how we should think about openings in 2010?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "Yes, we have committed to five stores in 2010 at this point.  That was the same number that we disclosed 90 days ago, we haven\u2019t put any new stores in to that pipeline during that period.  We said 90 days ago we have the potential to add as many as 25 more for the October 2010 cycle.  We still have the potential to add lots and lots of stores in the October cycle but probably not as many as 25 at this point.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Doug, I had a question for you on the credit side and then I guess related to the new prototypes.  On the credit side, could you give us some sense of the pace of decline that you expect managed receivables to be tracking in the second quarter and in to the back half of the year?  Then, can you speak to a lot of credit card providers that we talk to today are seeing the same thing where they had favorable early stage delinquencies but defaults continued to rise and that\u2019s the most troubling thing to them is getting their hands around that not the early stage delinquencies.  So, I guess could you speak to that, about why you feel more comfortable than they would about being able to manage those defaults even though they\u2019re experiencing the same thing in early stage delinquencies?  Then, I had a question around the new prototypes.", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "With respect to total receivables, sometime in the next several months, the next couple of months we will cross over with receivables about equal to last year\u2019s level on a gross basis.  Obviously, with our larger allowance this year on a net basis that\u2019s obviously different timing.  By the time we get in to the back half of the year, by the time we get to the end of the year I continue to expect gross receivables to be down somewhere in the $500 million to $1 billion range. ", "There are obviously a lot of factors that will affect that outcome, please don\u2019t be too harsh if we end up somewhat outside of either end of that range.  There actually could be some very favorable dynamics that would cause us to be outside of that range.  On your question about early stage delinquencies and how that flows through to write offs, I think in many cases our portfolio over time is showing some signs that we\u2019ll end up flowing in to the many of the money center bank portfolios later.  ", "The issue that you\u2019re describing was a profoundly important issue for us three to six months ago as our late stage delinquency and write off experience was far worse relative to early stage delinquencies than it had been historically.  I don\u2019t think you need to look any farther than the quarter just ended in which we correctly assess the flow rates across these different levels of delinquencies and predicted within a fraction of 1% what our net write offs for the quarter would be. ", "I feel quite good about making the same second quarter predictions about net write offs that we made 90 days ago.  So, I think ultimately you\u2019re seeing at minimum some stability in our portfolio, perhaps some net improvement as we get out later in the year in this net write off statistic.  Our enthusiasm is only tempered by continued deterioration in some of the macroeconomic statistics that are tightly correlated with write offs.  If it weren\u2019t for expectations of further deteriorations in unemployment rates, we\u2019d be a little more bullish about our likely net write off experience in the third and fourth quarters.", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "My second question Doug relates to the prototype stores, do you have any refinement in the capital costs around those remodels both maybe from a capital standpoint and just a pure labor expense standpoint?  As you think about that, as you roll those out in \u2018010, whatever number it may be does it change the leverage point at which you think you can lever comps?  And, when can we expect the inventory start flowing through the P&L or through your balance sheet as you begin to prepare for that?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "Several points there, generally as we have incorporated all of our newest thinking in to our new store prototypes, the increment of capital compared to our discount stores in the past, runs in a range of $1 million.  As we think about how much capital we would invest per store to remodel existing discount stores, the number ranges beyond that figure as we incorporate other elements of remodeling throughout the store because once we\u2019re in to a store it just makes a lot of sense to take care of some other unrelated things.  ", "While there\u2019s a wide range, I think that it\u2019s safe to say give or take $3 million is probably a good working figure at this point per copy.  Your leveraging comment is a fascinating one because on the one hand certainly there\u2019s expense related to execution and there\u2019s some increment of ongoing expense but of course the denominator is changing as well, there\u2019s a lot of extra sales.  After all, we wouldn\u2019t be doing this if it didn\u2019t drive uniquely higher sales.  Net/net once we get a little deeper in to this year, we\u2019ll pull together analytically all the pieces of that analysis and talk about it.", "While at the margin it\u2019s an interesting issue, big pictures this is not some kind of fundamental driver of earnings in the short run that you should have any concern about.  On your inventory question, at the margin of course this is much faster turning product than the average product in our stores and therefore even though it adds a modest amount to inventories, it will add a commensurately modest amount to payables and so it really isn\u2019t a cash flow issues nor any kind of inventory that carries any form of fashion risk.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi. ", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "A few questions, one I know you haven\u2019t broken it out historically but how should we think about your comp on your grocery related merchandise?  And, also assuming it becomes an increasingly important category, shed some light on what you are doing to drive your price message here?   Some of the food retailers are now offering free food or other significant kinds of discounts to drive traffic and share?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "Food is still of course only about 15% of our overall sales so today it\u2019s considerably smaller than home or apparel to pick a few not so random examples.  Obviously, it\u2019s growing faster and in our case, even against the back drop of a -3.7% combined same store sales experience in Q1, across the board we were quite positive in food categories, quite positive in Rx, quite positive in OTC so these frequency building categories continue to drive very interesting and highly and perfectly acceptable same store sales performance.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "The promotional intensity and frequency by which competitors use food to draw traffic is really not that dissimilar to what we\u2019ve already been experiencing in other non-food commodity categories whether its household chemicals or paper goods.  So, there are garden variety of ways to promote food and other frequency categories.  I would tell you that first and foremost we\u2019re committed to maintaining an everyday competitive position in the marketplace just like we have for decades in our non-food categories and so we\u2019re going to be focused on ensuring that day in and day out our food prices are equal to or better than our primary competitors which is Wal-Mart. ", "Then, we will deploy the same kinds of promotional tactics as we have traditionally as it relates to exposing and promoting food.  We\u2019ll look at opportunities in print with our circular or direct mail pieces, when we had the right kind of critical mass in  certain markets we will develop broadcast campaigns to convey that or even receipt tape marketing campaigns.  We\u2019ll use the entire Target toolbox to promote food as we increase its presence and density as we roll out fresh in to more stores throughout this year and in to 2010 and beyond.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Then the home category has been quite strong in a lot of your competitors.  Can you just talk about the trends in the category and what you expect to see going forward as well?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "I\u2019m not sure what quite strong means.  I think what has been described as the deeply negative same store sales have become less negative or perhaps in some time frames they may have even become slightly positive.  So, it is still really not a healthy industry overall and part of the same store sales increase or decrease is dependent upon the base period of analysis.  What we\u2019re seeing is there is underlying stability and our business is less negative than it has been in the past but, as Kathy described it\u2019s more about the replacement part of the business so we\u2019re selling more sheets and towels and pillows and pillow cases and we\u2019re doing less redecorating of rooms or full lifestyle kinds of merchandising.  ", "So, it\u2019s still under pressure because it\u2019s such a highly discretionary category but we have seen some signs of stability and some categories are actually performing better than they have in the past.  So, it\u2019s getting better, it\u2019s still not where we would like it to be.", "Kathryn A. Tesija ", "The other thing that I would add to that Deborah is just some of the categories with families eating out less and staying home more we\u2019re seeing some of those categories pop in home, cookware or pantry ware, things of that nature that allow them to do more cooking at home or entertaining of their friends.", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "My questions pertain to credit, I wanted to try and better understand what the likelihood, if any, is that we see the reserve for bad debts come in at a lower pace than write offs going forward?  Obviously, you reserved well in excess of write offs and presumably at some point that can reverse.  I\u2019m just curious if you can give us a little bit of color on that?  Then secondly, as it pertains to the spreads over LIBOR that you achieved in Q1, well known at this point, I was wondering if you can share with us your thoughts of what that might look like going forward taking in to consideration some of the policy changes recently?", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "Well, those of course are related questions to the extent that we expense less than we write off, our spread to LIBOR will increase and our allowance would decrease.  Back to some of my earlier remarks, today we have just a shade over $1 billion in our allowance.  Clearly, if I looked solely at our internal metrics I would be very encouraged about the likelihood of reserve reductions later in the year as this early stage delinquency favorability that we\u2019re currently experiencing to a fairly substantial extent would flow through our thinking and our assessment of the future write off potential of our portfolio at the end of Q2, at the end of Q3 and so forth.", "I only temper that enthusiasm for fairly meaningful potential decreases in our allowance by observing that it\u2019s a tough world out there and it\u2019s a tough world in a lot of respects.  It is a tough world especially in employment and unemployment statics which have historically been very highly correlated with industry write off metrics.  Separately but in a highly related sense, currently our net write off experience is being adversely affected by aggravated levels of personal bankruptcy.  It\u2019s much hard to predict the timing of how that flows through our portfolio than the more scientific approach to figuring out the portion of gross write offs due to aging. ", "But, net/net clearly the reserve is not likely to increase.  The question is to what extent and over what time might it decrease?  We\u2019ll stay on top of this and be as clear as we can moving forward but certainly there\u2019s some potential for some interesting developments in this portfolio, favorable developments from a profitability and a spread to LIBOR sense to the extent that we feel comfortable that it is appropriate to reduce the reserve in light of improving risk metrics if that were to occur in the back half of the year.", "I think Gregg has a few concluding remarks and we\u2019ll let everyone get back to their day.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel ", "That concludes Target\u2019s first quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Thank you all for your participation and ongoing support for our strategy, management and board.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is beingrecorded, Tuesday, November 20th, 2007.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. BobUlrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bob Ulrich", "Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our 2007 third quarterearnings conference call. On the line with me today are Gregg Steinhafel, President; and Doug Scovanner,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I will provide a briefupdate on our view of the current retail environment. Then, Doug will reviewour third quarter and year-to-date 2007 financial results and describe ouroutlook for the remainder of the year. Next, Gregg will provide an update onkey strategic and merchandising initiatives for this year's holiday season aswell as 2008. And finally, I will wrap-up our remarks and we'll open the phonelines for the question-and-answer session.", "This morning we announced our financialresults for the third quarter of 2007. Our performance for the period includedsoft sales in our higher margin apparel and home categories, combinedwith continued solid increases in our lower margin rate consumable andcommodity businesses. This adverse sales mix produced lower than expected grossmargin dollars in our core retail operations, leading to disappointing overallearnings. In contrast, our credit card operations produced yet another quarterof strong results.", "During the third quarter, we continued to expand our storebase, opening a total of 61 new stores in 23 states, including 43 generalmerchandise stores and 18 SuperTarget locations. Net of closing andrelocations, these openings bring our total store count at quarter end to 1,591stores in 47 states.", "As evidenced by the volatility of our sales performance andthat of other retailers during the past few months, the current consumerenvironment and economic climate is somewhat more challenging than earlier inthe year. However, in contrast to the perception created by media reports, wehave not observed any meaningful change in the frequency, timing or level ofpromotional intensity within the industry compared with prior years.", "We remain confident in our Expect More, Pay Less strategy,our ability to stay relevant overtime by delighting our guests with uniquemerchandise designs and exceptional value, and our ability to maintainappropriate and sufficient discipline as we execute our strategy and plan for2008. We believe that we are well-positioned to continue to gain profitablemarket share in the fourth quarter and throughout the coming year.", "Now, Doug will review our results for the third quarter,which were released earlier this morning.", "Doug Scovanner", "Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, we're joined on this conferencecall by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live viawebcast. Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a Q&A session, andSusan Kahn, John Hulbert and I will be available throughout the remainder ofthe day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also anyforward-looking statements that we make this morning should be considered inconjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings.", "In my comments this morning, I'll discuss three topics, eachof which has important implications for our financial performance in the fourthquarter and beyond. First, I'll review key aspects of our third quarterperformance in our core retail operations. Second, I'll describe recentperformance and metrics in our credit card operations. And third, I'll providemore detail on the newly authorized share repurchase program, which weannounced this morning, and provide an update on our review of ownershipalternatives for our accounts receivable. And of course, in conclusion, I'llshare our outlook for the remainder of the year.", "This morning, Target announced financial results for thethird quarter of 2007. Overall, our results were disappointing as performancewithin our core retail operations fell short of our expectations, primarily dueto the effect on our gross margin resulting from softer sale of our highermargin merchandise. Our credit card operations continued to deliver stronggrowth in contribution to our profits.", "Let's review some of the key elements of our third quarterperformance. Total revenues grew 9.3% to $14.8 billion, fueled by thecontribution from new stores, a 3.7% increase in comparable store sales and thegrowth in revenue from our credit card operations. In our retail operations, weexperienced weaker than expected sales performance in our higher margincategories, especially apparel. Even the sales of consumables and commoditiesremained strong.", "Our third quarter gross margin rate was 31.9% of sales, 54basis points lower than last year. All of this net decrease resulted from asoft sales of our higher margin merchandise. And while our expense rateincreased by 14 basis points, remember that our rate analysis continues to be affectedby a couple of small financial reporting refinements that have benefited grossmargin rate and have had a parallel inverse effect on our expense rate over thepast four quarters.", "In other words, analytically, the magnitude of our grossmargin rate decrease was slightly greater than reported and our expense ratewas essentially unchanged from last year. Thankfully, this is the final quarterin which these refinements will have any year-over-year impact on the analysisof these rates.", "Our credit operations continued to deliver strong thirdquarter profit performance. Average receivables grew 19.6% over last year,faster than our pace of sales, primarily due to changing the product featuresfor yet another group of our higher credit quality Target Card accounts tobecome higher limit Target Visa accounts. This most recent wave of activityresulted in higher receivables balances due to increased charge activity bothwithin and outside of our stores.", "As a result of both, our increase in receivables and amodest increase in the core risk metrics in our portfolio, we increased ourreserve in the quarter by $23 million. At this level, we continue to believethat we are adequately reserved for expected losses in the portfolio consistentwith our past practice. On an annualized basis, our credit card contribution toearnings before taxes as a percent of average receivable was 8.6% this yearcompared to 8.8% a year ago.", "Turning to other factors on the P&L, net interestexpense in the third quarter increased $28 million from $149 million a year agoto $177 million this year, primarily due higher average funded balances,including the debt to fund our substantial receivables growth. And oureffective income tax rate for the quarter was 38.1% compared with 37.4% in lastyear's third quarter. This increase was driven by an unusually low rate in thisquarter last year. For the full year, we continue to expect our effective taxrate will increase modestly from our 2006 rate of 38.0%.", "Bringing all these elements together, our third quarterearnings fell short of last year's performance. Specifically, net earningsdecreased 4.4% to $483 million compared with $506 million last year and dilutedearnings per share fell 3.5% to $0.56 from $0.59 a year ago.", "Beyond the P&L, our balance sheet inventory positiongrew 12.2% from a year ago, faster than the 9.0% sales increase in the quarter.However, the relationship between these two growth rates was significantlyinfluenced by the shift in our fiscal calendar, which moved our third quarterend one week closer to the holiday season compared to last year, capturing agreater portion of our typical seasonal inventory build.", "Turning to share repurchase, during the quarter we invested$172 million to buy approximately 3 million shares of our common stock at aweighted average price of $57.29 per share. Through the first nine months of2007, we've repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock, acquiring 19.7million shares at an average price of $60.72 per share.", "Since the program's inception in June 2004, we haverepurchased 90.7 million shares of common stock, representing over 10% of ourcurrent shares outstanding at an average price of $51.20 per share for a totalinvestment of approximately $4.6 billion. Weighted average diluted sharesoutstanding in the most recent quarter were more than 13 million shares lowerthan the corresponding figure last year, a reduction of more than 1.5%.", "As you know, on September 12th, we announced that we wouldconduct a review of the use of debt in our capital structure in the pace of ourshare repurchase activity. This morning we announced the results of thatreview. Our Board has approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program thatreplaces the remaining authorization under our previous program.", "Based on this morning's share price, execution of our newprogram would represent a gross reduction of more than 20% of our currentoutstanding shares. We expect to complete this new share repurchase programwithin approximately three years, and under the right combination of businessresults, liquidity and share price, I would expect to complete half or more ofthe program by the end of 2008.", "Part of the funding for this program is expected to comefrom an increase in the use of debt in our capital structure. Yet, we believeour execution of this program, which is independent of any specific outcomefrom the review of ownership of our credit card receivables, will allow us tomaintain a credit profile consistent with the ratings objectives we outlined inSeptember. Specifically, we said then that we expect to maintain the necessarycredit profile to preserve our long-term debt ratings within the A category. Weare confident this plan achieves that.", "Our September announcement also indicated that we intendedto explore alternative ownership structures for our credit card receivables. Atthis point, we're still engaged in a vigorous review, and it is premature tospeculate on any possible decision coming out of the review. We continue toexpect that we will be able to announce a decision before the end of Decemberand explain our rationale, either to sell or to maintain ownership of some orall of the receivables in the portfolio.", "On the subject to what would happen to share repurchase inthe event of a potential receivable sale, I would expect this possibletransaction to have only a small impact, if any, on the pace of our sharerepurchase execution, depending on how much risk is transferred to a new owner.", "In summary, let me combine all of these elements and sharesome additional perspective on our expectations for the full year. Year-to-datethrough nine months our comparable store sales have increased 4.3% and totalsales have increased over 9%. Our fourth quarter outlook envisions a similarcomparable store sales increase in the range of 3% to 5%, and our total salesincrease sharply lower than our year-to-date growth as we annualize the extraweek in 2006.", "In addition, so far this year, our gross margin and expenserate are each largely unchanged from prior year levels. Looking forward, whilewe expect some continued adverse sales mix effect on our gross margin rate inthe fourth quarter and in 2008, it should be a less important factor than inthe quarter we just completed.", "Separately, we're working very intently on an array ofinitiatives designed to control the growth rate of our expenses to be equal toor lower than our overall growth in sales. We expect these efforts to bearfruit in the fourth quarter and into 2008.", "In our credit card operations, we expect to continue toenjoy strong growth in receivables, driving revenue growth, and strongcontribution to earnings, reflecting disciplined management of our portfoliowith delinquency rates and net write-off rates most likely to remain within therange implicit in our current balance sheet reserve. As a result, we expect tocontinue to enjoy substantial strategic and financial benefits of our creditcard operations regardless of who actually owns our receivables.", "As you know, a variety of factors have contributed to ourbelief since the beginning of this year, that our EPS growth opportunitieswould be greater in the first half than the second half. And while we believethat our year-over-year prospects are better in the fourth quarter than the thirdquarter, our EPS growth will likely be quite modest compared to last year'sresults.", "We remain confident in our underlying strategy and in ourcontinued ability to generate outstanding financial performance over thelong-term. We are confident that our proven record of growth, innovation anddisciplined execution will continue to benefit our shareholders on average withdouble-digit percentage increases in EPS for many years to come.", "Now, Gregg will provide a brief summary of current businesstrends and describe several of our current merchandising initiatives.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thanks, Doug. As Bob and Doug have just described, our thirdquarter financial performance did not meet our expectations. While we aredisappointed with these results, we remain confident in Target's underlyingstrategy and our ability to generate profitable market share growth in thecurrent economic and competitive environment.", "Our focus remains firmly centered on delivering our ExpectMore, Pay Less brand promise to our guests by providing a continuous flow oftrend rate in affordable merchandise in convenient, easy-to-shop stores, and webelieve we are well-positioned to execute this strategy in the fourth quarterand beyond.", "As we head into the holiday season, we are particularlyexcited about our well-balanced assortment of must-have and differentiateditems, all at an exceptional value. For example, we continue to featureexclusive collections and gift items by emerging designers in our apparel andaccessories category. Just last month, Target introduced an assortment oflimited edition shoes and handbags by Holly Dunlap under the celebrated Hollywood label, which will only be in stores for 60days.", "In late December, we will further reinforce our reputationfor affordable style and accessories with our introduction of Loeffler Randall forTarget, a limited time assortment of shoes and handbags by designer JessieRandall.

For example, we continued to improve our product design and developmentprocess to enhance quality and fit and increase speed to market.

We believe that Target is well-positioned to grow profitably inthis economic and competitive environment. And we feel confident that Targetwill continue to deliver substantial value for our shareholders overtime.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, Doug, Gregg and Iwill be a happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelterwith Piper Jaffray.", "Jeff Klinefelter -Piper Jaffray", "Yes. I have a couple of questions for Gregg. Could youprovide any more details on the comp or margin trends of apparel and home as itrelates to the average comp trends of your store right now and what impact ithad on the margins in Q3 and expected to have in Q4 recognizing the mix ispressuring comps? Are the margin trends themselves down in those categories aswell, because of promotional activity?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "No. The gross margin rates in all of our business segmentsperformed well in the third quarter. And our gross margin shortfall isexclusively related to the mix impact of both apparel and to a lesser extenthome growing at a slower rate than our higher growth, lower margin categoriesin hard lines and food.", "Jeff Klinefelter -Piper Jaffray", "Okay. In terms of the comp trends, Gregg, is it somethingwhere it's tracking well below the chain average? Are you still seeing anystabilization in the home? And what are your expectations for Q4 and into thespring season in those two categories?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we still expect some sales mix deteriorations in thefourth quarter, but not to the extent that we experienced in the third quarter.In apparel, specifically, weather patterns are now more normalized than theywere in September, October. As you know, we had record high temperaturesthroughout the nation at that time, and they are reasonably normal. So weexpect some slight deterioration, but not to the same magnitude in apparel.", "Our home business actually has been performing pretty well,softened up a little bit in the third quarter and we expect that to remainsomewhat soft until some of the housing issues go away or, at least, diminishin terms of magnitude.", "Bob Ulrich", "Let me put a little color around that. As you know, onaverage, across the last decade, our lower margin businesses have grown fasterthan our higher margin businesses. In an average year, that puts, give or take,20 basis points of mix related adverse effect into our gross margin rate. Wewere running higher than that through the first two quarters.", "But as I mentioned in my remarks, all of the gross marginrate deterioration in Q3 was mix related. So this mix issue, Q3 this year, wasclearly the most significant mix affected quarter that we've had in many, many,many years running, about triple the adverse mix effect of an average quarter.", "Jeff Klinefelter -Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thank you. One other question is in terms of thesourcing and inflationary pressures, there are some concerns coming,particularly out of China,with inflation on cost. Could you comment on how you see that affecting yourmargin trends the rest of this year and into next year on apparel and the discretionarycategory, but also overall, I think you're looking at some opportunities, thehard lines for sourcing benefits as we move forward?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're experiencing cost pressures right now that willmanifest in the first and second quarter of this year, and it's both domesticand international. We've got a very balanced sourcing portfolio and our apparelexposure in Chinais rather modest, to be honest with you and we have apparel sourcing that isdispersed throughout the world.", "So, we really don't expect much impact in the apparel world.We're experiencing it more in the hard line categories, raw materials, steel,wood, energy-related categories like plastics, storage and in food. In the pastyear or two, we have been able to pass along these costs increases in the formof higher prices. The marketplace had been receptive to that and we hope thatthat type of receptivity continues into '08.", "Jeff Klinefelter -Piper Jaffray", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul withLehman Brothers.", "Robert Drbul - LehmanBrothers", "Hi. Good morning. I just have two questions. The first oneis Doug, can you put a little bit more detail into the receivables portfoliogrowth, the 19.6%? And essentially, can you just give us a little bit, a fewstatistics around the credit worthiness of the changes in the increased creditbalances that you're seeing and have given out?", "Doug Scovanner", "Bob, as always, there are a lot dynamics in the portfolio,but the single biggest driver of the acceleration in the growth of receivablesis that of our most recent wave of executed product changes. Product changes isthe terminology that we use to describe when we take a look into our Target Cardprofile and convert an offer to convert to the guest those cards that arehaving the features of our Visa card sharply higher available to buy andtypically lower rates and so forth.", "This has been a more efficient conversion than priorconversions. The credit quality is the same and the guests are responding byusing the card both, in the store and outside the store in a typical mix ofpurchases. It means that, for example, our penetration rates, the percentagesof our Target store sales reflected on any one of our array of cards isactually, flat to up ever so slightly in contrast to a more typical trend ofbeing down. The increase in the balances is in a higher weighted average bandof FICO scores than the weighted average in the portfolio.", "Having said all of that, clearly, there are some unrelatedto this conversion issues developing in our portfolio and candidly in theportfolios of everyone else we follow that are somewhat adverse. And therefore,we felt that it was appropriate in light of all of that activity, to increaseour reserve this quarter, both as a reflection of the higher size of theportfolio and also as a reflection of some of these modest upticks in risksmetrics.", "Robert Drbul - LehmanBrothers", "Okay. Thank you. And a question for Gregg on the inventory,are there any pockets of inventory that you are concerned about as you headinto the fourth quarter?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "In all honestly, we have managed our inventories very, verywell in the second and third quarter. We had anticipated somewhat of a slowdownin the sales environment and reduced our receipts in the third quarter when wewere in Q1 and Q2. So, aside from being a little heavy here or there, inpockets it's even hard to describe what pockets. There are certain businesses we'rea little over and certain regions where we might be a little over. But overall,it's relatively immaterial in the scheme of things.", "Robert Drbul - LehmanBrothers", "Thank you. Good luck.", "Bob Ulrich", "Next.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Donahue withNeuberger Berman.", "Theresa Donahue -Neuberger Berman", "Good morning, everyone. I just have a quick question on theexpense line, which was very impressive. Could you give a couple of exampleswhat areas that you're looking for opportunities, especially since we hadn'tseen much progress prior at higher comp level?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "I'll start and maybe Doug wants to add some. This is acompany-wide initiative. We are looking at our expense opportunities in ourheadquarters, supply chain property development, marketing and in-stores, bothexpense and productivity. So we're really taking a comprehensive view to bettermanaging our expenses and productivity centers going forward.", "Theresa Donahue -Neuberger Berman", "Okay.", "Doug Scovanner", "There is no one issue in expenses that dominated orcharacterized the key driver of our ability to control this quarter. As usual,some issues up, some issues down in basis points, but we're entering a periodwhere we are putting much more intense focus on making sure that our operatingexpenses grow at no faster than the pace of sales.", "Theresa Donahue -Neuberger Berman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder withJefferies.", "Dan Binder -Jefferies", "Hi. Good morning. I have just a couple of questions oncredit. Last quarter, I think you had cited that some of the excess receivablesgrowth or I should say that some of the receivables growth in excess of saleswas driven from purchases outside the store. It sounded like that continued abit this quarter but you had this other issue that you talked about in terms ofthe product change. I was just wondering, is there a way to quantify of thereceivables growth, how much of that did come from growth outside the store.", "And then, secondly, in terms of thinking about reservesgoing forward is there a rule of thumb we should be thinking about in terms oftargeting bad debt reserves? Is it going to be 25% higher than write-offs ormaybe some metric that we could use in that front?", "Bob Ulrich", "The answer to your first question actually lies on our cashflow statement every quarter because we split the growth imbalances created byuse of the cards inside our store on to a separate line from the growthimbalances attributable to use outside the store. There is some seasonality tothat mix. But, generally speaking, that's a fairly constant relationship with,give or take, 25% or 30% of the charge activity on the cards taking place inour stores and imbalance taking place outside our stores, nothing new here thisquarter.", "Separately, on your question regarding relationships, ourfocus on the allowance as a percent of quarter end receivables, today, we lieat about 7%. That metric has some seasonal influence. So that metric typically,is lower in our fourth quarter than in any of the prior three quarters thatwill likely remain intact this year as well.", "We constantly monitor the risk metrics underpinning theportfolio and will adjust that reserve as appropriate ongoing to maintain avery consistent reserve, relative to the risks that underpin the receivables.As I look forward, I don't think that this will create any kind of meaningfulproblem. But, yet, I would observe there's no doubt that there are someflashing yellow lights on the horizon much more broadly than just ourportfolio. I think we're fully, adequately reserved today.", "Dan Binder -Jefferies", "Okay. And then just a follow-up to Terri's question onexpenses, obviously, the biggest opportunity when sales slow would be, atleast, judging from what I've seen in the past, would be that you manage thelabor in the stores to those levels and during periods of very healthy comps,the stores look absolutely fantastic. I am just curious what kind ofchallenges, if any, you face in keeping the store's standards up as comps slowand perhaps it's necessary to cut back on some of that labor. Is there any wayyou can manage that and still keep the stores in as good a shape as they werelet's say, a year ago?", "Bob Ulrich", "Yes. Clearly, we remain absolutely committed to delightingour guests with a superior shopping experience, and have no intention at all inlowering our standards. Whether it's our brand standards, our in-stock levels,our wait times, our friendly help within our stores, we remain highly committedto delivering a superior experience.", "Having said that, as sales soften, we have opportunity toreduce the number of seasonal hires and just, more carefully, manage theexpense line as it relates to reduced traffic levels and sales around this timeof the year. So we're going to a very thoughtful process, making sure that webalance our short-term and long-term needs of the business and the guests withthe expense opportunities that we identify.", "As Doug said, there is a combination of things that we'regoing to look at. There is no one thing within our stores that we can point tosay this is where we're going to singularly focus our efforts. It's acombination of many, many work centers that we're going to be looking at in termsof saving some expense out of our stores.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Very specifically, lower rates of sales drive lower need forwork in the areas of receiving, replenishment, cashiering. And so, we canmaintain the same standards that are so important to our brand, while incurringfewer hours worked in the stores when fewer units are flowing through thesupply chain inside the store.", "Bob Ulrich", "I would also point it out that we have made majorinvestments in logistics and technology in our stores over the last severalyears and that those are enabling us to become significantly more productivegoing forward. So we remain committed 100% to a great guest experience andwe're confident we can deliver that at the same time we're reducing expense.", "Dan Binder - Jefferies", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom withJP Morgan Chase.", "Charles Grom - JP MorganChase", "Thanks. Good morning. Doug, I was wondering if you cancomment on what your inventory growth was in the quarter, if you would excludethe calendar shifting, and also, if you'd be willing to quantify the actual mixof home and apparel in this quarter versus a year ago as a percentage of sales.", "Doug Scovanner", "About two thirds of that growth differential is due to thecalendar shift. So there really isn't anything significant about therelationship between growth and inventory and sales, absent that shift. And I'mafraid you'll have to repeat the second question.", "Charles Grom - JP MorganChase", "Just the overall mix in the quarter as a percentage of salesif you were to combine home and apparel, just how much did it increaseyear-over-year?", "Doug Scovanner", "In terms of inventories?", "Charles Grom - JP MorganChase", "Just in terms of sales, the actual sales mix.", "Doug Scovanner", "In terms of our sales mix, those two categories representeda lower portion of our sales this year than last year. As I mentioned, slowergrowth in those categories was responsible for, on a net basis, all of thedecline in gross margin rate.", "Charles Grom - JP MorganChase", "Okay. I got you. And then, just switching to the balancesheet, in order to fund the buyback program, could you speak to how high you'rewilling to take up some of your leverage ratios maybe adjusted EBITDA orleverage part of the overall debt-to-cap?", "Bob Ulrich", "I always marvel when people translate what is a very complexset of discussions across three ratings agencies into a handy metrics likethat. We are not specifically focused on any one individual credit metric. Ibelieve the pace of this program, the size of this program has beenspecifically designed after discussions with all three agencies to maintain thecredit profile that we seek to maintain. But it's not a straightforward asfocusing on one key metric. If we did so, and blindly ran our business to thatmetric, I don't think any of us would be very happy with the outcome.", "Charles Grom - JP MorganChase", "Alright, fair enough. And then, one more question for Gregg.Yesterday, you announced that November was on plan. I am wondering if there isan improvement. It sounds like the environment is giving you more confidenceand if you could speak directly to trends in some of those areas that were weakin October, home, apparel and toys?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, even though they are on plan, they are still somewhatmore modest in terms of sales expectation compared to our original plan threeand six months ago and we're seeing balanced sales across the chain. We've seenapparels strengthen as weather patterns normalized. Our home businesses areperforming about where they have in the past and the balance of the businesseshas been performing well. We expect the electronics business to continue tooutpace the company that has been strong all year and continues to be very strong.So we expect it to be a bellwether season there.", "Our toy business has been somewhat volatile. There has beena lot of recall activity that has caused our consumer to be somewhat cautiousin this particular category with sourcing strength in other categories, as theymigrate to less traditional toys. But, having said that, the toy businessstarted to strengthen this month as well, so, we're cautiously optimistic that,overall, we're going to have a decent holiday season.", "Charles Grom - JP MorganChase", "Thanks. Good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Christine Augustinewith Bear Stearns.", "Christine Augustine -Bear Stearns", "Thank you. Doug, could you talk about just overall expensetrends, benefits, utilities, maybe real estate costs, what you might be seeingso far this year versus the average of the last few? And then, if possible,could you give us your preliminary thoughts on where those expense trends mightgo in '08?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, the great news is year-to-date this year not only ourexpense is well-controlled as a percentage of sales, there really isn't anysignificant category that's moving the needle meaningfully in either direction.We're down to single digit basis point movements across the board. And one ofthe reasons that I'm quite encouraged about that is that, of course, we'reoperating in an environment where sales have slowed to a pace below of what wehad forecasted at the beginning of the year, said differently, that issometimes the recipe for hitting our dollars budgets and missing the mark interms of a basis point analysis.", "Having said all of that backup, certainly, there are someinflationary drivers in the expense base, utilities and property taxes, and toa lesser extent medical expenses would be among the more onerous drivers. Thesingle biggest variable, of course, always remains the number of hours of laborthat we choose to employ with our teams in our stores. There are a couple ofthings that are beneficial as well. Marketing expense, for example, on ayear-to-date basis is actually, slightly favorable despite the fact that it wasunfavorable in the quarter due to timing issues.", "Christine Augustine -Bear Stearns", "And would you be willing to give any preliminary thoughts on'08 as you look to your planning process? Do you think there will be anymaterial changes in these line items?", "Doug Scovanner", "No. I don't. I think that as Gregg indicated, we're takingour time to perform an intensive review across the board, and there are nofundamental changes that we are intending to dial in here. We're just carefullyfocusing on making sure one line item at a time that we're dialing in the rightexpenses relative to the pace of our business, while paying particularattention to maintaining the brand standards that are so important to us.", "Christine Augustine -Bear Stearns", "How about your views with regard to new store openings? Asthe environment softens, would you maybe try to take advantage of that and,perhaps, accelerate, or in this kind of environment, do you look to maybe scaleback a bit? I'm just wondering how you view at this time around versus priordownturns in the economy.", "Doug Scovanner", "We have a very, very steady hand on the throttle at the realestate helm. Obviously, if there were substantial bargains to be had in thekind of real estate that we seek, we'd be delighted to accelerate our storeopening program. There are lead times that need to be respected. So thatcertainly wouldn't affect '08 or even hypothetically, '09. But I think that's afalse premise. There is no discernable reduction in commercial real estateprices for the kinds of land that we seek to develop, quite the contrary is inthe case for some period of time.", "We are very unlikely to materially, or even meaningfully,change the pace of capital reinvestment that we think is the right pace for ourbusiness. That would take a very sustained period of softer performance to haveus rethink the value of those kinds of strategically important investments.", "Christine Augustine -Bear Stearns", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Husson withHSBC.", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Yeah. Back to procurements a little bit, you have said thatindividual categories had quite good gross margin performances. Could you alsotell us what you did to get them? And from our metrics, it looks like you'vespread your sourcing out to other countries away from China, more India andother Asia, and perhaps you've gone direct more. Can you update us on thedirect percentage and other sourcing, including USA, by the way?", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Direct import percentage remains around 30% to 31%. We hadramped that up aggressively over the last four or five years. And we have nowreached a point where it's going to grow at a much slower rate, probably in theneighborhood of 50 to 100 basis points a year. So, I would not expect largechanges in our direct import percentage. And as we've said, we've got abalanced portfolio of sourcing, both domestic and internationally and we shiftand make adjustments based on a variety of conditions.", "Our gross margin rates were well-balanced across all of ourcategories. So we made our gross margin rate expectations in home, apparel,food and hard lines. And so that's the combination of a lot of different thingsthat we do to manage the margin rates, whether it's saving markdowns orfocusing on cost reductions or investments in our promotional markdowns. It'scombinations of things that enabled us to make our gross margin rates bybusiness segment.", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "And it sounds like fuel price inflation and also the genericenvironment has not been damaging in the quarter as far as gross margin ratesare concerned.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "It wasn't that. We've seen inflationary pressures kind ofebbing and flowing throughout the year. We faced more pressure early in theyear. It somewhat abated in the second, third and fourth quarter. But we areexpecting that to accelerate again in the first and second quarter of nextyear.", "Bob Ulrich", "It's only a slight oversimplification for all of us to thinkabout our gross margin rate in the lower middle 30\u2019s, as simply being thealgebraic blend of, give or take, 40% of our sales with gross margin ratescategory-by-category that are in excess of 40% and about 60% of our salescategory-by-category with gross margin rates of 25% more or less. The entiregross margin rate issue year-over-year in this quarter is the algebra behindthat blend. Across the board, we enjoyed, give or take reasonably similar grossmargin rates to last year's gross margin rate category-by-category. This is alla sale mix issue in the quarter.", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Given that they're quite different from each other, thosetwo gross margin groups, are you doing something overtime that is going tomeaningfully accelerate the amount of gross margin you'll get from the 25%category and does that have any implication for the return on invested capitalovertime?", "Bob Ulrich", "Well, I think this mix issue is actually misleading morethan it's helpful because this chain remains very healthy financially overtimeto the extent that we can maintain 3% or 4% same-store sales growth in thehigher margin categories. But, of course, the lower margin categories enable usto be able to do that. And so, I'd be thrilled with the horrible mix problem of10 comps in the lower margin businesses and five comps in the higher marginbusinesses, because even though those that follow rates would be disturbed, thebottom-line would be gushing profitably.", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller withWilliam Blair.", "Mark Miller - WilliamBlair", "Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify the inventory ona same calendar basis. Are you saying that inventory would be up 4% were it notfor the calendar shift? And then, I know sometimes there are other anomalieswith inventory on the boats coming across, what would be the same calendarsame-store inventory growth?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "First half of your question, yes, our inventories would havegrown slower than sales if it were not for the calendar shift. That's howimportant a week is in our inventory picture at this time of the year. Yourquestion about the boats was not clear to me. Try me again.", "Mark Miller - WilliamBlair", "Well, just on a same-store basis, I know in the past, as youhad timing of receipts, product coming across from outside this country thathad impacted the inventory levels, what's the same-store inventory growthlooking at that?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, our picture of inventory, at any point in time,includes inventory that's in transit on the ocean by and large because wealready own substantially, all of that inventory. So the balance sheet includesall inventory that we own regardless of where it is in the globe. So it'sstraightforward to answer your question by correlating the 4% increase ininventories to the slightly higher increase in our store counts to observe thatinventories on a comp per store was slightly down, flat to down.", "Mark Miller - WilliamBlair", "Great, thanks. And then, could you talk about the trendsacross the good, better, best spectrum, particularly in home and apparel? Andas you've seen the slowing, is that slower rate of unit off take or you'reseeing any change in the rate at which the consumers are willing to trade up?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "It's somewhat of a mix bag. We are seeing actually theconsumer trading up slightly in apparel. The same dynamics are true in the hardlines and food side of our business, and there is somewhat of a slight tradedown in the home area. For example, we see stronger performance in our basicbedding area rather than our collection bedding area. So more of the trade downis happening in the home but the balance of the business we don't see any tradedown whatsoever.", "Mark Miller - WilliamBlair", "And then, final question, Gregg, can you talk how thatrecent experience would impact the way you think about assortment for 2008 andare you making changes at this point?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're not making material changes to our assortment. We'veworked really hard in getting the appropriate balance of good, better, best. Wethink this is more temporary in nature and that, over the long-term, ourcurrent mix of assortments is about appropriate for what the business potentialis. So, we're going to make some adjustments, but overall, we're prettyconfident that we have the right mix.", "Mark Miller - WilliamBlair", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapirawith Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira -Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Just first-off, talking about the morechallenging environment, could you share with us any regional differencesyou're seeing in performance?", "Bob Ulrich", "Really, there are just a few parts of the countries that area bit slower. Florida has been a little bit slower, a little bit of the inlandsouthern part of California has been a little bit slower, and a touch in theOhio, Michigan, Indiana area. But overall, the rest of the country is pretty well-balanced.", "Adrianne Shapira -Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Doug, you had mentioned, obviously, the initiativesfocusing on expenses. Could you remind us the level of comps you needed tobegin leveraging expenses what that was, and perhaps, going forward, what theopportunity in terms of that number coming down?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well, this is a very crude shorthand. But with that spiritin mind, the answer to your question is, I think, we have historically operatedwith the need for about a 4% to 5% same-store sales performance to neutralizeSG&A as a percent of sales. And clearly, we're working very hard to bringthat range down by 100 to 200 basis points.", "Adrianne Shapira -Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great and then just the last question. I know youdescribed qualitatively direction of the segments we are heading into thefourth quarter, but in light of the third quarter performance and perhaps, thebuyback activity, could you just update, perhaps, your view on the year? Ithink the last we have heard is lower than 360, but perhaps, any update onguidance for the year?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well, as you know, we have not provided specific guidancefor any quarter this year and the fourth quarter is no different. The best Ican do to answer that question is to have you take our year-to-date performanceand add to it the outlook for the fourth quarter that I gave earlier,specifically, that we expect a very modest EPS increase in the quarter.", "Let's not lose sight of the fact that we have talked manytimes in the past about the $0.02 to $0.04 per share that we earned in theextra week last year. That missing week means that our year-over-year salesgrowth in total, not comp, in total during the fourth quarter, will be a low tomid single digit figure. So that's a very important feature in understandingwhat's going on with our EPS growth this quarter, both in our core retailoperations and in our credit card operations, that extra week createdprofitability last year.", "AdrianneShapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Uta Werner with SanfordBernstein.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning. Doug, I wonder if you could please comment onhow new stores have done over the past two months and specifically, theproductivity ramp-up that you've observed?", "Doug Scovanner", "Typically, our experience in the last couple months is nodifferent from our experience in the past. Our new stores typically, are anexaggerated example of what's happening in the rest of the chain. When the restof the chain is healthy, our new stores typically open much more strongly andwhen sales are weak, our new stores open even weaker. This is not a new issue,nor at all disturbing. These new stores are terrific investments that will paysplendid dividends moving forward.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Could you also maybe remind us on how remodeled stores arecomping, relative to un-remodel stores?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we really look at our remodels in a couple ofdifferent ways. In remodels, where we expand the footprint of the buildingitself, we are seeing dramatic increases, consistent double-digit increases inour comp store sales before and after the remodel. In remodels that occurwithin the shell of the building and we are not dramatically expanding thesales, but we see more modest, but still the kinds of sales growth necessary tosupport the investment in that remodel. So we're pleased with both thein-the-box and expansion remodel program.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you. I have a different question related to grossmargin, specifically, on consumer electronics. I wondered if you can update uson what's the current level of service contract attachments, want to have yourlevels of returns be and how do you recover on the returns?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The attachment rates, we've now had our ESP program in placefor about a year and we continue to see gains in our attachment rates onaverage. When you're across the board in all categories, we're seeingattachment rates in the low double-digit area, and when you specificallyzero-in on categories like LCD or more expensive LCD televisions, we're seeingvery healthy attachment rates of over 30%.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "And in terms of return?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're not seeing any appreciable change in our return ratesin any product categories.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Great. On the same line of question here, to what extent doyou expect significant revenue to come from selling pre-owned electronics onthe Internet?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "That is a test program for it. And it's very, very, verytiny and totally insignificant as it relates to the sales impact on either atthe dotcom business or the corporation's business.", "Doug Scovanner", "I'll add two more verys to that answer.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Is that pre-owned merchandise, fundamentally returnedmerchandise?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "It is returned and refurbished and it is a test that wasinitiated, I think, approximately 30 days ago. And we have not made a decisionwhether or not we're going to continue this or not. Early indications are it'sbeen very positive. But again, it's very, very, very insignificant.", "Doug Scovanner", "Borne out of the fact that a substantial portion of returnedmerchandise is in perfect working order.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "It was very [smart to answer]. It was really only an iPodthing. So it's just not relevant.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Great and my last question in the same spirit, to whatextent can you comment on how the Internet has been doing?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Our Internet and dotcom business has been having a very,very good year. We're very pleased with the business. But like the storesbusiness, we have seen it slow down. And our sales rates have moderatedsomewhat compared to the very robust increases we were seeing in the earlyparts of the year.", "Bob Ulrich", "Okay. We have time for questions from two more people.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melichwith Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Melich -Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks. Gregg, earlier in the year you mentioned thatyou got pretty conservative on the buying for the second half and that seemsto, at least, help control the inventories. How do you see the buyings earlynext year and we'll take a look past Christmas right now, but what's your planthere?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we're looking well past Christmas at this particularof point in time based on the lead times in our business. So, we're expectingthat, at least, what I would say for first quarter for sure and probably intothe second quarter, we expect the soft sales environment to continue, and thatthe discretionary categories like apparel and home will be under more pressurethan the hard lines and food categories. So, we pulled back our receipts inthose businesses to reflect rates of sale that are going to be more modest thanwhat we've experienced in the past.", "Gregory Melich -Morgan Stanley", "And so, I guess as a follow-up on that, if gross margin ismade to improve from the shift as it was all mix in this quarter, how does thathappen, if we expect home and apparel will continue to just stay comp zero, forexample?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, this is where we're planning the business. We haveample inventory as part of our base inventory that can support sales growthinto the mid comp range. And so, we're very confident that we can be in-stockand can support an increased sales activity. Secondly, we will experiencegreater sell-through levels in our apparel and home areas if we perform better.So rather than selling through three quarters of our assortment beforemarkdown, we'll see greater sell-through rates which yield higher profitabilityrates, if this should happen.", "Bob Ulrich", "In addition, as you know Greg, we're never satisfied withsimply maintaining gross margin rates other than mix. So we will continue tohave significant focus on all of the core drivers of margin rate withincategories ranging from benefits to markup associated with global sourcing,penetration increases to programs designed to control markdowns and inventoryshrink and so forth. The fact that we're net even on all of the rest of thatactivity in this quarter doesn't mean that we are satisfied with being net evenexcluding mix.", "Gregory Melich -Morgan Stanley", "That's great. And just to make sure I'm clear on that, whenyou say the softness will continue, that means you would expect comps tocontinue to run three to four into the first and second quarter or would it beanother downtick?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we haven't issued specific guidance for thattimeframe. So I think that's a little premature to get that specific, but weexpect continued pressure in categories like apparel and home.", "Gregory Melich -Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Bob Ulrich", "Last question, please.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Wayne Hood withBMO Capital.", "Wayne Hood - BMOCapital", "Good morning, Doug. I guess I wanted to come back to credita second. Everybody can't agree on the economics or control in this transaction,would you be willing to let go and just to do a big securitization of thatportfolio or would you just keep it as\u2026", "Doug Scovanner", "I missed the front half of your question. I understood theback half.", "Wayne Hood - BMOCapital", "Yeah. I was just wondering, everybody can't come to anagreement on shared economics and control and things like that, would you bewilling to let go and just do a large securitization of those receivables thatyou continue to manage with through that structure.", "Doug Scovanner", "In the hypothetical event that we do not find the economicsto be attractive while shifting a substantial amount of the risk of ownershipof this portfolio through a third-party, in that event we would, of course, paycareful attention to what is the most effective way to fund this portfoliomoving forward given that in that event we would continue to own all of therisks. I would expect to continue to own all of the profitability out of theportfolio as well. But we would, of course, look at an array of financingalternatives relative to the status quo. But the status quo has proved to be avery effective method of funding that portfolio in the past.", "Wayne Hood - BMOCapital", "Second question is kind of related to that, if you look atthe aging of the portfolio in the current quarter, it looked relatively flat.Yet, as you talked about the reserve is up, write-offs were up. Are you seeingthe current files, the ones that are not falling pass due filing for bankruptcyare charging off? That's unexpected because that's one thing that kind ofsurprises you, those current accounts going past towards (inaudible) chargethem off or no.", "Doug Scovanner", "There is nothing surprising going on there and I'm afraidwe're into double overtime. I'd be more than happy to follow-up with anyone onthe line with more detail on that issue or any other issue as the dayprogresses. I think Bob has a few closing remarks.", "Bob Ulrich", "Well, that concludes our third quarter 2007 earningsconference call. As Doug mentioned, he, Susan and John are available anytimeduring the day to answer any additional questions.

Welcome to the Target Corporation fourth quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bob Ulrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir. ", "Robert Ulrich", "Good morning, welcome to our 2007 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Gregg Steinhafel, President, and Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "This morning I will provide a brief overview of our results and the current retail environment. Then Doug will review our 2007 fourth quarter and full year financial results in greater depth and describe our outlook for the remainder of the year. Next, Gregg will provide an update on key strategic, operational and merchandising initiatives for 2008. And finally, I will wrap up our remarks and we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. ", "This morning we announced our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, 2007. These results fell short of our expectations as a more difficult economic environment and a hesitant consumer constrained our sales growth - especially in discretionary categories - and adversely affected our overall profitability. ", "As we enter 2008, it seems likely that we will continue to face a challenging economic climate, at least through the first half of the year. As a result, we are keenly focused on the disciplined execution of our core business operations, continued thoughtful management of our expenses, and an unwavering devotion to deliver the excitement, innovation, design and value that consistently delight our guests. ", "Target is fortunate to have a powerful brand, a seasoned leadership team and a proven strategy that has successfully navigated economic downturns in the past. We are committed to improving our recent performance without sacrificing any aspect of our brand and without compromising our overall guest experience. By remaining relevant to our guests and consistently delivering on our \"Expect More, Pay Less\" brand promise we are confident that Target will continue to enjoy profitable market share growth in 2008, and beyond, in a variety of economic conditions. ", "Now Doug will review our results for the fourth quarter and full year which were released earlier this morning. ", "Douglas Scovanner", "Thanks Bob. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via webcast. Following our prepared remarks we will conduct a Q&A session and Susan Kahn, John Hulbert and I, will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings. ", "In my comments this morning I will discuss three topics, each of which has important implications for our future results. First, I will review key aspects of our fourth quarter performance in our core retail and credit card operations. Next, I'll detail our fourth quarter activity under our share repurchase authorization. And finally I'll share our outlook for our business in 2008. ", "This morning Target Corporation announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007. As Bob mentioned, we experienced disappointing financial results for the quarter and the year as we faced the challenge of a sharply softer sales trend in the quarter while comparing against an extra week in last years fourth quarter and fiscal year. ", "Some key elements of our fourth quarter performance were total revenue growth of 0.8% due to the contribution from new stores, a 0.2% increase in same-store sales, growth in revenue from our credit card operations and cycling the impact of an extra week in last year's fourth quarter. ", "On an equal thirteen-week over thirteen-week basis, our revenues increased 6.3% in the quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate declined 53 basis points from last year. Approximately 60% of this decline was due to the impact of faster sales growth in our lower margin consumable and commodity categories. The magnitude of this mix impact is about half of our experience in the third quarter and more in line with our experience in the first and second quarters of the year. The remaining gross margin rate on favorability in the fourth quarter was driven by clearance related markdown activity resulting from slower than expected sales. ", "In our third quarter conference call, I commented that we had undertaken an array of initiatives to control the growth of expenses in the fourth quarter and 2008, and I'm pleased with the progress evident in our fourth quarter performance. Our expense rate in the quarter remained essentially flat to last year. This is particularly remarkable in light of our soft same-store sales and the de-leveraging impact of a shorter fiscal period this year. The single biggest driver of this performance was very effective control of hourly payroll expense in our stores. Our year-over-year improvement in this metric for the quarter was the best that we have achieved in the past five years. ", "Results in our credit card operations during the fourth quarter remained strong with performance in line with the expectations we outlined at the end of the third quarter. Receivables at the end of the quarter were 29% higher than year-end 2007. This growth reflects many factors, including the impact of last summer's actions in which we offered higher limit Target Visa Cards to another group of our better and best credit quality Target Card guests. In addition, our current receivables balance reflects the impact of an industry-wide decline in payment rates that began in the third quarter. ", "Our write-off in delinquency metrics in the fourth quarter were somewhat higher than a year ago but were consistent with the expectations we have previously discussed. At the bottom line for the fourth quarter, the contribution to earnings before taxes from our credit card operations grew 12% from $122 million in 2006 to $137 million this year. This profit growth is particularly satisfying in light of overall card industry dynamics and our shorter fiscal period in 2007.", "Now let's turn our attention to our fourth quarter share repurchase activity. Just 90 days ago we announced a new $10 billion share repurchase authorization which replaced our prior program. At the time, we said that under the right combination of business results, liquidity and share price, that we would expect to complete half or more of this new program by the end of 2008. We took two large steps toward this objective during the fourth quarter. First, we purchased 26.5 million shares in the open market, investing just under $1.5 billion. This equates to a weighted average price of $54.64 per share. Next, we executed a series of derivatives transactions which are highly likely to lead to significant share repurchase activity in 2008. ", "I think it's useful to describe our motivation to execute in this fashion, and the range of potential outcomes that will follow as well. In December and early January, our shares fell to about $50 which represented a compelling repurchase opportunity in our eyes. Yet we recognized that it would not be fiscally responsible to aggressively pursue significant share repurchase activity until we had the proceeds in hand from our planned January bond offering. The solution we devised was to enter into a series of derivative transactions, allowing us to control the repurchase of an incremental 30 million shares, representing just under 4% of our total shares outstanding, while investing a small fraction of the cash required for an open-market purchase of this size. ", "We executed this by buying well in-the-money call options and we significantly reduced our cash investment by selling a like number of out-of-the-money call options. The result is that we paid a net option premium averaging $11 per share and we'll likely exercise these options in April through June to acquire 30 million shares for additional payments, averaging $39.68 per share. The effect, if any, of the options we sold would be to increase our aggregate investment to an amount $6.40 per share below the then current stock price, but only if our share price exceeds about $57 at the respective exercise dates. ", "As we look forward to 2008, in our core retail operations we are planning for sales growth to increase in the 8-9% range, reflecting the continued contribution from new stores and an expected comparable store sales increase in the range of 2-3%. This outlook explicitly assumes that our sales growth will be much better in the second half of the year as we begin to cycle our softer sales results of the second half of 2007. ", "In light of this sales outlook we think it's prudent to plan for a slight to modest operating margin rate decline in our core retail operations driven by a similar degree of gross margin rate deterioration. We are working very hard to mitigate or even eliminate this outcome, but we think it's more realistic in this environment to assume that we would experience continuing gross margin rate pressure as opposed to enjoying expanding gross margin rates. ", "However, very importantly, we have plans in place that should allow us to hold our growth in SG&A expenses to a high single-digit percentage increase, similar to or slightly lower than our expected growth in sales. Finally, given our assumed pace of sales growth, we expect to experience slight de-leveraging in depreciation expense which will naturally grow at low double-digit percentage pace. ", "In our credit card operations in 2008, we expect to enjoy continued growth in contribution to our overall earnings before taxes. Certainly, a more harsh scenario could develop. Many of you have outlined that case for us in detail. We just don't believe that case is very likely. As you know, our receivables balances grew at a very strong pace in the second half of 2007. And while the sequential growth is behind us, we will continue to enjoy the benefit of this growth on a year-over-year basis in the first half of 2008. Our EBT yields will likely remain at industry leading levels, although not likely fully achieving the record levels we set in 2007, especially in the first half of the year. ", "We expect delinquency rates to remain stable throughout 2008 at recent levels in the range of 4%. And our net write-offs as a percentage of average receivables are not likely to rise much above 7%. In summary, both of these core risk metrics are highly likely to remain well within acceptable ranges for our profit and investment formulas to work well. ", "Finally, we expect to continue to create significant long-term value by executing share repurchase under the program announced last November. And as stated at that time, I continue to expect that under the right combination of operating results, liquidity and share price, we will have executed half or more of the $10 billion program by the end of 2008. Today, I would only add the comment, that in order to execute more than half of the program by year-end 2008, we would need to enjoy reasonably good operating results during the year. ", "At this time, the current median first call EPS estimates for Target envision $0.73 in the first quarter and $3.56 for the full year 2008. These estimates lie within a reasonable range of potential outcomes in our view. If achieved, these projections would represent a slight decline in the first quarter as we cycle the strong start we achieved in the first quarter of 2007 and would represent about a 7% increase for the full year. ", "In summary, while we have clearly felt the impact of the economic slowdown in 2007 and we continue to expect a soft sales environment going into 2008 we remain confident in the strength of our underlying strategy and in our ability to get back to double-digit percentage increases in EPS in a more typical economic environment. Until that time, we remain focused on flawless execution, prudent control of expenses, thoughtful investment in our stores and systems, opportunistic share repurchase and an unwillingness to make short-term decisions that would hamper our potential for success in the longer-term. ", "Now Gregg will provide a brief summary of current business trends and initiatives we are planning in 2008. Gregg.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thanks Doug. As Bob and Doug have just described, our 2007 financial performance did not meet our expectations as solid sales and earnings results in the first half of the year weakened considerably in the third and fourth quarters. From a merchandise perspective, our sales in 2007 reflected a typical spectrum of relative performance. We experienced strong comparable store sales growth in our Food, Health and Wellness and other commodity categories as well as in both Electronics and Sporting Goods. In addition, we were pleased with the sales growth in 2007 in both our Ladies' Apparel and Newborn Infant and Toddler categories.", "In contrast, Toys had a particularly challenging year, especially in the second half of the year, as recall related activity affected the entire industry and sales of prerecorded music and movies continued to decline in 2007. Other weak categories for the year included Jewelry and Accessories, Shoes, Men's Apparel, Domestics and Christmas Seasonal. ", "Throughout the year we intensified our focus on driving more frequent guest visits, delivering great value and increasing reliability across the chain. We also continued to deliver on the \"Expect More\" half of our brand promise by providing a constant flow of new designs and innovation throughout the store. ", "We continued to improve our operational performance and speed-to-market through innovation and investment in our infrastructure, supply chain and technology. In particular, we continued to strengthen our global sourcing capabilities, enabling us to shorten lead times and reduce costs while delivering trend rate quality merchandise. ", "We remained focused on product safety, launching new technology to improve the process of analyzing the testing and inspection results for factories making our own-brand products. We also expanded our multi-stage testing process to more categories across the store, allowing testing of our own-brand products earlier and throughout the product lifecycle. ", "And we remain dedicated to delivering a superior guest experience by delivering strong in-stocks, effectively managing inventory and receipts, maintaining our highly competitive position in the marketplace, and by opening new stores and investing in our existing stores through remodel projects. ", "In 2008, we are diligently working to drive stronger top-line growth by remaining focused on superior execution combined with continuous innovation in support of our brand. As always we will continue to make tactical adjustments in our content and pricing to address the significant near-term challenges presented by the current economic environment, particularly in discretionary home and apparel categories. ", "However, we will not compromise our long-term commitments to delight our guests, to deliver on our \"Expect More, Pay Less\" brand promise, and to continue to generate profitable market share growth and shareholder value. In support of these goals we recently launched Converse One-Star apparel in Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s as well as a full footwear assortment. This new brand delivers an elevated level of quality and detail at exceptional value with original and authentic style. ", "We partnered with leading modern home company Dwell Studio to introduce Dwell Studio for Target. Our exclusive infant and home assortment feature modern bedding, table top and infant furnishings. We are reinventing our Fieldcrest assortment by increasing the value proposition through upgraded quality fabric and exceptional prices. Next month we will expand our beauty offerings to include more natural and organic brands with nine lines from premiere brands, ranging from Dr. Bronners Magic Soap to Giovanni Organic Cosmetics. ", "We will continue to develop partnerships with emerging designers and introduce fresh and unique designs throughout the store such as our next goal international collection called Jovovich Hawk for Target by designers Milla Jovovich and Carmen Hawk. In accessories we will launch Subversive for Target, an eclectic array of bracelets, earrings and necklaces at an exceptional value by renowned jewelry designer Justin Giunta.", "We launched three styles of reusable shopping bags across the chain providing an eco-friendly option that our guests can feel good about using on their future visits to our stores. And we will continue to be our guests' destination for seasonal businesses by offering a balance of unique trend rate offerings and must have basics for every occasion and change of season. ", "To ensure we are consistently and efficiently executing our business strategies, we remain focused on finding additional opportunities to leverage our world class sourcing technology and supply chain capabilities. Our continued focus on improving our product design and development process is allowing us to enhance quality and reduce cycle times while maintaining our commitment to value. In addition, we are pursuing opportunities to reduce inventory while improving in-stock levels, improving transit time and eliminating costs throughout our supply chain both domestically and internationally. ", "In addition, we will continue to invest strategically in new stores and our distribution infrastructure. In 2008, we expect to build approximately 116 new stores, adding about 95 new locations net of relocations and closings. Included in those store openings, in October we will open our first two general merchandise stores in Anchorage, Alaska, allowing us to serve more guests and expand our reach to this new market.

And later in the year we will open our first Target-owned semi-automated food distribution center in Lake City, Florida. By asserting greater control of the food perishable component of our supply chain we will improve our food margins, better manage freshness and enable continued rapid growth of Target\u2019s own brands in our food assortment. ", "Also, as Doug discussed earlier, we are keenly focused on controlling the growth of our expenses particularly in light of our current slow pace of comparable store sales. We are pleased with the progress we have made so far, but the evaluation of potential opportunities is far from complete. We remain keenly focused on making smart decisions that eliminate unnecessary expense without compromising anything that makes Target a great place to shop and a great place to work.

You said two to three for the year. I\u2019m curious on how that will build through the year and what would be the drivers. Is there going to be more of a transaction size versus number of transactions at this point?", "", "Douglas Scovanner", "", "A couple comments to put some color around that. I think you can quite usefully model this by taking a careful look at our sales pace in \u201907. The sales strength will build throughout the year and will likely be much stronger, particularly in the fourth quarter as we cycle against much weaker numbers in the fourth quarter of 2007. So the base of performance is what\u2019s behind our comments, not some kind of macroeconomic judgment call. As to the make-up of our same-store sales performance between same-store traffic and growth in average ticket, I think that 2008 will continue a string of many, many years where the bulk of our improvement in same-store sales will likely be made up from growth in average ticket as opposed to same-store transaction counts or traffic.

So, Doug, you\u2019re not making any assumptions in your plan for a rebound of traffic in the second half of the year like we\u2019ve heard from some other retailers.

Thank you and then just one for Gregg. In terms of your sourcing initiatives I know you\u2019ve discussed recently your efforts in hard lines. You\u2019ve done a great job in soft lines. You\u2019re going to move to hard lines and look for opportunities for margin expansion there through TSS. Can you give us an update on that and what the margin implication may be for \u201908?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we\u2019re not expecting any margin expansion in \u201908. As you know, we\u2019re fairly fully penetrated in Apparel and we\u2019re reasonably penetrated now in the bulk of hard lines categories, particularly in Home.

Certainly there are some categories that are inflating, food products come to mind in particular, but as you know we don\u2019t sell a lot of food compared to some of our competitors and that food inflation was more than amply offset by deflation in hard lines categories. I think electronics in particular. Looking into \u201908, I believe that this equation is reasonably neutral where we continue to have some significant inflation in some categories but on an overall basis I don\u2019t think it will be meaningful to our aggregate sales picture.

The follow-up on that is, given the sharpness of the decline in the sales and in the traffic in the fourth quarter you\u2019ve been able to keep SG&A pretty flat.

It was particularly exciting to me in light of the fact that the cycling the extra week naturally de-leveraged this rate and in addition much harder to accomplish in a softer sales environment, as you know. But we saw this one coming. We\u2019ve been talking about this and planning for this for quite some time and I think the performance in our store hourly labor productivity in Q4 is a great leading indicator of what\u2019s likely to happen in 2008 as well.

Doug, if I can ask you about the margin outlook a little bit. I think you said slight to modest operating margin rate decline and most of that gross margin driven.

Is it like your comp guidance, do you assume margins sort of are up year-over-year in the second half?", "Douglas Scovanner", "", "Well first of all, as you know Virginia, we have averaged 20 or 25 basis points of pressure on gross margin rate each year for the last decade.

To be precise, the options that we currently hold give us the right to purchase 30 million shares, exactly 30 million shares, and in addition, the likelihood of exercising those options, it is highly likely, virtually certain, that we will execute yet more share repurchase activity in the open market during 2008.", "Virginia Genereux - Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s great.

I wonder if you could comment specifically about the massive price action we\u2019ve seen at Wal-Mart, where it seems their implementation on price leadership has changed a little bit.

They, fairly typically, have reduced prices and initiated rollbacks to the tune of a billion dollars per year as they enter seasonal time frames like Easter and back-to-school, back-to-college, in fourth quarter as we get into the holiday season. So perhaps they\u2019re doing a better job of marketing that message. But in all practicality, what we\u2019re observing in the marketplace is no real change in terms of the number of items they\u2019re marking down or rolling back, or the depth of those discounts. ", "As it relates to Isaac Mizrahi, we\u2019ve enjoyed a terrific five-year relationship with Isaac, and I think you all are over representing what it means at Target. It\u2019s approximately 3% of our Apparel and Accessories business, and we really view his strength as a niche contemporary collection, and any efforts that we have had to move beyond that were unsuccessful at best. And so when the contract became renewable, we had the opportunity to, he had the opportunity to broaden his involvement with an apparel company, and we took it as an opportunity to move beyond this partnership, because we did not want to pass on higher royalty rates to a small collection business within the stores. ", "So we believe it\u2019s best for both parties, and we\u2019re focused on our GO International and our Emerging Designer strategy. And we can very easily replace these four or five racks on our apparel floor in the small section that we had in accessories and footwear with these new emerging designers, which frankly have been very successful, and we've got a terrific portfolio of new emerging designers coming on-stream this year, which we'll share with you as the year progresses. Douglas Scovanner", "I would add to Gregg's comments regarding Wal-Mart that several of you on this call reached out to me last week after Wal-Mart's fourth quarter and full year release, seeking my comments on some facts that, if I have them straight, were passed along by Wal-Mart. I believe I was told that Wal-Mart's gross margin rate actually increased meaningfully in the fourth quarter, and that separately, I was told that it's a fact that Wal-Mart's advertising and marketing expense in the fourth quarter increased faster than sales.

Two questions; I'm just wondering if you could describe to us a little bit about the controls that you're putting in place to maintain the consistency in the store experience while you're cutting the payroll to adjust to the environment. And then secondly, on the credit card, maybe to address an earlier question, I was wondering, Doug, if you could give us an idea of what the reserve as a percentage of period-end receivables should look like as we trend through the next year. Robert UlrichIn terms of consistency of store experience, as I mentioned, and we have made major investments in logistics and distribution, we have better flow of merchandise to our stores, we have better technology in terms of scheduling our people, there are a wide array of things that allow us to pull down those hours and still deliver a branded experience for our guests and get them through the check lanes. Douglas Scovanner", "In terms of your question about looking forward on the allowance as a percentage of receivables, here at year-end of course it's 6.6%, there is some seasonality to that figure, but I would not expect it to change meaningfully as we move through 2008, with the sole exception of normal seasonality that makes some quarters naturally higher and lower than others. ", "Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ", "", "Would you (place) a range of let's say 6.5-7%, does that seem reasonable?Douglas ScovannerWell, part of what you're asking me to predict is what will the credit quality of the portfolio look like 12 months out, and clearly looking across the credit card industry, a lot of people misjudged that one when viewed from 12 months ago, so I think the range needs to be somewhat lighter than what you've just talked about, but generally centered around our current experience. Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, and then finally on the receivables growth, how should we think about that receivables growth, and when we move beyond the first half of this year, does it go back to perhaps a rate that's more in line with sales. What are you doing to change that behavior, if anything?Douglas ScovannerWell, I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the significant growth in a sequential manner is behind us. That means that as we move through the front half of 2008, the portfolio is not going to be growing even in line with sales on a sequential basis, but year-over-year, at least for the front half of the year, is virtually certain to exhibit growth in average receivables sharply ahead of our pace of sales growth. It becomes a bit more speculative as to what might happen in the back half of the year, because as you know, one of the key drivers this year is that we converted, or offered to our guests, the option to convert a very substantial number of our Target Guest Cards to having the higher credit limits and greater utility of Visa cards. ", "We'll make the judgment call later in 2008 as to whether we'll have a similar set of accounts or not, and if we do not, then year-over-year period-end receivables growth would likely be slower than sales, meaning that year-end 2008 receivables might not even increase as much as the 8% or 9% sales growth that I predicted earlier. So it all hangs in the balance of what we elect to do in 2008 in terms of making that offer to existing Target Card guests. Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.How much of that receivables growth in recent quarters has been driven by the product offering versus, let's say, existing card holders just accessing greater levels of credit or not paying down the receivables as quickly? ", "Douglas ScovannerMeaningful contribution from both, and there's also a cross-product, because the behavior of the accounts that were newly converted was to run out their open-to-buy to a greater extent much more quickly than similar cohorts of converted accounts in the past.

I was just hoping you could provide a comment of the owned food DC in Florida. Could you just update your thoughts in terms of self-distribution in food, the time frame, margin implications and perhaps the pace of private label penetration there? Gregg SteinhafelWe are evolving our supply-chain network in food, and as we've discussed, we are in the process right now of converting our first Supervalu food facility to a Target-dedicated facility. We'll open Lake City in the balance of the year. We will convert another Supervalu facility in the early part of '09, and then open a second Target-owned facility in the later half of '09. So we will have a hybrid network for the foreseeable future where we have both a dependence on our own facilities and a reliance on both Supervalu and our other wholesaler (CNM). So I would expect that over the next three or four years this would continue to evolve, and it's unlikely that we would handle all of our own perishable food distribution within a time frame earlier than four or five years. We believe that there is some gross margin upside in this type of conversion and so far, we are experiencing the levels of gross margin upside that we anticipated and expected when we made this investment in additional capital in our own facilities. So we're seeing the right kinds of offset to make the economics work. We've talked about adding about 200-300 basis points of owned brand food penetration on a per annual basis, and that's exactly what we experienced in '07, where we moved from about 15% or so, to just over 18% with the year-ended, and we will be into the 21%-ish range by the end of '08. So we remain committed to adding 200-300 basis points per annum.Adrianne Shapira - Goldman SachsGreat, Gregg, and this hybrid network shouldn't accelerate the pace of that penetration?Gregg SteinhafelNo, it won't accelerate the pace of our penetration at all. We think 200-300% is the appropriate level, and it's more dependent on how fast we initiate our own network versus using an outside third-party facility. Robert UlrichThe outside third-party facilities are also very capable of carrying our owned brand products, so that really isn't going to be different. Adrianne Shapira - Goldman SachsThank you.

And secondly, traditionally it's been a very tough balance for you all to balance between the fashion image and the price image. I'm wondering what your surveys are telling you about your pricing image with the customer, whether you're getting more traction with it this go around in the slowdown or not. Thank you so much.Robert UlrichOur research says that our pricing image is pretty much the same, and you have to recognize that there are some differences in certain categories - commodities, consumables, obviously, to get to looking for prices that are right on Wal-Mart's on like or similar items, as Gregg has said. In other categories, because we offer more fashion and more quality, the costs are higher, so the guests feel that, yes, we are higher-priced in categories like ready-to-wear, but they strongly prefer to shop there because they recognize the improved fashion and quality. Gregg Steinhafel", "With regards to your question on LCD or flat panel television, we're really not expecting a change in our gross margin rates. What essentially this is, is a conversion from analog to digital technology, and the gross margin differential in both the analog and flat panel LCD plasma technology is about the same when you fully allocate all the expenses and the competitive position of the marketplace. So there isn't going to be a material change there. Michael Exstein - Credit SuisseThanks a lot. OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory. Joe Feldman - Telsey AdvisoryHi guys, just a couple of quick ones. Can you comment on the regional trends through the quarter and any changes that you've seen throughout the quarter? We've been hearing more, obviously Florida, California have been weak, but we've heard it's really spread throughout the country, and wondering if you're seeing that as well. Robert UlrichWell, obviously the fourth quarter was softer than the third quarter, so on a macro basis, that's true. But there are certain parts of California, central and southern, and Florida, that would stand out in our minds as generally the weakest in the overall country. Joe Feldman - Telsey AdvisoryAnd then, also with regard to the call option that you guys are doing, or options; are there any tax benefits to doing that versus than just simple open market purchases?Douglas ScovannerNo, these are transactions in our own equity, and therefore there are no income tax implications to these transactions. This was simply a method to be able to capture the terrific benefits of share repurchase at a moment in time where we thought it would be imprudent to devote $1.5 billion of capital because of liquidity considerations. We had the ability to access the capital, but it would have rebalanced our risks in a way that we think would be inappropriate for an issue or with the kinds of credit ratings and profile that we have. Joe Feldman - Telsey AdvisoryAnd then one last one. We had heard that you guys are going to start maybe testing some new prototypes, maybe later this year or even in '09, and we're just wondering if you could make any comment on that, and what might be different about the stores that you're looking towards.Robert UlrichWe update our existing prototypes on an ongoing basis. We have evolutionary change in virtually every cycle of new stores, and then about every fifth year, we have a more substantive change. And the last major prototype initiative was in 2004, so we've been focused on our prototype evolution for end of this year and early '09, as we're just essentially calling it our '09 format. So it will be more evolutionary in nature compared to our '04 format change. And essentially the difference is, again, in slightly enhanced food presentation, we're making some architectural element changes, some visual element changes, but overall I would just basically tell you it will be a better version of the existing formats that you see today. At this point in time we have a chance for one more question from another analyst before we conclude the conference call.OperatorAnd your final question comes from the line of Todd Slater with Lazard Capital Markets.Todd Slater - Lazard Capital MarketsJust as to what thoughts you might have or be giving to the concepts of any international penetration. Thanks.Robert Ulrich", "As we've mentioned in the past, we still have an outstanding ability to well over double our sales in the US, and could potentially, virtually double our square footage, so we have very, very strong growth available here. We continue to monitor an international situation, and we feel we will be there at some point. ", "One could also look at the international situation and say that as Target is more focused on better-educated and more affluent higher demographic level guests, it would serve us well to be into some of these major emerging markets as they develop a stronger middle- and upper-middle class. So foreseeable future, still here, but monitoring externally - eventually we'll be there. ", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital MarketsThank you.Bob UlrichThat concludes Target's fourth quarter and year-end 2007 earnings conference call, and thank you all for your participation.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to Target Corporation's first quarter 2008 earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Gregg Steinhafel, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "", "Good morning and welcome to our 2008 first quarter earnings conference call. This morning I will share our view of the current economic and competitive environment and describe the implications of this retail marketplace to our strategy. Then Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review our 2008 first quarter financial results in greater depth and describe our outlook for the remainder of the year. Finally, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "Beginning next quarter when Kathee Tesija, our new Executive Vice President of Merchandising, joins us on these calls, she will provide updates on key merchandising initiatives as we have in the past. ", "This morning we announced our financial results for the first quarter 2008 which reflect the difficult overall sales climate that we and others are experiencing, but we are disappointed in our top line growth. We are pleased with the disciplined and consistent execution of our strategy, our effective management of expenses throughout the company, our continued market share gains, and our ability to achieve earnings per share in line with our expectations.", "We are also very pleased with the outcome of the receivables, ownership and capital structure review we initiated last September. Through our significant investment in share repurchase activity and the completion of our innovative agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase, we believe Target will generate substantial value for our shareholders over time.", "In recent months we have engaged in substantial share repurchase, reducing our share count by 8% in the past six months alone. While we have increased our debt to finance this activity, we are confident that shareholders will benefit from this more concentrated share ownership in Target stock as our pace of earnings growth and share price recover.", "As gas and food prices continue to rise and housing markets slow, consumers are facing increased financial pressure in reducing their spending, especially in discretionary categories. Many home furnishings and apparel retailers such as Kohl's, Macy's and J.C. Penney are experiencing comparable store sales declines in this environment, while retailers such as WalMart and Costco, with a significant portion of their assortment devoted to food and commodity items, are continuing to generate modest comparable store sales increases. ", "With our combination of high-frequency and fashion merchandise, Target's traffic trends in the first quarter were similar to WalMart's U.S. discount stores, while our comparable store sales growth reflected a slower pace due to the [40%] of our assortment in more discretionary categories. As Doug will describe in more detail, we expect this trend to continue in the second quarter as well.", "Our expect more, pay less brand promise continues to guide our strategy. In this climate, we have heightened our focus on our frequency driving businesses, including pharmacy, food and commodities and placed greater emphasis on the pay less side of our brand promise in our weekly circular, in-store signing and through greater use of value pricing on end cap displays. ", "In addition, we remain focused on delivering value by expanding our own brand presence across the store and working with our vendors to offset the rising costs of raw materials. We are also committed to ensuring our assortment reflects the appropriate balance of good, better, best offerings in order to give our guests highquality options at every price point.", "In addition to driving traffic and market share growth through most-have assortments, innovative merchandise and exceptional value, we are also intently focused on managing our inventories and being in stock. At the end of the first quarter, despite softer sales, inventories were in very good condition. As a result, we were able to improve gross margin rates within categories throughout the store even as we continued to experience the adverse mix impact of faster sales growth in lower margin categories.", "As we plan our business for the rest of the year, we are working closely with our vendors, pursuing opportunities to segment assortments based on volume and local preferences and carefully managing our inventory to control markdown risk and maintain intact reliability for our guests.", "Our [focus] on controlling the growth of our expenses also remain a top priority. Second only to the performance we experienced in the fourth quarter 2007, our first quarter growth in SG&A dollars of 6.2% was the lowest increase in more than 20 consecutive quarters. While we still experienced a very slight deleveraging in our expense rate in the quarter due to sales growth of only 5%, this excellent expense control is the result of efforts we initiated in the middle of last year as we recognized that consumer spending was beginning to slow. ", "We are proud of the progress we have made to date without compromising any key elements of our brand or service to our guests, and we expect our performance to continue to benefit from this companywide focus throughout the remainder of 2008.", "In addition, we continue to strategically invest in our business to increase efficiencies and optimize results, both in the current environment and more robust climates in the future. For example, we continue to improve our product design and development process to enhance quality, increase speed to market and ensure we are prepared to react quickly and efficiently. ", "We continue to develop our distribution network and exert greater control of the perishable food component of our supply chain with the opening of our first Target-owned semi-automated food distribution center in Lake City, Florida this fall, leading to higher food margins, improved freshness and continued rapid growth of our own food brand. ", "And we continued to invest in profitable new store growth. During the first quarter we opened a total of 26\u00a0new stores in 16\u00a0states, including 18\u00a0general merchandise stores and 8\u00a0SuperTarget locations. Net of closings and relocations, these openings bring our total store count at quarter end to 1,613 stores in 47 states. In July we will open approximately 43 new stores, adding about 35 new locations net of relocations and closings. ", "We are confident in the power of our strategy and the passion and experience of our team to lead Target through the consumer spending challenges we are facing in 2008. Through disciplined execution of core business operations, we will continue to enjoy profitable market share growth and reward our shareholders for many years to come.", "Now Doug will review our first quarter results, which were released earlier this morning.", "Douglas Scovanner", "", "Thanks, Gregg. As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via webcast. Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a Q&A session and John Hulbert and I will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow up questions you may have.", "Also, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings.", "In my comments this morning I plan to cover four topics. First, I'll review several financial reporting changes that we've implemented beginning with our first quarter 2008 filings. Next, I'll review key aspects of our first quarter performance in our newly established Retail and Credit Card segments. Then I'll discuss activity under our share repurchase authorization since year end. And finally, I'll share an updated outlook for our business in 2008.", "First, concurrent with the appointment of Gregg as our Chief Executive Officer, we engaged in a reevaluation of our reportable business segments. As a result of this review, this morning we began reporting results for two business segments, Retail and Credit Cards. This change reflects the way that Gregg and I and others in our management will evaluate our business results going forward. This move to twosegment reporting, along with the structure of our receivables transaction with J.P. Morgan Chase, will allow us to provide more clarity into the performance metrics we report on our Credit Card segment, which I'll discuss in more detail later.", "In addition, we're reclassified distribution and other supply chain costs in our Retail segment, moving them from SG&A expenses into cost of sales. This change was prompted by changes we've made to our supply chain processes and infrastructure primarily related to the development of our food distribution capabilities. This change has the analytical impact of creating equal reductions in both our gross margin and expense rates with no change to our retail segment operating margin rate.", "To provide context for our current reported results, we have reclassified prior period results to conform to these reporting changes and we've furnished these reclassified results by quarter for the last three years in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Now let's move to our first quarter results, which were announced this morning.", "As Gregg discussed earlier, our sales performance fell short of our expectations but our overall financial performance met those expectations with earnings per share of $0.74, down $0.01 to last year's first quarter. ", "In the current environment, we continue to see sales and traffic patterns that are significantly lower than we expect to enjoy in the longer term. Specifically, our total sales grew 5.0% in the quarter to $14.3\u00a0billion due to the contribution from new stores offset by a 0.7% decline in same-store sales. ", "Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes or EBIT decreased 2.2% to $959 million this year from $980 million in the first quarter of 2007. ", "Our first quarter gross margin rate declined 9 basis points from last year. As expected, our margin rate was adversely affected by mix, as sales of our lower margin consumable and commodity categories outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home categories. The magnitude of this mix impact was significant, just under 70\u00a0basis points, similar to our experience in the third quarter of 2007. Unlike that quarter, this larger than normal mix impact was largely offset in this quarter by higher margin rates within many categories across our assortment.", "Our Retail segment expense rate in the quarter increased 24 basis points over last year. Overall, this performance reflects strong control of the dollar growth in expenses, offset by the slight deleveraging effect of a relatively weak 5% sales growth in the quarter. In addition, some year-over-year expense unfavorability was related to the timing of certain items and some was related to annualizing the benefit to last year's rate of the $12 million federal excise tax refund. ", "Finally, our depreciation and amortization rate increased 17 basis points as dollar growth in these noncash expenses grew at a low double-digit pace in line with our expectations. This metric generally grows in line with capital investment, which we have grown over time at a similar low double-digit pace.", "Now I'll move to key results in our Credit Card segment. Consistent with our prior guidance, average receivables in the first quarter increased 28% over 2007, benefiting in part from the increase in receivables resulting from last year's product change in which we offered higher limit Visa cards to a group of our better and best credit quality Target cardholders. ", "Also as expected, period end receivables declined by about $200 million in the quarter from year end balances, reflecting a typical season pattern in conjunction with modest underlying account growth.", "The dollar yield on the portfolio, now measured as a spread to one-month LIBOR, increased modestly in the quarter from $132 million last year to $138 million this year. ", "As we've discussed in previous conversations, dollar yield on the portfolio is benefiting from the year-over-year increase in receivables, substantially offset by the reduction in the rate spread on those receivables. Specifically, the yield spread to LIBOR was 6.5 percentage points in the first quarter this year, down from 8.1\u00a0percentage points in 2007.", "Let me pause for a moment to explain these yield metrics as they differ from our prior use of pre-tax earnings as our yield measure for the portfolio. We have moved to a spread to LIBOR framework to analyze both dollar and rate performance since it is a key metric that we use to measure performance internally. As you know, the vast majority of our credit card receivables earn variable finance charge revenue tied to the prime rate. As a result, we fund the majority of these assets with floating rate funding. In summary, it's only appropriate to judge our credit card EBIT against a floating rate benchmark, and one-month LIBOR is the benchmark against which the vast majority of our floating rate funding reprices, including our $3.6 billion transaction closed yesterday with J.P. Morgan Chase.", "This new framework also allows us to analyze the pre-tax return on credit card receivables funded by Target separately from the yield on receivables funded by third parties. Our first quarter reporting shows that the return on receivables funded by Target fell from 16.5% in the first quarter of 2007 to 11.5% in the 2008 period, reflecting the decline in our yield spread to LIBOR as well as the fact that Target was funding a larger percent of receivables at the end of the first quarter this year compared to last year. In the second quarter and beyond, we expect that our pre-tax ROIC on Target's residual investment in this portfolio will increase sharply as a direct result of our transaction with J.P. Morgan Chase. ", "Finally, as expected, net write-offs in the first quarter increased substantially from an annualized 6.0% in the first quarter of 2007 to 7.6% this year. This year-over-year change is largely explained by two factors, first, the unsustainably strong performance in this metric in last year's first quarter, and next, increased write-offs activity concentrated in four states that have been particularly affected by housing-related weakness:  Florida, Arizona, Nevada and California.", "Turning back to our consolidated financial statements, net interest expense for the quarter increased by $65\u00a0million over last year, reflecting substantially higher debt balances slightly offset by lower funding costs. Our higher balances this year are the result of significant investment in both our Retail and Credit Card segments in addition to robust share repurchase activity during the last four quarters. Specifically, we have invested more than $9\u00a0billion in capital investment, credit card receivables growth and share repurchase over those four quarters.", "Our effective tax rate was 37.1% in the quarter, down over a percentage point from the first quarter last year due to the resolution during the quarter of specific tax uncertainties. We expect that there will continue to be variability between our individual quarterly and full year effective tax rates as tax uncertainties arise and are resolved. Generally accepted accounting principals require us to reflect these discrete tax matters in the quarter in which they occur. For the full year 2008, we now expect our effective tax rate to lie in the range of 37.5% to 38.5%. ", "Now let's turn our attention to our recent share repurchase activity. As you know, in November of 2007 we announced a new $10 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our prior program. At the time we said that under the right combination of business results, liquidity and share price that we would expect to complete half or more of this new program by the end of 2008, and we've made significant progress toward that expectation since year end.", "In the first quarter we purchased 30.5 million shares, investing approximately $1.6 billion. This equates to a weighted average price of $51.55 per share. These amounts include 10 million shares that were repurchased as the result of exercise of the first of three sets of options acquired in derivatives transactions executed in the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "In addition, since the end of the first quarter we've retired another 10 million shares as the result of exercising options acquired in the second series of derivatives transactions, for a total investment of just over $500 million in the past two weeks.", "As Gregg mentioned, in the six months since the beginning of this program we have retired just under 8% of our outstanding shares. We continue to believe that current share price levels provide a unique opportunity to concentrate ownership which we strongly believe will benefit our shareholders over time as our growth rate and share price recover from current levels. ", "Let's turn to our outlook for 2008. Ninety days ago we discussed that in our Retail segment we were expecting sales growth for the year to increase in the 8% to 9% range, reflecting the continued contribution from new stores and an expected comparable store sales increase in the range of 2% to 3%. At that time we said that this outlook explicitly assumed that our sales growth would be much better in the second half of the year as we cycle our softer sales results of the second half of 2007, especially in the fourth quarter.", "We continue to believe that this is the likely pattern that our sales growth will follow, yet our softer than expected first quarter sales performance has caused us to adopt a more conservative approach to our near-term sales outlook. In short, our top line growth will likely remain sluggish until we see some stability or improvement in the economic environment.", "Consistent with our guidance provided at the end of the last quarter, we continue to expect a slight to modest operating margin rate decline in our Retail segment for the full year 2008, driven by a similar degree of gross margin rate deterioration, with an expense rate expected to remain generally in line with 2007. ", "In the next several quarters, we'll likely continue to experience mixed pressure on our gross margin rate, and without the offsetting rate benefit with categories to the same extent that we enjoyed in the first quarter. The good news is that we continue to expect to offset most of this gross margin rate pressure through effective control of our expenses.", "In our Credit Card segment we continue to be pleased with how well we're performing in a very harsh credit environment. We expect 60-day delinquency rates to remain stable throughout 2008 at recent levels in the range of 4%. And our net write-offs as a percentage of average receivables for the year are likely to lie in the range of 7% to 8%, with the second quarter near the high end of this annual range followed by modest sequential improvement in the fall.", "Overall portfolio yields will likely remain at industry leading levels, although not at the record level set in 2007. More specifically, we continue to expect that the dollar spread to LIBOR on the portfolio for the full year will increase as the profitability associated with increases in receivables is only partially offset by a decline in the yield spread. Our quarterly pattern of profit growth, however, will not be smooth, with much better year-over-year performance in the third and fourth quarter than in the second quarter. ", "Our second quarter challenge, by the way, is due in part to the fact that last year's spread to LIBOR was the best in our history. ", "In addition, beginning with the second quarter, the impact of the J.P. Morgan Chase transaction, together with the $1.9\u00a0billion of previously securitized receivables, will result in Target providing only about one-third of the overall capital invested in our credit card receivables portfolio while still enjoying the benefit of about twothirds of the profit. In summary, this means our return on Target's invested capital is expected to be sharply higher in the second quarter and beyond than it was in the first quarter, even at a time when the short-term performance of the portfolio is facing obvious headwinds.", "Finally, we expect to continue to create significant long-term value by executing share repurchase under the program announced last November. In particular, I continue to expect that under the right combination of operating results, liquidity and share price, we will execute half or more of the $10 billion program by the end of 2008.", "Overall we've tried to provide ample color surrounding the performance outlook of our business segments in the current environment. In summary, we believe that the current median First Call EPS estimates for the full year 2008 of $3.47 lies within a reasonable range of potential outcomes, although our internal outlook for the second quarter is somewhat softer than the current median First Call EPS estimate of $0.79.", "Now Gregg will provide some final comments. Gregg?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "While the current climate poses challenges to our near-term pace of growth, our strategy is sound. We are keenly focused on superior execution and our team remains committed to delivering the constant flow of innovative and well-designed merchandise and an exceptional value that our guests expect from Target. As a result, we believe that Target is well positioned to grow profitability in this economic and competitive environment, and we feel confident that Target will continue to deliver substantial value for our shareholders over time.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Now Doug and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup. ", "There is no response from her line. Your next question comes from Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets", "", "Doug, I had a credit question and then a store question. Can you talk a little bit about the delinquency and default rates on those converted accounts that you did and how that's trending, and what percent of those accounts are in Florida and California?", "And then Gregg, if you could speak to a little bit about the relationship with J.P. Morgan. There's the financing piece, but can you talk a little bit about how you're going to use that to drive revenues, specifically in the electronics department where you don't really have a deferred financing program to compete with the Best Buys and so on. Do you anticipate putting together a program like that?", "And then I had a store question.", "Douglas Scovanner", "I'll see if we can cover all of that. First of all, the accounts that were so-called product changed last year, which are responsible for a meaningful portion but not by no means all of our year-over-year accounts receivable growth, are following a very typical pattern relative to the many cohorts that preceded them of product changes, adjusted only for the fact that we're in a somewhat harsher credit environment. So the pattern of delinquencies and write-offs is somewhat higher than the higher two or three or four converted cohorts, but the pattern is virtually identical.", "Those converted accounts lie across geography proportionately to the rest of our portfolio, which means that both in those accounts and also in the portfolio that existed before those converted accounts, more or less 30% of our receivables lie in the four states I mentioned - Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona combined - and therefore 70%, of course, lie in the other 46 states. Our adverse experience in delinquencies and our adverse experience in write-offs is very, very heavily concentrated in those four states.", "With respect to the J.P. Morgan Chase relationship, I am looking forward in earnest to rolling up our sleeves, together with our credit card team here at Target and the team from Chase Card Services to find innovative ways that we can both improve the yield in our portfolio and also potentially improve the growth in that portfolio as well. ", "We just closed the transaction yesterday and I've been kind of busy overnight preparing for some other things, so we haven't made a lot of progress in the last 18 hours. But I don't intend for much time to pass before we get together and begin that work in earnest.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets", "And my store question, I guess, is a lot of companies have been curbing their store openings in light of the economic environment and maybe a secular slowdown. At what point in the year do you kind of reconsider your store openings for '09? You've got 116 or so this year, but at what point do you kind of think about curbing that a little bit, if at all, for the year, for next year actually.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We remain committed to opening approximately 90 to 100 net new stores that have been on a gross basis, say 110 to 120 over the last couple of years. And unless this slowdown in consumer spending is protracted and goes on for some length of time, we remain committed to the growth levels that we have described in the past, and we believe that it's appropriate for us to still grow at that 90 to 100 store mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan.", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "", "Doug, can you touch on the other categories a little bit more granular for us where you saw some strength to help offset the 70 bip increase in mix pressure?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Certainly. We had a number of things fall our way this quarter in a favorable sense to our original plans. First of all, I mentioned that in a number of merchandise categories across our assortments we enjoyed the benefits of a wider gross margin rate. And that went a very long way in this quarter toward offsetting the adverse sales mix pressure on gross margin rate.", "Separately, even though our expense rate was up a bit in the quarter, we clearly achieved more than 100% of what we set out to achieve in expense savings. ", "And finally, I would point out that in both the areas of our income taxes and in the effect of the timing of our share repurchase program, we benefited EPS as well. ", "So the collection of those four influences all in the positive direction more than offset in this quarter the adverse sales and related mix impact that we experienced", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "Let me just ask the question a different way, then. Which categories did you see a little bit of a wider GPM rate?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "", "Well, we saw expanded margin rates in more of our hard lines businesses than in home or apparel. Home and apparel were essentially flat between the two of those, and both our food business and our other hard lines category had slight margin rate expansion.", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "And then another one, Gregg, for you, just as you look to the back half, managing inventories, future receipts, can you give us sort of how you think of planning inventories for the back half of the year, either on a per square foot or per store basis?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yeah. We continue to take a very cautionary approach to our sales and receipt management, and until we see some underlying change in the environment and see a strengthening in the business, we're going to be very tough minded as it relates to the receipts that we bring in. ", "So we're going to stay focused on same-store sales in the range of what we have been experiencing in the first quarter until we get into the fourth quarter. We expect some uptick in the fourth quarter, but it's still going to be on the conservative side until we get a better feel for what the environment's going to be like.", "So, I mean, we've got a lot of average inventory in our network. We can absorb selling into our inventory without risking being out of stock in any category that's important to our guests.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Let me put a few numbers around that, if I may. At quarter end, our year-over-year growth in square footage was 9.0%. Our sales growth in the quarter was 5%, and our growth in inventories was right in the middle, about 7%. ", "So we're in great shape moving into the second quarter despite the softness in our sales.", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "And then one more, Gregg, for you - or Doug, for you - just on the interest expense line, $200\u00a0million, can you give us a sort of sense for what you think we should be thinking for the balance of the year? Obviously higher year-over-year, but either an absolute dollar number or basis point guidance?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, the rate is actually modestly favorable because, of course, fed funds at 2% today are sharply lower than they were at this point last year.", "A lot depends on the actual pace of our share repurchase program. That would be a good reason to increase interest expense. But I think with a broad brush on it, you can think maybe $900 million for this year, and obviously with wider than normal variation around that theme based on the pace of receivables growth and the pace of share repurchase that are clearly variables in the fall at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "", "In terms of, Doug, if we look at 2008 comps versus a year ago, if we look at a two-year stack, obviously it was negative in the first quarter. Is there anything that, as we look to the rest of the year, that we should think from a twoyear stack perspective that things would improve from here? ", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, the first quarter was negative this year, but certainly not negative in a two-year stack.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Right. The two-year stack was a 3.6, but you're facing a 4.9 in the second quarter and a 3.7 in the third. If we see the same trend, it would potentially indicate negative comps in the second and third quarter.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, I think that first of all we've already gone on record to tell you that May is likely to lie in the range of minus 1 to plus 1. There's nothing particularly unique about June and July combined that on an aggregate basis would lead me to expect something very different from flat plus or minus here in Q2.", "As we move into Q3 and Q4, a couple of things are very important analytically. First of all, even though our total sales in Q3, our total comps in Q3, last year were still quite strong, our comps in the higher-margin apparel and home categories were not. So in Q3, even though our reported comps may not be that strong, the underlying financial health of generating gross margin dollars year-over-year is not something I expect to be quite as challenging as Q2.", "Q4, by contrast, had much softer sales overall. In other words, the comp trends in home and apparel were about the same in Q4 as Q3, but the big difference was that in Q4 our sales growth in the lower margin categories cooled off a bit.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "", "And with regard to what you're seeing in May thus far, is that more related to what you're seeing with regard to seasonal businesses or any impact from the fiscal stimulus?", "Douglas Scovanner", "We have not historically in any recent times made any comments mid-month, and I don't think we should depart today. We'll give you a full color story on the month of May when we report our results in early June.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "And then, Gregg, you talked about the heightened focus on frequency driving businesses. Can you elaborate on that comment?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes. I mean, in this environment, we've been working hard to accentuate the pay less side of the brand promise. So it's the selection of merchandise we put on our end caps, making sure we have strong value messaging, that our circular messaging and print marketing has a much more dominant impact around price and savings and value in addition to what we typically would do in terms of differentiation and seasonal content.", "So we're just very mindful that the consumer is very cash strapped right now and is looking for good values. They're expecting more sale merchandise, and we are responding by ensuring that our assortments reflect their desires.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Can you also elaborate a bit in terms of your pharmacy business at the moment, some of the recent initiatives that you have embarked upon, and if that is also helping drive traffic to the store? ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Our pharmacy business continues to be very healthy. It has grown at double-digit same-store sales for a number of years, and this year is no exception. We continue to match Wal-Mart on price in their $4 generic and now their newly expanded $10 generic program for a 98-day supply.", "So we're very, very competitive in the business. We offer terrific service in both the Rx and OTC and other health care products within our stores. And it's been a good solid growth business for us, and we expect that to continue. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "Thank you. Gregg, just following up on your comments on the marketing message on the pay less, could you help us understand over the near term, with the fiscal stimulus checks heading out, what if any changes or what efforts you are enacting on the marketing front to perhaps gain a greater share of those checks?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, I think the best way to really look at the marketing message would be what is the point of sale messaging that you see in our stores, on our end caps, and then secondly, what is the message that we are conveying in our weekly circular that's delivered to 50-plus million households. And if you go through our circular you will see that we have a much stronger headline commitment speaking to value and savings, the way we've organized products, the way we've highlighted headlines, focused on value, how we've aligned our frequency businesses and created bigger, more dominant statements within that circular and calling greater attention to the pricing. ", "You compare the circular today versus a circular that we had published six months ago, you will see differences in the messaging, and you will see a much stronger narrative speaking to the value side of our brand promise.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "In light of that, could you just talk about, you had mentioned you believe you're appropriately positioned, sort of the good, better and best, but give us a sense of how customers are shopping. Are you seeing more of a trade down to the good category especially as you're highlighting the price emphasis?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're seeing some trade down throughout the store, and we're also seeing our guests not shop in the more expensive discretionary categories. So for example, in our seasonal business, which is seasonal lawn and patio, which is soft in every other retailer as well, we're seeing very robust growth in replacement businesses like seating and cushions and some of the accessory categories, but we're not doing well in sets. So the mix of those two still will generate same-store sales declines, but it's healthy in one part and it's not so healthy in the other side. ", "In our domestics business we're seeing terrific growth in our towel business and in our Valley of [Sheet] World, so people are coming in and they're buying replacement pillows and sheets, but they're not buying the entire ensemble of top of bed and shams and duvets along with their sheets.", "So it's more selective purchasing on the consumer's part.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Which takes a very careful analysis to interpret trading down. This is a shift of units more than a best to good kind of shift. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "And then, Gregg, just on the inflationary pressures, as we're heading into the back half maybe give us a sense across categories what you're planning, and given the obviously current challenging top line environment, how do you expect to deal with those pressures?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we'd love nothing better to have the inflationary pressures go away. As you know, more of the food and the consumables were the leading edge indicators of what was happening, and we've been experiencing some inflation in those businesses since the fourth quarter and throughout the first half of this year.", "As we move into the year we're seeing more inflation in those other discretionary categories where we typically haven't seen them in the past. So there is some slight inflation in apparel due to raw material costing out of China, transportation expenses and lack of subsidies. And then other categories such as home products, we're seeing greater levels of inflation in the higher single digit and low single digit, and our response has always been to work with our suppliers so that we don't have to accept them or we can delay them or we can accept a smaller portion of them. But if they do come to us and we have to accept them, which in some cases we do, we're looking to pass those along in the marketplace as a matter of last resort. ", "But we're planning on increasing retails in those businesses where we have to absorb some of these price increases.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "So just to be clear, in home about 9% to 11% and apparel more in the low single digits, is that their range?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, I would say apparel is in the very low single digit. It's a couple of percent. But that's up from a deflationary environment in the past. And I wouldn't say that all of home categories are in the 9% or 10%. I'd say there are some selected categories that have greater pressure than others. I would say in general it might be in the 5% to 8% range, the high end being in the 9%, 10%, 11%. In some categories it's in the 2% or 3%. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "And then just lastly, Doug, just on the 30 million in terms of the exercising of the options, it sounds like there's another 10 million to go. I think on the last call you had mentioned you would expect to exercise the options in April through June, so should we expect the remainder to be completed in the second quarter?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Yes. As we disclosed in our 10-K, there were three series of derivatives with expirations in April, May and June respectively. So what we've said today is that we have exercised all of the options with respect to the first two series, and the final series - which is reflective of the option to purchase 10 million shares, precisely 10\u00a0million shares\u00a0\u00a0expire on various dates in June. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "", "Gregg, I just wanted to go back and revisit the margin gains or expansion that you achieved in the first quarter in the nondiscretionary categories again just to be clear. You were able to negotiate some better margins with some of your hard lines products. Could you go a little bit further into that, and was that the result of negotiating different terms with the vendors? It sounds like it might not continue at that pace based on Doug's comments. Can you put that in context of the source of that and why it wouldn't continue or how it was negotiated?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Sure. Let me go through the story in general.", "In both soft lines and homes, we were thrilled with the margin rate performance in the first quarter in spite of those categories being especially hard hit. We managed their receipts very well in those categories, so our clearance markdowns were lower than prior years and we were able to maintain good strong initial markups.", "We also had markdown favorability in our hard lines categories as just part of our ongoing initiatives to be smarter in how we invest our promotional markdowns, manage our mix, manage our clearance markdowns, and pass along some of the price increases that we've received while maintaining the same margin rates. We've had some slight expansion in some of those categories. Not all categories, but enough categories to move the needle in the hard lines businesses.", "So overall it was a good combination of effort throughout the store to offset the majority of the mix deterioration with some margin rate expansion. ", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "So it was more of an inventory management as opposed to some new negotiations with your vendors?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, it was clearly inventory management on the home and apparel side. It was the combination of things that I mentioned on the hard lines side. It's also a continuation of our emphasis to build our own brand, both in food and nonfood categories. And as you know, they hold or carry significantly higher margins than the national brands and our food brand penetration continues to grow. And our hard lines brand penetration is growing as well, and so that helps mitigate some of the margin rate pressure and gives us some expansion capability.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "And would you expect that environment in general in balance to continue through the rest of the year, those different offsetting factors on gross margin?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're hopeful. I mean, we're planning our business cautiously and provided that the competitive environment remains rational and stable like it is today, I mean, it's still very competitive but we have been able to pass through some of these cost increases in the marketplace. And if that continues throughout the year and we're able to manage our business as we have and invest wisely, it's our every intention to be able to manage the gross margin rate deterioration to traditional levels.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "In terms of pharmacy being a strong business for you comp wise and a traffic driver, as you look at it in terms of basket analysis, you know, where you have a pharmacy transaction versus where you don't or the chain average, what are you seeing in terms of the mix of that basket? Is it favorable in terms of the overall transaction size, the margin mix? What is it driving in your store in terms of other sales?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Like our Red Card baskets, the pharmacy guest at Target's a very important guest to us. They visit us more frequently than the average guest, and their baskets in general are larger than the typical transaction at Target.", "Douglas Scovanner", "It's hard to determine precise cause and effect, but there's a very high correlation across a lot of traits, as Gregg mentioned. A pharmacy guest tends to visit the store a lot more often. Only a subset of those trips include pharmacy purchases.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "", "First, can you talk about the comp trends in the SuperTarget stores versus the Target stores? And Gregg, can you elaborate a little bit more on the trend in the apparel business, what's working, what's not? And are you changing any square footage allocation in the categories that are struggling a bit in the stores today?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes. Comp trends in SuperTarget and a general merchandise store, give or take, are very consistent with one another, plus one month, minus a little. But on average, for some period of time now, they've been within a very close range with one another.", "And I'd love to be able to tell you that there's a lot of exciting trends in apparel right now, but we'd settle for some positive same-store sales growth in any one of our apparel divisions. Our Converse launch has been successful to date, in both genders and in every category, so we're really pleased with that business. And then there are, you know, selected businesses that are doing slightly better than others. Our performance active wear business and intimate apparel is doing exceptionally well this year. Our footwear business is pretty healthy this year.", "And so as the weather is turning and we're starting to see a more traditional pattern, we're starting to see some better trends in apparel and footwear than we've seen early in the year. ", "But overall it's still a business that's discretionary in nature and under some pressure, like you're hearing from the other retailers.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Curiously, we continue to gain a lot of market share in those categories despite the current environment, maybe even because of the current environment.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "And are you changing, in terms of the square footage allocation, are you cutting back on any areas in the store?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Not in a meaningful way. Our prototypes evolve and every new cycle we constantly make small adjustments to our businesses. And our Apparel World is and has been fairly consistent over time.", "We've made some slight modifications, strengthening our presence in ladies and kids and infant and toddlers, and we've edited down some space in footwear and men's. But there hasn't been any significant changes, and we don't really anticipate changes in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "", "I have two questions. First, Gregg, I wanted to get a little deeper on the buy for the third quarter and second half. It sounds like you guys are being cautious, and the way I'm reading that is maybe buying for a one or two comp in the third quarter. And how late, given your lead times now, do you have to decide what you buy for the fourth quarter?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, let me take your second question first. We're basically at that time of year that we're finalizing or getting close to finalizing our purchases and sales for the balance of the year. ", "As Doug mentioned, we had three quarters last year of pretty decent sales growth in the mid-3 plus range in Q1, Q3; a little stronger in Q2. So we're planning those businesses in total, give or take, around flat with greater on the consumable and food side of the business and softer sales in apparel and home.", "As we think about fourth quarter, we think there will be some rebound in sales due to the fact that last year was a flat quarter. So we're not expecting mid-digit comps, but we're hopeful that we should be able to deliver a low single-digit comp during the fourth quarter, and we're planning our purchases to reflect that type of sales environment.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "", "And then within that are we assuming - it sounds like inflation in that low single-digit comp is going to be up a couple hundred basis points than it would have been in the first or second quarter.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we calculate that on a storewide basis at the end of October every year. Last year it was slightly deflationary, which was a combination of more deflation in some of our hard lines categories like electronics, and then slight inflation in other categories. It really remains to be seen where it shakes out because there's both inflationary and deflationary pressures throughout the store. ", "I would say on average there's slightly more inflationary pressures this year, but it's really too hard to tell what that will really mix out by the time we get to the end of October and the balance of the year.", "Douglas Scovanner", "I think you're on the right path, though, Greg. Clearly, food categories right now need a lot of careful interpretation as to our comps or anybody else's comps. CPI measured food inflation April this year versus last year is nearly plus 6. So anybody that's running less than plus 6 in food is either experiencing some trading down in units or a reduction in unit sales. ", "Apparel, by sharp contrast, year-over-year was slightly negative as measured by the CPI April versus same point year ago. It wouldn't surprise me if that CPI measure of apparel goes slightly to modestly positive by the time we get into the - toward the end of this year. And of course, we end up having a very strong market share in units and continue to grow market share in apparel categories in this environment.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And then a follow up, Doug, just to make sure I'm getting the credit yields right on the new way you're reporting. In the past you've talked about a 7% yield, give or take, for this year. Is that a little bit lower now using LIBOR as the cost?", "Douglas Scovanner", "We could provide a detailed reconciliation of the old method versus the new method offline with anyone who's interested, but overall as I look across the rest of the year by as much coincidence as coincidence - let's try that in English - I think that generally speaking for the year that\u2019s not a bad assumption. I don't think 7.00 but range 7% as opposed to 6% or 8%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "", "I wonder if you can please give me some color on SG&A. I wonder if you could highlight which of the line items were experiencing some deleverage and which ones were benefiting from the strong cost control?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I'm going to approach that question in two ways. Our strong cost controls yielded lower expenses in dollars across all categories than our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. That's great news. The bad news, of course, is that we missed our sales plan by an even larger percentage, and so we deleveraged slightly.", "Looking forward, I expect to continue to enjoy the benefits of a very broad-based expense control program in dollars and to a significant enough extent that unless sales get worse I would expect even better rate performance year-over-year for the balance of the year than we enjoyed in the first quarter.", "A lot of individual items in any quarter - timing issues, issues in the base and so forth - so I don't mean to sound like there's a litany of excuses for a bit of rate deterioration in Q1, but as we sort through those issues looking forward, I don't think we're likely to see that kind of rate deterioration for the balance of the year. And that will go a long way toward offsetting those mix-related pressures in gross margin rate that we've talked about.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Doug, could you please be a little bit more specific on how the labor scheduling is working out in the stores?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I don't know what you mean by a little more specific on labor scheduling. What aspect of labor scheduling would you like me to focus on?", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "Just in general, on how successful you've been in keeping labor costs in check at the store level.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well we have for quite some time had an excellent tool for scheduling. This is not a new issue, Q4 last year or Q1 this year. We have been quite adept over the last two quarters. Those two quarters in particular have shown remarkable productivity gains in contrast to the kinds of productivity performance that we turned in over the prior several years. ", "These are basic issues of trying to get our labor in balance as best we can with the pace of sales, and we have been quite adept at that, importantly, without sacrificing any guest service standards. And we are religious - perhaps even fanatic\u00a0 about measuring guest service standards in each and every store, each and every month.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Let me just add, Uta, that we've invested heavily in technology in the past in productivity saving measures, and some of those investments we have made in mobile technology in our store and in our supply chain are driving these productivity improvements in our stores as well. ", "So it's a combination of just good discipline and the productivity that we're getting from good investments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Virginia Genereux - Merrill Lynch.", "Virginia Genereux - Merrill Lynch", "", "I've got three quick ones. Doug, I'm surprised that your interest expense would be even as low for the year as you're talking about considering the January offering and the J.P. Morgan deal. Are there any gains on debt repurchase or hedging unwinds that are in there? And can you also tell us how much of the $17 billion debt balance is effectively floating? ", "Douglas Scovanner", "First of all, there's nothing tricky or mysterious one level under the surface. I would point out that we disclosed as a subsequent event in our 10K - and I'm happy to go through this in any level of detail that anyone would care to\u00a0 that we unwound over $3\u00a0billion worth of our interest rate swaps subsequent to year end early in Q1. And we collected $160\u00a0million in cash from the various counterparties involved in those transactions, and that will amortize in the normal course a little over $40 million as a credit against interest expense for the year. In essence you should think of that as having fixed some of the variability in a $3 billion portion of our floating rate debt.", "Stepping back to answer your second question, generally speaking, over time we maintain floating rate exposure equal to or slightly greater than our floating rate asset base of card receivables. At the moment, depending on how you think about that $3 billion worth of debt where we at least temporarily removed the hedges, quite literally our debt today is not responding to floating rates at that same pace as our assets, but I have an expectation that over time we're likely to put some if not all of those hedges back on.", "By the way, the $160 million we collected, had we waited until today to unwind those same derivatives, we would only collect in the range of $100 million, not $160. So clearly, our timing has been quite good in hindsight.", "Virginia Genereux - Merrill Lynch", "You earned your salary this year, Doug. And secondly, you were good enough to tell us what percent of the receivables were, I think, in those four - what percent of the credit receivables were in those four trouble states. Can you tell us what percent of the accounts that were converted from Red Card to Visa sort of last spring were in those four states?", "Douglas Scovanner", "About the same percentage. We did not discern by geography to offer our guests the opportunity to have us change their products. So it was in the same 30% range. ", "Virginia Genereux - Merrill Lynch", "", "And then just for you, Gregg, the SG&A, I think at one point you said most of the SG&A sort of cost initiatives would be sort of realized by the second quarter. And did you achieve some of those quicker than you thought in the first quarter, or is that still the timing that's enabling you to control this SG&A so well?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, as Doug said, we expect the SG&A gains to continue throughout the second quarter and the balance of the year, so this is not accelerating forward into Q1 gains that we were expecting to achieve in Q2 that we will now not be able to accomplish. I mean, we have a very disciplined approach to SG&A the entire year. The entire enterprise is doing a marvelous job focusing on expenses, and we expect that same kind of performance throughout all of '08. ", "Virginia Genereux - Merrill Lynch", "And even at a slower rate, I would expect, based on - a slower growth rate, I would expect, based on your comments because it was a tough compare against a year ago because you had deferred this spending and opened fewer doors. I mean, considering that, I think your rate of SG&A dollar growth, if it was 6 this quarter and high 5s even adjusted for the excise tax, Doug, that the rate of growth in absolute dollars is going to slow further. ", "Douglas Scovanner", "Or the pace of sales will increase from 5.0% overall given the fact that we now have 9% year-over-year growth in our immature square footage.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "", "It sounds like the category improvements that you saw or gross margin in categories that you saw, some of it was more inventory management, some was more structural and the trade down on private label or maybe a greater percentage of private label. I'm just curious if you can give us an update on what the private label mix is in food and general merchandise today.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "", "Well, in the store in total it is somewhere in the 35% to 40% range. It depends upon how you define private label and whether you're doing exclusive signature national brands like we have Eddie Bauer and a Converse brand. But I think 35%, 40% is a pretty good range. ", "We continue to add 200 to 300 basis points per year in food, and I expect this year to be no different than what we've achieved in the past so we should be pushing the 20% range by the end of this year.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "And was there an especially exaggerated mix in the second quarter that allowed for the better gross margins versus what you're expecting for the full year?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Not at all. Actually it was more adverse related due to the softness in both apparel and home.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "And then just as a point of clarification, did you say that the SuperTarget stores were trending comp-wise similar to the regular?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, I did. Yes.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "Is that surprising, I guess, given the food, the high food - and, I suspect, heavier traffic as a result\u00a0 I guess I would have expected that store to be trending maybe a little bit better.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "No, I think there is, first of all, there's a stronger food component in all of our general merchandise store. And secondly, our SuperTargets are in very, very competitive markets. A greater share of our SuperTargets are directly competing against Wal-Mart Super Centers than our general merchandise stores. So we believe that environment, that food environment, is slightly more competitive.", "But overall, it's very similar between the general merchandise store and a SuperTarget.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "And then, lastly, on the value message, while it's not clear whether this consumer downturn will last more than another nine months, if it were and as we progress through the year it becomes clearer that there's greater streams, would you imagine that Target could step up the level of value message with more perhaps onetime sale events or a greater message on that side?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Our strategy has been and continues to be expect more, pay less. We put a greater emphasis on pay less. I don't really see us ever doing things that would undermine the long-term brand attributes that we've been trying to build over a long period of time.", "So we're not about to embark on things like one-day sales or mid-week ROP advertising on hot commodities or things like that. I just - and we don't, as a leadership team - believe that's in our best long-term interest. We're going to continue to focus on what we do best, and that is delivering a superior guest experience, having innovative merchandise freshly brought into our stores, and we'll focus on the value. And in this environment, we're going to focus a little bit more on the value. But we're not going to skew the expect more, pay less brand promise to an inappropriate level.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "That concludes Target's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2008 earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Good morning and welcome to our 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. This morning I will provide a brief update on our strategy, operations, and outlook in the context of the current economic and competitive environment. Then Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will share the highlights from our 2008 second quarter financial results and describe our financial outlook for the second half of the year. Following Doug, Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising, will discuss a number of our key merchandising initiatives as we head into the fall season, and finally we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. ", "Overall, we were quite pleased with the execution of our strategy and the financial performance in the second quarter, though we continue to face many of the same macro challenges we and other retailers have experienced since the middle of last year, including credit burdened consumers, declining housing valuations, unprecedented oil prices, and rising inflation, especially in food. We remain confident in our strategies, in the dedication of our team and in our ability to operate effectively and grow market share profitably, even in this difficult economy. ", "To minimize the impact of these economic pressures on our guests, we remain keenly focused on thoughtfully delivering on our expect more, pay less brand promise. During the second quarter, we continued to benefit from an increase in average transaction size, driven by higher average retail price per unit. But this advantage was offset by a decline in the number of average trips our guests made to our stores, as well as the decrease in the number of categories they visited while shopping in our stores. ", "Our largest comparable store traffic declines were recorded in discretionary spending categories like home and apparel, consistent with broader industry trends. As a result, we have significantly increased our emphasis on communicating our value message through our marketing, in-store signing, and merchandise presentation, and we also remain firmly committed to delivering the newness, innovative design, and exceptional quality that Target is known for.", "In a few minutes, Kathy will provide more detail about our efforts in each of these areas. ", "To drive profitability in a slow sales environment, we are carefully investing in merchandise inventories to simultaneously drive sales, reduce markdown risk, and maintain reliable in-stocks for our guests. To accomplish these seemingly conflicting priorities, we continue to extend our segmentation strategy across our stores and assortments. This initiative allows us to effectively and efficiently customize our merchandise assortment, timing, presentation, and space based on the sales volume of individual stores and local preferences. For example, in our back to school business, we manage our transition timing to accommodate different school start dates, maximizing regular sales and minimizing markdowns, and we use different presentation approaches in high volume stores versus low volume stores to avoid over-stocks and unnecessary mark-downs. ", "We are encouraged by the results of this initiative and expect it to continue to contribute significantly to our margin results. ", "In addition, we continue to thoughtfully control the growth of expenses throughout the company without comprising our commitment to our guests or any key elements of our brand. And we are capitalizing on the opportunity in our share price to engage in substantial repurchase, which we believe will generate significant value for our shareholders over time. ", "In addition to share repurchase, we continue to invest strategically in both our supply chain and new store growth. The expansion of our distribution network continued this month with the opening of our first Target owned semi-automated food distribution center in Lake City, Florida, and we\u2019re on track to open our Cedar Falls, Iowa facility in 2009. ", "Our self-distribution strategy allows us to exert greater control over the perishable food component of our supply chain, resulting in improved freshness, higher food margins, and continued rapid growth of our owned brand foods. ", "During the second quarter, we opened a total of 43 new stores, including 30 general merchandise stores and 13 Super Target locations. Net of closings and relocations, these openings bring our total store count at quarter end to 1,648 stores in 47 states. In October, we plan to open approximately 45 new stores, adding about 35 net new locations. ", "As part of our October cycle, we are very excited to be opening our first two stores in Alaska and we look forward to expanding in this market, as well as entering Hawaii in 2009. ", "Speaking of 2009, we are modestly reducing our expected store openings for the coming year as a result of the difficulties developers are facing in the current environment and the discipline of our own capital investment approval process. This change is the result of our strong belief that delivering superior financial returns serves our long-term best interests better than adhering to a specified store opening program. Doug will provide additional details in a few minutes. ", "The current environment is the harshest we have seen in many years and with inflation growing at its fastest pace in close to two decades, we do not see any indication of meaningful near-term improvement. However, we remain confident that our unique merchandise offering of differentiation and value, our disciplined execution, and our strategic deployment of capital effectively positions us for long-term profitable growth. ", "Now, Doug will share the financial highlights from our second quarter results. ", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Thanks, Greg. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via webcast. Also, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings. ", "This morning I\u2019ll review with you two key challenges we face in the current environment and three separate areas in which we are exceeding our expectations. Each of these five issues had an impact on the quarter just ended and a better understanding of each is vital to any analysis of our likelihood to deliver shareholder value in 2008 and well beyond. I\u2019ll wrap up my remarks with specific guidance on future capital investment and EPS. As always, following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll conduct a Q&A session and John Hulbert and I will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. ", "The pace of sales growth in our retail segment continues to be our number one challenge in this environment. For the last three quarters, Target's comparable sales growth has hovered slightly above or below zero, with same-store traffic down 1% to 2%, offset by a similar rate of increase in average transaction size. Specifically for the second quarter, our comparable store sales were down 0.4% from 2007 and for the first half of the year, our comparable store sales are down 0.6%. ", "This comparable store sales performance puts us in the middle of the pack in the U.S., clearly slower than most competitors who have a higher concentration of their sales mix in inflationary consumable and commodity items, and well ahead of most competitors with a higher concentration of their sales mix in home and/or apparel items. ", "While this relative performance evaluation provides valuable context, the fact is that our current sales performance places a great deal of stress on our ability to maintain or improve retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates, and more important to deliver appropriate dollar growth and profits. ", "As we look across the next several quarters, sales growth will be the number one factor in determining our overall performance. If the current tepid pace of top line growth continues for the rest of the year, our near-term performance will continue to fall short of our long-term expectations. Alternatively, as we begin to cycle softer prior period sales performance later in the year, we may find year-over-year dynamics to be somewhat less challenging. ", "In the near-term, our second-largest challenge lies in the performance of our credit card portfolio. Here we continue to be adversely affected by the macro environment in which we and all other owners of similar credit quality portfolios operate. While our profit and return profiles continue to outperform those of most others in this business, the fact is that our write-off trends are modestly weaker than even we expected earlier in the year. Specifically, our annualized net write-off rate was 8.7% in the quarter, higher than the projected 7% to 8% rate for the year that we previously disclosed. ", "As a result, we added to our reserves in the quarter to provide for our exposure to the potential for these rates to remain at elevated levels in the near-term. ", "As most of you are already aware, we and others have responded to these challenges through a combination of terms changes to existing cardholders, combined with aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting. ", "Balanced against these two challenges, we continue to be very pleased with three separate aspects of our execution, each of which is important to our delivery of value for the rest of this year and well beyond. ", "First, our supply chain performance and especially our control of inventory flow continue to be exemplary. This quarter was the fourth in a row in which we were flat or down in comparable store sales in most of our markdown sensitive apparel and home categories. Even though these categories represent over 40% of our sales, we again avoided corrosive clearance markdowns through highly effective management of these variables. Our mix of sales, not our fashion risk, has been the biggest challenge to our gross margin rate, representing about a 60 to 70 basis point effect in the quarter and year-to-date. And I believe sales mix will continue to represent a bigger challenge than markdowns in the future as well. ", "This quarter also demonstrates the continued benefit of our successful efforts to control the growth rate of our expenses. This initiative, which began in earnest more than a year ago, led to remarkable performance in the second quarter. In fairness, I think the year-to-date expense rate trends are more reflective of underlying performance than either of the first two quarters in isolation. But so far this year, we have well exceeded our expectations on controlling expenses in the current environment. ", "As we move forward, some quarters will naturally look better or worse than others because of timing issues but clearly we have demonstrated that we have the will to control our destiny in this arena and have the ability to execute without jeopardizing guest service or in-stock levels, which remained strong as well. ", "In addition to those two operating items, trading in our common stock has created a unique opportunity for us to retire more shares than we expected to retire, and at prices that we believe will prove to be a great value over time. As you know, we announced a plan last November designed to allow us to retain strong credit ratings and also retire up to $10 billion of our common stock over approximately three years. In just nine months, we\u2019ve already retired about 11% of our outstanding shares, due in part to reduced share price over this short-term period. I\u2019ll help you with some math here. ", "Even without further share repurchase activity, the growth in operating results over time, which otherwise would have increased our EPS by $1, will now increase it by more than $1.12 and counting. ", "Now let\u2019s turn our attention to our new store plans and more broadly, capital investment as well. As you know, Target engages in a rigorous capital investment approval process in which we analyze proposed new stores one at a time, weighing the required incremental investment against the store\u2019s ability to create incremental cash flow for the company over time. ", "In 2008, this process will allow us to add about 90 to 95 net new stores, each of which we expect will produce handsome financial returns over time. For 2009, we currently project that we will add about 70 to 75 net new stores, while continuing to meet our unchanged expectations for future financial returns at the individual store level. This reduction in store count is driven by two main factors; first, many of our external development partners have experienced challenges in obtaining funding and/or filling in-line space in certain large power center projects that were anticipated to open in 2009. Separately, in the current sales environment, our process of underwriting new stores one at a time is working exactly the way it was designed. Specifically, in some cases our freshest site specific sales forecasts no longer product sufficiently high financial returns to merit proceeding with the project at this time. This process is especially valuable in light of even more attractive share repurchase dynamics in the near term. ", "In summary, as we have always done, we elect to build individual stores only when we believe we will enjoy sufficient financial returns. In the long-term, I believe this is quite unlikely to change our ultimate store count in the U.S. market. ", "Translating into dollars, we would now estimate our overall capital investment to lie in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion in each of 2008 and 2009, or about $1 billion lower than our earlier thinking over this two-year period. ", "And finally, a few observations on EPS; as you know, our diluted EPS for the second quarter exceeded the expectation that we laid out 90 days ago. On the positive side of things, we enjoyed better-than-expected retail operating margin performance and the P&L benefit of settling some income tax matters in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by modestly weaker sales than we anticipated and higher write-offs, leading in turn to higher reserves in our credit card segment. ", "Looking forward, we think it\u2019s prudent in the near-term to maintain a cautious outlook. For example, our pace of back-to-school sales has been quite volatile. Through the first 10 days of the fiscal month of August, our sales pace was much softer than expected. In contrast, our sales have been healthier since then. This elevated volatility makes it more difficult to develop near-term forecasts which are as reliable as we are used to. Nevertheless, for the full year 2008, the current first call median EPS estimate for Target is $3.43. We think this lies in a reasonable range of likely outcomes, although we are more comfortable in our ability to achieve fourth quarter EPS expectations than we are in the third quarter. ", "There are three principal reasons for this comment regarding the split between third quarter and fourth quarter earnings. First, we are more likely to enjoy stronger same-store sales in the fourth quarter because of last year\u2019s base. Next, we will certainly enjoy a much larger EPS benefit of our share repurchase activity in that quarter. And finally, this year\u2019s fourth quarter is the first full quarter of the substantial financial benefits we\u2019ll enjoy from our recent credit card terms change. ", "Now Kathy will describe some of the key merchandise initiatives that we are pursuing this fall.  ", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Thanks, Doug. As you just head from Greg and Doug, we are not immune to the economic environment. Our expect more, pay less brand promise has guided us through economic booms and recessions throughout the years. Its flexibility allows us to evolve with our guests\u2019 changing preferences and with the volatility of our environment. While our long-term strategy remains the same, we are making changes to our merchandising and marketing tactics to ensure we remain relevant to our guests. ", "In the current climate, we are increasing our emphasis on pay less. We remain keenly focused on ensuring our prices are the same as Walmart\u2019s on all identical and similar products in local markets. Furthermore, we remain committed to offering differentiated product that truly delivers value for our guests in terms of design, quality, and price point. ", "With exceptional value and prices across the store, combined with our ability to provide guests with the benefit of one-stop shopping for both their wants and needs, we realize our greatest opportunity is in communicating our value and convenience messages to our guests. ", "To do this, every circular now features several spreads that showcase fewer products with bigger images, bold price points, and strong value headlines. We are reevaluating how we leverage our end caps. In addition to featuring products that are on sale, we are ensuring our signing clearly communicates value and that we have a healthy number of end caps with low price points across the store. ", "And within every merchandise category, we\u2019re ensuring guests have choices with the right balance of good, better, and best assortments. This means we carry a variety of SKUs within a range of price points, all of which deliver exceptional value based on the design and quality of the items, whether it\u2019s the lowest or the highest price point in the category. ", "Driving guest traffic to our stores is critical, especially in this economy when guests are conserving gas. Our frequency driving businesses remain an integral component of our strategy and we are continuing to expand our offerings. ", "We have significantly increased our SKU count of Target brand commodities that offer guests national brand equivalent quality with lower price points. By establishing Target as our guests\u2019 one-stop shop for their health and wellness wants and needs, we are driving trips with Target pharmacy, [Clear RX], and our expanded $4 generic drug program. And our grocery business continues to grow with new offerings of our differentiating owned brand, Archer Farms, and value-owned brand, market pantry, at our Super Target and general merchandise stores. ", "By increasing communication to our guests about our value and convenience, we will ensure they turn to Target for their needs and wants. After they are in our stores, delivering new, innovative assortments entices guests to buy, driving sales and margin. ", "Great design is part of our DNA and we pride ourselves on developing partnerships with renowned designers to bring differentiated assortments to our guests at great prices.  Across our store, we are constantly updating our assortments with newness so guests are consistently surprised and delighted with affordable and accessible design. ", "For example, our Go International apparel collections are constantly updated with new designers who have build credibility in the industry and whose high-end lines are aspirational for most of our guests. We are currently showcasing the talents of Richard Chi, the visionary designer who helped launch the Marc by Marc Jacobs brand. At the end of the month, we will introduce our next Go International private label collection that delivers fast fashion. And in October, we will launch Jonathan Saunders, whose high-end collections are carried at Harrods and Harvey Nickel\u2019s in London and Neiman Marcus in the U.S. ", "Newness in apparel extends to our boys and young men\u2019s assortment as well. In late July, we rolled our Sean White for Target. The clothes are designed by Sean, renowned snowboard and skateboard champion, and his brother, Jesse White, and are reflective of Sean\u2019s attitude and lifestyle, building credibility and resonating with our young male guests. ", "In accessories, our limited time only designer strategy continues to drive a sense of urgency and guest shopping patterns, with high-end designer names available for a fraction of their upstairs price. ", "In handbags, we are currently featuring Monica [Boutiere], who is a favorite among celebrity fashion icons. In jewelry, we are offering Dean Harris, whose designs have been used in the fashion shows of Mark Jacobs and John Barbados. ", "In October, we\u2019ll introduce handbags by Anya Hindmarch, who has boutiques around the world. Also in October, we\u2019ll introduce shoes by Sigerson Morrison whose high-end designs sell at Barney\u2019s and Neiman Marcus. ", "Our exclusive design partnerships continue to differentiate our home assortments, from Thomas O\u2019Brien to Simply Shabby Chic by Rachel Ashwell. We are adding a new layer of excitement in stationary and tabletop next month with the elegant and whimsical work of decoupage artist John Darion, whose assortments are sold in upscale boutiques worldwide. His collection at Target will exude affordable design. ", "We have significantly evolved our beauty offerings to ensure we are our guests\u2019 destination in this important category. Our guests will buy relatively higher price points in beauty despite the economy, as evidenced by our continued success with salon hair care and high-end skincare assortments. ", "Next week, we will launch three new designer partnerships in cosmetics -- [Jim McKidd], a brand created by the fashion model and London makeup school owner; Pixie, a boutique cosmetic line with stores in London; and Napoleon Curtis, a brand by the Australian makeup artist who recently opened stores and a makeup school in the U.S. ", "This fall, guests will be able to find assortments by 22 renowned designers, which is the most we have ever featured in store at one time. To celebrate, we are presenting the Bulls-eye Bodegas, four limited time spaces in New York City in Manhattan -- I\u2019m sorry, in midtown, in Union Square, Soho, and the East Village, September 11th through the 14th. Reinforcing our commitment to great design and low prices across beauty, home, fashion, and accessories, these limited time stores will feature our designer assortments with an average price of $25. ", "While value is prominent in our guests\u2019 minds, they continue to celebrate events and holidays, which is why having the right product at the right price is critical to ensuring Target is our guests\u2019 seasonal destination. ", "Because Halloween lands on a Friday, we will leverage its timing to position Target as guests\u2019 entertaining and party solution headquarters with dinnerware, festive food solutions, and theme d\u00e9cor. All of our offerings, from must-have candy and trick-or-treat essentials, to differentiating costumes and d\u00e9cor will deliver compelling prices that meet our guests\u2019 wants and needs. ", "We understand that guests sometimes equate clean, well-designed stores and fast and friendly service with higher prices but we believe guests can have a superior shopping experience and save money. We are confident in the power of our expect more, pay less brand promise and our increased focus on helping guests understand our value message. Through disciplined execution of our core merchandising strategy, we will drive sales and profitable market share growth. ", "Now Greg will provide some final comments. Greg. ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "While the current climate poses challenges to our near-term pace of growth, our strategy is solid. We are keenly focused on superior execution and our team remains committed to delivering the constant flow of innovative and well-designed merchandise at an exceptional value that our guests expect from Target. ", "As a result, we believe that Target is well-positioned to grow profitably in this economic and competitive environment and we feel confident that Target will continue to deliver substantial value for our shareholders over time. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "I have two questions; one for Doug and one for Greg. Doug, in terms of the provision that we saw on credit, obviously up a lot, about $40 million more than we thought because the write-offs were up, would you call this provisioning level a new normal, given what you are seeing in the portfolio? Or was there a bit of a catch-up given the spike that we saw in write-offs in the quarter?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, it may well be the new normal in the near-term but I certainly don\u2019t expect it to be the new normal in the long-term. And rather than calling it catch-up, I think it\u2019s more forward-looking in nature. Clearly our write-off rate in the quarter, our write-offs in dollars or in rate were higher than we expected going into the quarter and as we analyze our risks as of quarter end, as we always do, we think those risks are heightened looking into the future. ", "So the additional reserves that we booked this quarter were designed for the express purpose of accommodating through the current quarter\u2019s P&L and on the quarter end balance sheet for a heightened degree of losses in the near-term. How long it will last is a judgment call but that\u2019s what drove our entries. ", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and that 7 to 8 of write-offs that you had talked about previously, do you think now it\u2019s more like 8 to 9 or do you want to give us a new range?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, I clearly missed the mark on our previous forward-looking statements but I think that the range that you are suggesting, 8 to 9 for the year, is now more likely, far more likely than 7 to 8. ", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And then Greg, well done on the margin side, execute on SG&A. I guess given the outlook there\u2019s obviously still a lot of pressure. What can we do to improve traffic trends, even if we stay in this current macro environment for more than just a couple of quarters? What can you specifically do?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, I think Kathy highlighted some of the things that we are doing and have done and will continue to do, and that is really centered around content innovation, strength in our marketing messages to convey that we are convenient, one-stop shop where you don\u2019t have to visit a number of different stores. You can get all of your wants and needs at Target. It\u2019s our end cap assortment. It\u2019s our brand standards, in-stocks, friendly service. It\u2019s a combination of all of those elements that we are going to continue to deliver on that we believe in time will help us achieve our long-term objectives. ", "In the short-term, it\u2019s going to remain challenging and I just don\u2019t really expect to see the traffic trends change until we see a stronger economic climate in the U.S., and so we\u2019re planning our business cautiously. We are working very aggressively to drive footsteps into the store. We\u2019re taking market share across the store but we want to do so profitably so that we can continue to deliver strong EBIT margin. ", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citi. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Good morning. I also wanted to reiterate a very impressive performance on the SG&A side. Doug, can you go through for us some of the buckets in terms of what\u2019s driving that improvement?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, timing issues certainly have an effect on this quarter, as they do on any other quarter. I mentioned at the conference call 90 days ago that I thought that our expense controls in Q1 were better than flowed through because of some timing issues. Here I\u2019d make the mirror image comment -- I think that our expense controls remain very strong but there\u2019s more flow through in the current quarter than I think the underlying performance merits. ", "Year-to-date, we\u2019re about 20 basis points favorable in SG&A as a percent of sales and I think that is a fair representation of how effective our expense controls have been in the current environment. Clearly wages and benefits remain squarely in our focus, not just at the stores but throughout our enterprise. And at the store level, store hourly labor as a percentage of sales improved yet again this quarter, as it has in the past several quarters. In addition, we have various pay for performance incentive plans throughout our enterprise, including and especially including executive management. And that provided year-over-year expense benefit in the current quarter as well. We\u2019re cycling a very strong quarter last year with weaker performance this year. That\u2019s the way those plans are designed to produce benefits. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "And then also with regard to inventories this quarter, obviously just a snapshot but how should we think about inventory growth versus total sales growth?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well inventories clearly grew faster than total sales. There\u2019s a variety of individual contributors to that fact, some of which has to do with last year\u2019s base, a lot of which has to do with the snapshot in time at the end of this quarter. On balance, I would say that regardless of that mathematical relationship, inventories remain in excellent condition and I will stand by my forward -- fearlessly stand by my forward-looking statement that sales mix, not fashion risk, will be a much larger determinant of our gross margin rate Q3, Q4. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Okay, and then one question for Greg -- Greg, you talked about the segmentation strategy across the stores and assortment and that you continue to expect results [of the initiative] to deliver. Can you talk about where you are with regard to the initiative and what we should expect to see in the future as well?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we are relatively early in this initiative and it is across the entire store where we are really segmenting our business and looking at low volume, medium, high volume stores and trying to segment the presentation and have volume strategies to ensure that we are getting the right inventory in the right store at the right time. ", "For example in apparel, we are just initiating this initiative in our women\u2019s area as we speak and throughout the balance of the fall, and particularly first quarter next year, we will be expanding it to some of the apparel areas. ", "And so in the past, we have been focused both on a combination of store volume and presentation guidelines and going forward, we are more focused on the store volume and less on the presentation, and we have some fixturing changes that we have introduced and we are going to do some things to make the shopping experience even better while we are able to thin down our inventory, our inventories in the stores that don\u2019t need it and redirect that into stores that need it and in some cases, just eliminate it from the network altogether. So we\u2019re focused on apparel and as we transition through our hard lines categories, we are introducing low volume planograms in those businesses as well. So you will see this progress really over the next 12 months. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks so much and best of luck. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uta Werner with Sanford Bernstein.", "Uta Werner - Sanford C. Bernstein", "I have a couple of questions related to the new store goals that you spoke about. I wonder if for the \u201909 numbers of 70 to 75 net new stores, you can give us an idea of how that might split across quarters, across formats, maybe geographies. ", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "There\u2019s nothing remarkable about the change or the absolute numbers. There is a good deal of volatility in any year in terms of the quarters in which we open stores. As most of you know, we open stores in three discrete batches, March, July, and October, so there are typically no other months of the year in which we open stores but there\u2019s a lot of ebb and flow between those three cycles in any year and I would hesitate to make a fearless prediction. ", "Separately, mix of formats, mix of geography, nothing particularly remarkable -- obviously in some of our most sales challenged environments, that\u2019s where there\u2019s the most pressure on individual proposed store pro formas. But big picture, big scheme of things, nothing particularly remarkable, net simply a reduction in the range of about 20 stores from our earlier thinking. ", "Uta Werner - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Any thoughts on what might 2010 look like?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Too early to tell. I would tell you that again, I wouldn\u2019t characterize this as a goal. This is simply our freshest projection based on looking at individual transactions one store at a time and adding them up in a granular kind of way. At this point, we are obviously not as far along at that level of detail for 2010 or 2011. I would hope and potentially expect that that number could grow somewhat. I would stop well short of believe that this is simply a one-year dip. ", "A reminder here -- a substantial portion of our capital spending in any given year is related to future period store openings, so essentially we\u2019ve come within a couple of stores of the forward-looking statement that we made regarding \u201908 openings, yet our CapEx in \u201908 is well below our earlier expectations because we will spend less in \u201908 than we planned on \u201909 and 2010 openers. ", "Uta Werner - Sanford C. Bernstein", "That leads to my last question -- when I looked at TP&E on the balance sheet, the construction in progress number is significantly lower than last year at this time and of course in part, that will be driven by the number of stores you opened. But I was also wondering if you are seeing any kind of construction cost benefit coming your way. ", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I wish that were the case. It is not. Actually, the main driver year over year of construction in progress line item change on our balance sheet is a fairly small change in timing that we executed between then and now in terms of moving property out of construction in progress and into the property account. So in essence, this year\u2019s July cycle is already in the property accounts. Last year\u2019s July cycle at this time was in construction in progress, so the total property and equipment is unaffected by this small timing change but that line item is offset by increases in other line items. ", "Uta Werner - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Thank you, Doug. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Ohmes with Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - Merrill Lynch", "Just two quick questions -- the first question I have is just can you give us a little more detail on the categories where you are seeing the strongest gross margin improvement? So for example, you called out apparel and home having less markdowns. Are the margins, are the gross margins actually tracking up in that category? That was my first question. ", "The second question was on the inflation outlook that you mentioned -- any changes to where you are seeing the most pressures in inflation? If you could just give an update on that. Thanks. ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "With regard to the gross margin rate performance, we had solid improvement in gross margin rate throughout the store for the most part. It wasn\u2019t really remarkable but it was up single digits, low-double-digit improvements in apparel, in our hard lines category. We saw a little pressure in food but it was nicely distributed throughout the area and that was fundamentally because we managed our business very well, our markdowns were well-controlled, our initial markup was healthy. So in total, we saw some nice increases in rate to the tune of about 15 to 20 basis points. ", "On the inflation front, as you know last year at the end of October, we said that in aggregate, it was more of a deflationary, a slight deflationary environment and it\u2019s really only at that single point in time that we can tell you with any specificity what the prior year was. But all indications are that that slightly deflationary environment will shift to a flat or slightly inflationary environment based on all of the cost increases that we have seen. The number of cost increases and the breadth to which those cost increases have been applied in both discretionary and non-discretionary categories. ", "Robert Ohmes - Merrill Lynch", "Terrific. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "I just have two quick questions as well -- one is on the new food DC that you just opened and the one to follow. Could you give us any sense for what sort of an impact that could have, or how you think about the impact that that has on the operating contribution from the food departments? Does that give a certain basis point benefit to you as a result of bringing that in directly? Or is it a number of different things that it ultimately impacts to drive margins higher?", "And then the second question is on store payroll for Doug -- that being one of the buckets that you have some flexibility with in terms of reductions when sales drop, how do you see the technology investments you\u2019ve made the last few years benefiting your ability to run on lower payroll levels versus just bringing them down with the lower volumes today?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Let me address the food DC. I mean, as you know, the essential mechanics of it are these are net present value positive for us, so they are good economic projects but they require us to spend significant capital in terms of the investment required to build those facilities and maintain and operate those facilities. Clearly we are taking on an expense challenge because we are now operating those facilities. In exchange for that, we expect and have seen higher gross margins on the merchandise side. So we will see a slight improvement in our gross margin rate. We will see a slight deterioration in our expense rate but the combination of those factors are a very solid economic proposition for us. ", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Your question regarding technology investment, it\u2019s clearly inextricably intertwined with our ability to control payroll as a percent of sales, so our ability to continue enjoying in-stock levels as high as they are and to continue providing guest service as high as it is, our ability to accomplish all of that while reducing the number of hours per hundred or per thousand dollars of sales is directly related to our investment in systems that allow us to be more efficient in our in-store processes. ", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Doug, I guess stated another way, as we come out of this cycle and sales eventually do recover to some level, some positive level, do you see the potential to carry a lower overall store expense or payroll expense rate than you would have the prior three to four years during a positive cycle?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Yes, absolutely. ", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Charles Grom with J.P. Morgan. ", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "Doug, mix has been a drag, as you called out, call it 60, 70 basis points the last four quarters. Given recent sales trends over the past 60, 90 days, would you expect that to alleviate a bit as you enter the third and the fourth quarter, or should we expect similar compression here?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "That is a great question and I genuinely wish I knew the answer because what we are about to do is to begin cycling the periods last year where our year-over-year mix issues were most profound. August was a great month last year. September and October were not great months from a mix standpoint, so it will be a fascinating discussion point 90 days from now to look at the actual facts and see if the happy case comes through with some muted mix impact year over year, as we begin cycling those periods from last year, or alternatively whether we will be in for a continuation of the current year-over-year trends. We do not have a precise or crisp crystal ball on that one. ", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then a second question would be for you, Doug, again -- pace of buy-backs, roughly 30, 33 million shares per quarter. Given the lower CapEx, would we expect to see a similar rate in the back half or should we expect that rate to come in a little bit?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "No, our guidance regarding execution of our share repurchase program has not wavered one item of punctuation or one word since we first launched this program. We said that our $10 billion authorization would likely be completed over a three-year period and that we would expect to complete half or more in 2008 based on a combination of liquidity, share price, and operating results. We are already 47% of the way through the $10 billion, so obviously the current pace of that program is not at all likely to continue Q3, Q4 because we clearly continue to expect to take no deliberate actions that would threaten or jeopardize our credit rating. This was a very carefully engineered program at the time. ", "Now, all else being equal, lower CapEx equals higher share repurchase. That\u2019s great new from a share repurchase standpoint. The bad news is, all else being equal, lower operating results equals lower share repurchase. Those two issues, which are not unrelated, tend to cancel and allow us to continue to believe that the pace we have described for share repurchase remains as fundamentally intact today as it did nine months ago when we first announced the program. ", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Doug, when you shared with us your second half outlook, you were looking for a better Q4 than Q3. Does that pertain to sales as well? [You had seen the opportunity] to comp positively in the fourth quarter, given those easy year-ago comparisons --- does that still hold true today?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Yes, that was actually one of the three items that I cited in believing that we are more likely to meet or exceed current Q4 median First Call EPS expectations, so I think we will be more challenged in meeting or exceeding Q3 than Q4 expectations and sales -- the likelihood of better same-store sales is one of the three key factors. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then share with us perhaps Q3 sales expectations?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, August is a great leading indicator. We said at the beginning of the month we expected minus three to minus one in same-store sales, and I remarked earlier that we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of volatility. If the first 10 days were all we had to look at, clearly we would be very concerned about our ability to meet even minus 3. Sales are on a better pace since then, which alleviates some of that concern. But clearly we are in for a more challenging period. ", "September and October, at this moment, are a little more wide open as a result of this volatility. I\u2019ll make a fearless forecast but this clearly is one that we\u2019ll stay on top of and communicate as the quarter unfolds. I think we should we be somewhere in the range of flat for the quarter by the time the dust settles. That forecast is more at risk of being wrong than sales forecasts we would typically make 60 days out. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great and then just on the lowered store openings, does that give you some dry powder to perhaps be opportunistic in the event that blocks of stores become available as other resellers are obviously under more strain and we\u2019re seeing some consolidation come through?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "All else being equal, it certainly does but I\u2019d be quick to add two important facts; one, with each passing year, as we penetrate more and more U.S. trade areas and the real estate of others in those trade areas is no longer of any interest to us whatsoever. And secondly, given the process that I outlined in detail earlier, we would go through a rigorous site-specific sales forecast that is likely going to be lower today than it would have been had we looked at that real estate one, two, three years ago. ", "So I think that your comment is quite sound at the margin and in concept but I am not particularly optimistic that we are likely to acquire big blocks of the real estate of other troubled retailers in this environment. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Great and then my last question for Greg, as you had mentioned, you are shifting the marketing handle more to the pay less emphasis here and the under $10 handle and the dollar week circulars that we are seeing. Can you just talk about what if any -- what you are seeing change in terms of the complexion of the customer and how that is impacting -- we\u2019re obviously still seeing trips down but talk about the success of that shift in marketing. Thanks. ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways, our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge in that our stores are fun and unique and we have both what you need and what you want and during these tough economic times, some of our consumers don\u2019t want to be tempted as much as they have in the past. So we\u2019re still trying to define and find the right balance between expect more, pay less. The current environment means that the focus is squarely on the pay less side a bit but as you heard from Kathy, we have record amount of innovation, content innovation. We want to still convey our brand positioning, that we are unique, we have great value, we have high quality, terrific merchandise and that you can come to Target and save a lot of money, even in the discretionary category. So even though it\u2019s not topical for them to spend money in home and apparel right now, our values [inaudible] exceptional owner, design relationships and what we are delivering in terms of content innovation are just terrific. ", "So we believe it\u2019s important that we continue to deliver great merchandise and talk about that as well, and over the long-term this has been the right combination and it will be the right combination. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "Good morning. I appreciate Kathy\u2019s comment that clean and fast, friendly stores contribute to the perception of higher prices. I wonder if you would include in that the record amount of innovation and design content that you have. Have you done market research with your consumers to find out whether they think the prices across the store are higher as they see more designer introductions? And then how do you communicate the value versus I guess higher price point department stores? And then generally, what would we see as the comp growth for those unique designer categories, relative to more basic product in those discretionary categories?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Let me see if I can take these one at a time. I don\u2019t believe -- we haven\u2019t done research specifically as it relates to is the content in our store driving a mal-aligned price perception. It is more reflective of our brand standards. It\u2019s great lighting, clean aisles, no clutter. And has less to do with really the content because even though we are offering designer merchandise and fast fashion, the price points of these offerings are clearly well understood by our guests and they come in and they recognize that a handbag that they are going to be paying $100 for in specialty retail, they can buy it at $29.99 at Target or it\u2019s an outfit that\u2019s a third of the price. So we believe and our research validates the fact that they get the fact that the innovation of merchandise and what we are delivering from a content standpoint is not overpriced and does not degrade from our pricing image. ", "So it is really about the incredible brand standards that we have worked hard and it\u2019s the speed of the check-out, it\u2019s the friendly service and it\u2019s the number of team members we have on the floor at any given point in time. And that is really where they are kind of connecting the potential or the perception that we are slightly higher priced. ", "So we are going to continue to focus on the value aspects and make sure that we are resonating with our message and trying to find the messages that really, really connect with them during this tough economic time. ", "And then your third question was about what, comp store sales again?", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "If we looked at the categories where you have the most unique content and designer relationships, how would your comps be where you have the unique product versus where you have more basic product that\u2019s not as design driven?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we\u2019ve said all along that the consumables and food and health and wellness categories continue and this is -- continue to outpace the growth of our apparel and home categories. This is not a new phenomenon. This phenomenon has been going on for some time and frankly the results in our designer, fast fashion, go international categories have been exceptionally strong. It\u2019s really not the fashion side and the newness and innovation that is underperforming. It is just the core basic day-in and day-out I think I\u2019ll pick up a couple of extra items while I\u2019m at Target kind of mentality that we are not able to capitalize on in this market. But it is about the -- we are in a fashion cycle and people want to be inspired and be optimistic about the merchandise they find at Target and we are focused on that and that\u2019s doing quite well. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "And then I have just one final question for Doug -- how much was the expense line benefiting from incentive compensation across the company year-on-year? And then should we take your comments to mean that based on the run-rate you have year-to-date in expense control, that that\u2019s an approximation of where the company wants to be moving through the rest of the year? Thanks. ", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Incentive compensation was between 10 and 15 basis points favorable in the quarter in SG&A rate. It\u2019s about the same amount by which it\u2019s likely to be unfavorable in Q3 because Q3 last year, as you\u2019ll recall, was the quarter in which performance was well below expectations after two very strong quarters that preceded it. ", "Year-to-date, we\u2019re 20 basis points favorable in SG&A as a percent of sales. The biggest wildcard in predicting what that will look like in the fall season is to predict sales. I feel very confident that our expenses will be very well-controlled in dollars but as a percent of sales year over year, that equation has a great deal to do with how strong or not our sales growth is likely to be. Give or take, I think we are likely to lie within 10 or 20 basis points of neutrality in expenses for the back half of the year, depending on what happens to sales and some other expense specific items. Could be 20 basis points unfavorable, it could be 20 basis points favorable but I think that\u2019s the range of responsible expectation. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company. ", "Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company", "Just a question on the reserve rate -- if we look at that as a percentage of receivables, it was about 3% or so in the quarter, perhaps on an annualized basis, 12%. And I\u2019m recognizing that it\u2019s forward-looking, anticipating future write-offs -- how should we think about that as a percentage of average receivables for the remainder of the year? Should it stay up at around that 3% pace per quarter?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "That is certainly possible. It would not be the center of my expectations. Here\u2019s the way I would think about that. Clearly write-off rates are elevated at the moment compared to where we have been and certainly compared to our earlier expectations. I think it\u2019s highly likely that write-off rates will remain elevated for at minimum a quarter or two. The real judgment call is trying to figure out at what point in time will write-off rates turn the corner due to the combination of significant changes in underwriting that we\u2019ve executed in all aspects of our underwriting and the significant reduction in open-to-buy that we\u2019ve executed across subsets of our file as well. ", "We have seen across the last two quarters some stability in our balance weighted portfolio FICO scores, and that is a great leading indicator of what might occur, what we would expect to occur Q1, Q209 in terms of write-off rates. ", "So is it possible that our provisioning, our expense in one or both of the next two quarters could be as high as it was in the second quarter? Yes -- whether it remains that high really remains on the -- really hinges on the judgment call we\u2019ll need to make about how long these aggravated levels of write-off might occur. ", "I do want to focus for a moment though on the income generating side of the card portfolio and not just the expense and loss side of the portfolio. The terms change that we recently executed, all else being equal, beginning in Q4 this year will add 200 basis points or more to our spread to LIBOR, to our overall portfolio yield on the managed portfolio and therefore net net, write-off rates would have to increase yet another meaningful amount and stay there to neutralize the benefit of that terms change. I expect to begin generating handsome profitability in our card portfolio beginning no later than Q4 of this year as a result of all of those dynamics pulled together. ", "Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company", "Okay, and then just as a follow-up to that, given the tightening that you have had, both on existing lines and new accounts, what should we expect receivables growth to look like for [inaudible] -- do you think that tightening impacts, comp store sales in the back half?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "First of all in terms of portfolio growth, you will see a steady decline in the year-over-year growth rates as we move forward quarter by quarter, whether you are focused on average receivables or period end receivables, those figures were in the upper most 20s -- in other words, 28%, 29% in Q1 -- 25%, 26%, 27% now. It will fall into the low 20s in Q3 and still likely be in double-digits but no longer in the 20s by Q4. So the year-over-year growth rates will dissipate. ", "They won\u2019t dissipate quite as fast as we once might have expected because in this current environment, not only is the activity per dollar of balance carried much lower in terms of charges, both inside our stores and elsewhere, but it\u2019s also the case that payments are much lower per dollar of balances carried and therefore these accounts aren\u2019t amortizing as fast as one might have earlier expected. ", "In terms of your second question, the effect on our same-store sales of all of this activity in our card portfolio, I think -- I could answer that question literally but I think you\u2019d be better served by, if you\u2019d allow me to refocus your question at a broader level. We\u2019re executing these activities at the same time that our partner, Chase and others in this industry, Citi, Banc of America and so forth, are also executing very similar activities. And that is creating a fascinating dynamic at point of sale because for the first time in modern history in the quarter just ended, the penetration of all forms of credit cards, ours and everyone else\u2019s at point of sale fell. Debit has been growing, of course, for years. Debit passed credit in terms of form or payment in our stores several years ago but only recently Q1 did the penetration of aggregate credit, our cards and everyone else\u2019s essentially moved from positive territory to neutral territory. And in the quarter just ended, it\u2019s a negative territory. ", "Clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards is not just our own but more broadly across the universe is one of the issues that is determining our same-store sales performance in the current environment. ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We have time for one more call. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Lehman Brothers. ", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe just address if you are seeing any significant consumer trends on the good, better, best and mix in various categories throughout the business, and maybe just a bigger focus on private label consumption?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "You know, we are seeing some changes in good, better, best but it really varies by category. So for example, in food we\u2019re seeing a bit of a trade-down on things like, you know, from steak to chicken or premium chocolate to basic candy. We are seeing national brand equivalent products. They are own brands performing exceptionally well, gaining significant penetration there. ", "You know, but on the other side of this, Bob, I would tell you that in some of our discretionary categories, in home, you know, we\u2019re seeing for example some trade-down in domestics where they are being perhaps a little bit more selective in what they are buying, a comforter versus a duvet or perhaps pieces of the bed, not the full bed. But at the same time, some of our best products are performing incredibly well, so Field Crest we relaunched in March continues to perform exceptionally well and apparel, as Greg mentioned, Converse One Star is our best brand and it\u2019s performing well, as well as C9 by Champion. So kind of a mixed bag. ", "", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you very much. Good luck. ", "Gregg W.

(Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Gregg Steinhafel, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Good morning and welcome to our 2008 third quarter earnings conference call. ", "This morning I will briefly discuss our strategy and performance in the context of an increasingly challenging economic environment, then Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will share important aspects of our 2008 third quarter financial results and describe our outlook for the remainder of the year. Next, Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising, will discuss key merchandising initiatives for the upcoming holiday season. And finally, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "The increasing financial challenges and economic uncertainty facing American households continue to pressure our performance during the third quarter. Our slower pace of top line growth in our retail segment and subsequently higher write-offs and related reserve activity in our credit card segment resulted in disappointing earnings in the quarter. However, despite our soft sales, we were pleased with the operating profit performance in our retail segment as we continue to take a very disciplined approach to the management of our inventory and expenses.", "While we are not pleased with our overall financial performance and we are keenly focused on improving our near-term results, we remain committed to our fundamental strategy and to managing our business for the intermediate and long term.", "As the environment continues to deteriorate and consumer spending, especially in discretionary categories, continues to contract, we are adjusting tactics to ensure that Target remains a price leader in the market and aggressively pursue market share gain opportunities. Our dedicated team is working hard to deliver compelling reasons for our guests to shop at Target in these difficult times. We are keenly focused on offering exceptional value, presenting a bold assortment of holiday gifts, most-wanted items and well-designed basic and fashion merchandise, and ensuring that our guests receive a superior experience in every store every day.", "We recognize that it is essential for us to effectively communicate our unique value proposition more than ever before. Target's ability to deliver newness, great design, and quality is only half of the story. Our great prices on everyday basics and fashion items are the critical other half, and we are working to ensure consumers understand that the two are not mutually exclusive. Their synergy is what makes us Target and unlike any other retailer.", "To deliver profitable performance in this environment, we have carefully reviewed and edited our merchandise assortments to ensure that our content is relevant for our guests, reinforced our focus on in-stock reliability and superior guest service, thoughtfully controlled the growth of our expenses, repositioned our in-store signing and holiday marketing campaign to clearly convey our commitment to value, reasserted our commitment to being a low price leader in the market, and strategically invested our capital, including suspension of substantially all of our share repurchase to retain our strong investment grade credit rating.", "With a strong emphasis on delivering exceptional value, we believe that Target, Wal-Mart and Costco will be the big winners this holiday season. In addition, we recognize that some of our other retail competitors may not emerge intact from the current economic turmoil. While we do not celebrate the misfortune of others in our industry, we believe that a smaller competitive set would be to our benefit when the economy improves. In addition, we remain confident in our strategy and financial strength and we believe that our dedicated team, disciplined execution, unique blend of differentiation and value, and our strategic deployment of capital effectively positions us for long-term profitable growth.", "Now Doug will describe our third quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2008. ", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Thanks, Gregg. As a remainder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via webcast. Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a Q&A session and John Hulbert and I will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow up questions you may have.", "Also, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings.", "In my comments this morning I plan to cover three topics: First, I'll review key aspects of our third quarter performance in our retail and credit card segments. Next, I'll discuss the proactive steps we're taking to ensure thoughtful deployment of our capital in this environment, including reductions in our pace of capital investment and our decision to temporarily suspend substantially all of our share repurchase activity. And finally, I'll share an updated outlook for our business through the remainder of the year.", "In our second quarter conference call I stated that the primary challenge to our near-term earnings performance was the pace of sales in our Retail segment and that our second largest challenge was the write-off rate on our receivables portfolio. Not only does that statement remain true today, our results in the third quarter also reflect the fact that both of these metrics were more challenging than we expected as we entered the quarter.", "In our retail segment, our comparable store sales fell 3.3% in the quarter. This decline, combined with the contribution from new stores, led to total sales growth of only 1.7%. This performance is meaningfully slower than the already soft sales performance we had experienced through the first two quarters of the year and below the expectation that we laid out 90 days ago.", "Against the backdrop of this weaker sales performance, our Retail segment EBIT margin rate was stronger than expected, driven by strong gross margin rate performance. Specifically, our third quarter gross margin rate improved 52 basis points over last year. This result was driven by rate improvements within categories which were only partially offset by the mix impact of faster sales in our lower margin consumable and commodity categories. In isolation, this mix impact was between 40 and 50 basis points in the quarter. ", "As is typically the case, category gross margin rate improvement was driven partly by the array of long-term initiatives that Kathy and her team have in place to drive margin performance and was in part the result of a variety of timing issues that lead to variability and, in this case, favorability in our quarterly results. For example, in the quarter we enjoyed a 10 basis point favorable gross margin impact related to workers\u2019 compensation expense in our supply chain.", "Our Retail SG&A expense rate was even with last year's rate. While flat performance in this metric is not as strong as we experienced in the first six months of the year, it continues to reflect very disciplined control of the growth in expenses, only 1.7% higher than a year ago, against the backdrop of unexpectedly soft sales performance. ", "We continue to see strong productivity improvements in our stores, which are being partially offset by challenges in other store expenses, such as utilities. Measured against last year, we had a number of generally offsetting timing issues recorded in SG&A in the quarter. Examples are as varied as losses from hurricane damage and the P&L benefits of performance-based incentive compensation reversals.", "Just as the pace of our sales continues to be the number one challenge in our Retail segment, write-offs and the related need to build appropriate reserves continue as the number one challenge in our Credit Card segment. Consistent with other issuers of credit cards, we saw continued deterioration in delinquency and write-off performance during the quarter. This led to higher-than-expected bad debt expense, both due to write-offs within the period as well as in addition to our reserve of over $100 million in the quarter to accommodate anticipated write-offs in future periods.", "As expected, our year-over-year receivables growth continues to moderate from prior quarters as we annualize the impact of last year's product change, with average gross receivables growing just under 20% and period end gross receivables growing less than 15% in the quarter. On a sequential basis, our quarter end gross receivables were only 1.4% higher than our position 90\u00a0days ago. In part, this is the result of very tight risk management controls and represents the net impact of both lower new charge activity and lower payments. ", "We continue to tighten all aspects of portfolio underwriting, granting fewer new accounts with lower average credit lines, aggressively reducing open credit lines on many existing accounts, and pursuing more proactive collections. We know that these tightening activities will have a meaningful impact on future portfolio risk metrics and write-off rates, but this impact will take place over time, with write-off rates likely continuing to increase modestly across the next few quarters.", "Next, let's turn our attention to our deployment of capital resources, focusing on both our reinvestment of capital within our business and the execution of our share repurchase program. We believe it makes sense to continue to more carefully scrutinize each decision we make, whether related to new stores or to any other capital we invest in our business in light of macroeconomic conditions. ", "Additionally, as we have previously discussed, the pace of execution of our share repurchase program continues to be governed by the same factors we have previously outlined, specifically our liquidity, our share price, and our business results. In concept, this means that we intend to continue to pursue thoughtful ways to reduce and refine our future capital investment program. It also means that we've decided it's prudent to curtail substantially all of our share repurchase activity for now. Importantly, these actions are likely to reduce our applications of cash even more than the potential reductions in cash generated by our two business segments.", "This remains a fluid equation but, to give you some sense of magnitude, I think our outlook for capital investment in 2009 is now more likely to be closer to $3 billion plus or minus than to our previous estimate of nearly $4 billion. A substantial portion of this change is our reduced estimate of investment in 2009 in support of stores that would have opened in 2010 and beyond. In addition, we continue to carefully review and will likely reduce the number of new stores we expect to open in our October cycle next year.", "Now let's turn to our expectations for the holiday season and the remainder of the year. As we stated previously, we continue to plan our business very conservatively in light of the unprecedented economic challenges in the current environment. Recent comparable stores sales performance has been volatile. For the third quarter it was in the minus 3% range, October about minus 5%, and our outlook for November was a range from minus 6% to minus 9%. Combine these results with our meaningfully different third and fourth quarter performance in 2007, add to that a different holiday calendar this year, and it becomes clear that it's difficult to create a credible single point estimate.", "What is clear is that our fourth quarter sales performance, consistent with any of these trends above, would put pressure on our gross margin and expense rates, leading to a moderate decline in our operating margin rates from the fourth quarter of 2007.", "In the Credit Card segment we expect the typical seasonal build in receivables during the fourth quarter and we expect year-over-year growth to continue to moderate, ending the year with receivables about 10% higher than the end of 2007. We expect our quarterly write-off rate to increase modestly from our most recent experience, perhaps into the annualized range of 10% to 11%. This would result in a write-off rate for the full year slightly above 9%, consistent with the outlook we shared with you last month.", "In contrast to write-off expectations, our key overall measure of portfolio performance - spread to LIBOR - and our key measure at the segment level - pre-tax ROIC - should stabilize around or slightly above their third quarter levels. This expectation reflects the anticipated beneficial impact of our recent terms changes.", "Pulling these two segment discussions together, the largest variable remains the question of same-store sales. For example, if we were to experience a negative mid single-digit decline in comparable stores sales in the fourth quarter that would likely produce fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. While we're working in earnest to drive stronger performance, it doesn't seem prudent to reflect strong assumptions in an outlook at this time. Obviously, given the volatility of recent trends, it's possible that sales and operating performance could lead to results that would fall short of these figures.", "Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to provide a brief update on our analysis related to the real estate actions advocated by Pershing Square. Together with our outside advisers, we continue to review the assumptions underling Pershing Square's ideas. This analysis is still in process, and no decision has been made. And we'll share our conclusions once the analysis is complete. In this spirit, we're focused in this call today on our results and outlook. There'll be plenty of time to discuss our views on real estate in the near future.", "Now Kathy will share some of the key merchandise initiatives for the holiday season. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "", "Thanks, Doug. As we head into our most important season of the year, our sales performance in the current economic climate continues to be our number one challenge. We know that many of our guests are facing significant economic difficulties and are curtailing their spending, especially on more discretionary items. As always, our goal is to respond to what our guests tell us they want and need and to maintain our relevance in this tough environment.", "To meet this challenge, we remain keenly focused on providing differentiated assortments that offer quality design at great prices, exceptionally low prices on national brands, and an even better value on our own brands. Our everyday and ad prices are extremely competitive with WalMart and other specialty retailers who lead their categories. We have gained market share in every quarter this year and we are confident we will gain market share again in the fourth quarter.", "This holiday season we're focused on giving our guests compelling reasons to visit our stores and presenting exceptional value with both price points on end caps and market leading value offerings in our circular. ", "In toys, electronics and entertainment - three categories which account for roughly onethird of our total holiday sales - we are focused on having the right mix of must-have items and differentiated assortments at exceptional values. We will have great gift-giving items such as Blu-ray DVD players and movies, digital photo frames, and an array of Apple products, including the iPod Touch, Nano, and Shuffle. Our social and active gaming offerings, like Rock Band 2, Guitar Hero 4, and Wii Fit, also make great gifts. We are maximizing this rapidly growing trend that is being driven by women and kids, a core guest segment of ours.", "And in toys we have all the must-have items, like Elmo Live, [inaudible] and a wide assortment of Legos, including the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones collections. We carry toys at aggressively low price points that fit every budget, whether a guest needs stocking stuffers or gifts for friends and family. ", "Our grocery offerings drive traffic to our store and allows us to be our guests' one-stop shop for holiday entertaining and gift giving, whether it's the distinctive [inaudible] flavors of our Archer Farms brand, the value and reliability of our Market Pantry assortment, or the innovative offering within our Choxie brand chocolates, our own brand foods deliver exceptional freshness and quality at surprisingly affordable prices.", "Gift cards are an important part of our holiday offering, and this year we will feature new holiday gift cards, including a holiday juke box that plays three songs, a digital camera gift card, and a gift card filled with M&Ms, which we will promote as fun and convenient gift options for guests. ", "And at Target.com, our new Deal of the Day offering features six value items every day at incredible prices for only 24 hours, while quantities last. Most items cannot be found in our stores and the promotional pricing can only be found at Target.com.", "While we are confident that guests will be attracted to our merchandise content and value proposition during the holiday season, we are carefully managing our merchandise inventories to simultaneously drive sales, reduce markdown risk, and maintain reliable in-stocks for our guests. We will achieve these priorities by ensuring frequency category items - like food and commodities\u00a0 are always in stock and by [inaudible] more conservatively for fashion and seasonal merchandise.", "To ensure reliable in-stocks and drive profitability, we are continuing to expand our merchandise segmentation strategy. This strategy customizes the assortments in each category, the timing, space and how it's merchandised in each store based on volume, demographics and local preferences. The flexibility of our expect more, pay less strategic positioning will continue to drive our competitive advantage over time. By bringing constant newness into our stores, leading the market on prices, and managing our inventory with discipline, we will continue to gain market share in this economic environment and drive sales and profit during the holiday season.", "Now Gregg will provide some final comments. Gregg?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "The challenges facing the U.S. and global economies are unprecedented and the impact on American consumers is clearly evident. As I said at the outset, Target is aggressively pursuing market share gains and thoughtfully managing our business to emerge even stronger when the economy improves. We believe that Target remains well positioned to grow profitability and deliver substantial value for our shareholders over time. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robert Ohmes - Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - Merrill Lynch", "", "A couple of quick questions - the first was, I was hoping we could get maybe a little bit more of an update on the expanded food test and how that's going for you all. And then maybe partially related to that, if you could talk a little bit about food inflation and the role that that's been playing in your same-store sales more recently and if there is an outlook for food inflation in our same-store sales heading into next year? ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Regarding our expanded food test, food continues to be a focus and a priority of ours, both in our Super Target and our general merchandise formats, and we will continue to test and evolve expanding that footprint as time goes. The small test I think you're referring to has just recently set in some Minneapolis stores and it's too early to conclude anything at this point in time. ", "Regarding food inflation, we continue to see volatility in food price and commodity prices, and it's been up and down and we still expect some food inflation for the foreseeable future, although clearly the growth in inflation has moderated somewhat compared to earlier times this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Neil Currie - UBS.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "", "I just wondered if you can go into a little bit more detail on the gross margin improvement, particularly with regards to the mix enhancements? I wasn't quite able to hear the answer fully, but I wanted - given the fact that one would imagine that you're seeing greater strength in consumables - where you got those mix enhancements?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I'll address the numbers side of that, and I'll look to Kathy to provide a little color.", "What I had said in my prepared remarks is that against the backdrop of a 52 basis point improvement in gross margin rate for the quarter, there was a negative impact in isolation due to sales mix in the range of 40 to 50 basis points. So turning that around the other way, we enjoyed net-net a benefit of 90 to 100 basis points from factors other than mix. Some of them are category specific and some of them are timing issues. I cited as an example of the timing issue a 10 basis point improvement in gross margin rates in the quarter due to workers\u2019 compensation expenses improvements year-over-year in our supply chain. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Neil, as you know, we've been working on gross margin for a long period of time, and we're continuing on many key strategies. I think probably the biggest has been our disciplined approach to inventory control this year, making sure that we are in-stock, supporting our guests but yet minimizing the amount of markdowns that we're taking.", "We've continued to expand our segmentation strategy, which is really about customizing assortments in each of our categories across all of our stores, so we do this in many ways. Some of it is timing related, whether it's weather or holidays. Some is assortment related, you know, high volume or low volume indexing items or brands. We've done a lot of skew reduction this year. In addition, we're growing national brands, which are a higher gross margin. So a number of different initiatives that have driven our gross margin expansion.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "Are you doing more [inaudible] pricing so you're managing to raise some prices in some markets while being keener in others and manage the overall pricing level a little higher?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "We are raising retails where the market will bear it, but we remain absolutely committed to being priced with Wal-Mart on all identical items in local markets.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "And you said that - or Doug said - in the fourth quarter that the gross margin performance may not be repeated, so what would be the major differences between the third and fourth quarter in the ability to, you know, get that underlying improvement in gross?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "The major difference is our concerns about the pace of same-store sales. While we've been very tight in our supply chain, we certainly didn't anticipate the kind of sales slowdown that we've experienced, where we're coming out of the third quarter at a sharply lower pace of sales than we entered the third quarter, sharply lower than the year-to-date actuals. So net-net, that means that we have some concern about clearance markdown exposure given what might happen here in fourth quarter sales.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "And then finally, you mentioned, obviously, food is a priority. In terms of the cutting CapEx for next year, will that impact your remodeling activity and trying to get more food ranges into the stores?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "It really won't. The primary reduction in capital will be in non-remodel expenditures, like new store reductions, reductions in our supply chain. But we're going to continue to push and test aggressively a multitude of food expansions and remodels in other test stores to make sure that we thoroughly understand where it works, where it doesn't work.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "The lion's share of this most recent change in our view on '09 CapEx is the effect in '09 of capital investment in support of new stores to open in 2010 and beyond. So we're clearly in a mode right now of adjusting our thinking about new store openers 2010, 2011, 2012, and that has a beneficial impact on 2009 CapEx. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan.", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "", "When you look at 2009, assuming unemployment continues to move above where it is today, I was just wondering what you anticipate your write-off picture to look like? And Doug, for the fourth quarter you suggested a modest increase. Could you quantify a potential range for us that you guys are thinking?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Yes. I had said in my remarks that the definition of modest would be an expectation that annualized write-off rates would increase into the range of perhaps 10% to 11% in Q4. ", "As I mentioned last month, we expect that our write-off rate will peak plus or minus Q2 '09 and then being to tail off. And importantly, we have accommodated through the P&L and on the balance sheet appropriate reserves to anticipate that modest increase in write-offs for the next couple of quarters. ", "So famous last words: I would expect that our GAAP reported financials for our Credit Card segment in 2009 would show a substantial improvement from 2008, in which we've experienced not only the direct impact of substantially higher write-offs but also through the P&L and onto the balance sheet the impact of accommodating expectations of heightened write-off levels in the future as well.", "Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan", "A couple weeks back you guys outlined a negative 6 - 9 comp for November, and I realize a lot of that's the shift from a year ago as well as the shift this year. Are you guys still comfortable with that rate and I guess if we're to do a down mid single-digit comp for the fourth quarter, what would that imply for your December expectations?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, negative 6 to negative 9, you have correctly observed, accommodated all of our outlook as of the beginning of the month for calendar shifts and so forth. As you know, we don't typically provide mid-month updates on sales these days, but I will observe that our sales in the front end of the month have started out much lower than we might have expected. Whether that's a good leading indicator or whether it's a function of the calendar is difficult to know at this point.", "Clearly, if we ended up at mid singles for the quarter, the answer to your other question is we would end up with a negative same store sales performance in the month of December.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ", "", "Briefly, you talked about food inflation earlier, but could you expand that and talk about some of the other inflationary pressures within HBA and apparel as some of the demand has clearly slowed down domestically for some of these products. And have you seen any sort of relief in that aspect?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "You know, so far this year we've seen mid to upper single-digit increases in food, CPG and home. And starting this fall season we've seen increases in the low single-digit range in apparel. I think it's a little too early to determine where this is going to be headed, but obviously we've seen some differences in commodity prices lately and fuel, which will affect transportation. So at this point I would say it is more stable than it's been in the past. We are seeing some decreases, but yet to be determined where that will head.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ", "And then just in terms of the online business, have the trends in the online business, the sales there, have they been similar to what you've been seeing in the stores? Clearly credit has become a little bit tighter. I'm just wondering if the trends are any different online.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, in the past our online business was growing very, very rapidly and was in the double-digit growth range consistently for many years. They have and we have experienced the same kinds of softness in the number of transactions and sessions as we have in the Retail business. So it's still positive, but it is growing at a much slower rate than it was growing last year first quarter and middle of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "", "The question I have is when you look at the run rate and the expectations heading into this fourth quarter, would it be possible to quantify the run rate of the discretionary sales trends versus nondiscretionary sales trends and how they've actually changed from Q3 into October and really what you've seen so far?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, I think of that in total, not in same-store terms, because that's what is captured in our mix commentary. And generally speaking, if we look at food and health and beauty as one set of numbers and home and apparel as another set, the gap between those two is about the same now as it was earlier in the year. All of those figures are growing at a slower pace.", "To put some dimensions around that, we just reported a quarter in which total sales grew a little under 2%; food and health and beauty combined were up a range 10%, clearly gaining market share in those categories, and for the quarter, apparel and home products, down low singles, low to mid singles. Clearly, as bad as that sounds, that is a pace that is considerably better than the U.S. market as we see estimates for the U.S. market, and so we continue gain share in those categories as well. ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "And then just a question on the credit business. When you look at the relationship between past due rate and late fess, how should we expect that to trend into the fourth quarter and into 2009?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I would expect that past dues, as you call it, will continue to increase moderately. I don't expect a substantial deterioration in those figures. And similarly, I think the trend in recording late fee income, flat to improved slightly. Improved is a very strange word in that context; I'd just as soon never collect a dollar of that kind of income, but I think we'll see flat to up somewhat.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, LLC", "", "In the context of the sharply lower comps that we've been seeing, can you describe the movement of merchandise across the good, better and best price points? Where are we seeing the greatest slowing?", "And then given the current customer off tick that you're seeing, where, at the margin, do you expect making the greatest changes? In other words, are we going to see a little more product at the opening price point given the circumstances?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "You know, we have seen some trade down, but it is still very mixed. So we've seen things\u00a0 I think we talked about this last quarter, you know, people trading steak for chicken, not buying all pieces of the bed but buying parts of it, maybe the comforter versus the duvet and all the accessories that go with it. We're also seeing strength in our own brands, which is probably a trade from some national brands.", "However, at the same time I'll tell you that the best brands are still performing very, very well. So things like C9 by Champion, our Converse One Star, Smith & Hawken, [Bowes], you know, I could go on and on, many high end brands still performing very well. So the key for us is really the balance within our assortments between good, better and best so that we're fitting all budgets at this time. ", "So I don't think that you're going to see a huge change in our assortment. We are making sure that our end caps are focused on great values, single price points, more so in the past, so you'll see a slight change there.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, I would just add that our strategy is essentially expect more, pay less. We are not going to dumb down our assortments in this economy. We have to continue to stay focused on innovation and fresh, new, exciting merchandise. And our value proposition is such that the majority of what we sell in our store is very, very affordable. So we're going to maintain our commitment to new product introduction, emerging designers, and having what our guests want overall. And in some cases, we're going to be strengthening our commitment to the best price points, but in all reality most of these new introductions are going to be under $20, and that's very affordable for our guest segment.", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, LLC", "My other question, Doug, regarding the reduced CapEx and the implications for square footage growth, should we think of this as being an approximately proportional impact on footage growth in 2010, and is there a point where we start to anticipate more bang for the buck? At what point do you think we start to see some favorability there in terms of development costs? Just an approximate range; I know it's early for potential square footage growth 2010 through 2012 - are we down in the 2% to 4% range or any comment you might have on that would be helpful, too.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Certainly. First of all, because of the lead times involved in developing the kinds of projects that we pursue, the reductions will be bigger in 2010 than in 2009. We have a lot of high quality stores in the pipeline already for 2009 and most of those are well under way right now in terms of construction and we're not about to stop construction on great new stores that are in that current stage.", "Alternatively or in contrast, this would be the time that we would be developing a lot of new stores for potential opening in our March and July 2010 opening cycles, and we clearly are taking a much, much, more cautious approach to underwriting those stores at the current time. So I think that 2010, particularly in those first two opening cycles at this point, will be a much, much thinner new store program.", "I think the rest of the timing, the answer to the October cycles in 2010 and all of the answer for 2011 and 2012 hangs in the balance of seeing just how sharp this recession turns out to be and just how long it lasts. In the happy case that we came out of this current period of unpleasantness rather rapidly, then we could be back in more typical kids of new store opening cycles as early as late 2010. In contrast, if this period lasts considerably longer, then 2010 in total would be quite thin and we're in complete control at this point 2011 and 2012. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, LLC", "The other part of the question is just on what you anticipate for development costs. Do you foresee a point where we get more footage per CapEx dollar or is it just too early to say yet?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I don't think that's likely to happen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nathan Rich - Citigroup.", "Nathan Rich - Citigroup", "", "My first question was in the past you had utilized disruptions in the competitive environment and other retailers closing their doors to be opportunistic about square footage growth. In light of the CapEx cut that you guys just announced, how should we think about how you're thinking about the competitive landscape going forward?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Oh, let me be crystal clear. If a block of stores came along at a price that allowed us to enjoy robust returns, we would pursue that block of stores regardless of any guidance we've given today. The guidance that we've given today is the guidance that's appropriate, thinking about our new store program one store at a time in the classic sense. But clearly, we have maintained ample access to liquidity and have maintained open to buy, if you will, to be able to pursue those, if in fact they develop in a way that met our strict underwriting criteria, obviously not in unlimited size. ", "But you're hearing from us what is our best guess about CapEx moving forward. We don't start with strict aggregate top down targets and then fill out a program. We underwrite our new stores one store at a time, and we're trying to tell you what we think that will add up to become. If the facts change and opportunities develop that we don't see today, of course we'd consider pursuing them in light of our then-current business results, liquidity and underwriting model.", "Nathan Rich - Citigroup", "And then my next question is you guys have obviously done a very good job controlling expenses in this environment. Can you talk about some of the further opportunities that you see to reduce expenses in 2009?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "I would say that we're going to continue on the path that we've been on and that is centered around enterprise-wide initiatives, so we will continue to look for ways to increase productivity in our stores without compromising the guest experience. And that will center around really labor and scheduling and supply chain and improving productivity where we've made technology investments in the past, particularly around mobile technology. We will look at all aspects of our headquarters and other work centers to find ways to reduce travel and other kinds of expenses. ", "So all areas of Target are very, very focused on that and we are being very careful, thoughtful but very aggressive and we believe that we can continue to make some progress on expense reduction efforts, but a lot will depend upon what the sales environment is next year to determine whether we're able to leverage that to our advantage or whether the sales environment is so challenging that even with strong expense management we will be deleveraging.", "So that will be determined as we move through the fourth quarter and into first quarter of next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "", "I have two questions, one on payables and then on traffic. First, Doug, on the payables, they were down 3% year-over-year. Could you try and split that into any changes in terms versus your buying for the fourth quarter?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "No, it really isn't a change in terms, but rather a slowing down the pace of goods flowing into our supply chain and paying on our normal terms has produced the result you see - inventory up very little versus the same point last year and given the calculus, given the rate of change in the flow of goods into our supply chain, the payables result just comes out of normal application of payment terms.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And then on traffic, if you look at the second quarter, comps were negative 0.4. If I remember correctly, traffic was a slight negative and ticked a slight positive. Is it fair to say that the comp we just did, the negative 3 - 3, that all the shift in that was traffic and, if so, anything you can do to address it?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, I would say that those same trends exist today and the majority of our sales shortfall is very much due to the traffic trends. And the transaction amount is slightly higher than last year due to a slightly better mix, but slightly fewer items per basket. We have been very focused on all aspects of our frequency strategy and we've been working very hard at trying to draw consumers into our stores in a very, very challenging environment. ", "And I think Kathy outlined many of the initiatives that we've been focused on in order to do that, but right now the consumer is more than hesitant. They're very stressed right now and we, like other retailers, are all struggling from the inability to get to motivate and inspire people to come into our stores.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein.", "Uta Werner - Sanford Bernstein", "", "I wonder if you could give us an update on the geographic performance in Retail as well as the Credit Card? I remember four states stuck out last time. I wonder if you can update us on what's happening there now.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Yes, you're certainly referring to the fact, as we've observed before, that our sales shortfall and our credit card risks have been more heavily concentrated in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and parts of California than in the rest of the country. That remains true today, although I'd probably add a few to that list, certainly Georgia and the Carolinas, Tennessee, are much less healthy than they once were, and Michigan, Ohio is another area that is very unhealthy from both a sales standpoint and a credit card risk metric standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "", "Doug, given the changes in credit card terms and the outlook for consumer spending, how likely is it that we could see year-over-year growth in credit card receivables turn negative next year?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "That is certainly plausible. It would not be a baseline forecast that I would generate as of today, but clearly plausible.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC", "And then over to the mix impact, which was 40 to 50 basis points, that was on top of the first real big drop you saw a year ago. I know there'd been some underlying mix for a long time with you guys. Is it safe to say that you're thinking maybe 40 to 50 on an ongoing basis now until the macroeconomic changes or is there anything that you're doing specifically that could help change that over the next few quarters?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, Kathy and her team work diligently every quarter to produce results that offset the adverse mix impact, but there's no doubt that this kind of adverse mix impact will be with us until the economy improves. It is simply the result through our picture of sharply lower apparel and home sales in this country in stark contrast to the growth that we're experiencing in food and health and beauty categories, in line with macro trends in U.S. retailing.", "I'll add one more comment to help put some of that into perspective. If you add together food and health and beauty, in our case in the aggregate those categories, as large as they are, remain smaller than the aggregate of apparel and home products. That's why the algebra works against us in the current environment in reporting sales.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "Doug, on the buyback it seems, you know, halting the buyback seems prudent in the current environment. Perhaps share with us what you would need to see to reinstate the program.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Our pace of execution in our share repurchase program remains squarely focused on the same three variables it always has - our liquidity, our share price, and our business results. And we keep a keen eye on our credit ratings. We have said before that we would intend to take no intentional actions that would threaten or jeopardize, in particular, our short-term credit ratings.", "It's our judgment that if we continued to execute our share repurchase plan at the pace that we once envisioned that that would constitute doing something that's within our control that might well have an adverse impact on those short-term credit ratings, and so it seems only intelligent for us to pause and be very careful until we see some improvement in our underlying business results to be able to once again fire up the share repurchase program.", "I continue to fully expect that we will complete that program within the next several years, but clearly our original timetable that we outlined in the fall of '07 when we launched the program is no longer the correct outlook.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "And then just some questions on the gross margin commentary, the approximate 90\u00a0basis point improvement you saw ex the mix impact. Could you perhaps more specifically quantify how much was related to the timing benefits? You had alluded to about 10 basis points. If you can share with us how much was timing versus how much was category improvement.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Yes. It gets to be a bit gray in the middle; the world isn't quite as crisp as timing versus category specific activities. But as a rule of thumb I would tell you that of that 90 to 100 basis points, perhaps a third is timing and two-thirds is due to the direct activities of Kathy and her team.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "And then just following up on the gross margin, am I correct - it sounds as if in the past we had talked about gross margin pressure had been predominantly mix related, but now it seems as if some more markdown vulnerability. How does this make you think about placing inventory plans going forward?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, the markdown vulnerability is clearly the result of the differential between our fresh, current, near-term outlook and the outlook that we had for Q4 when we made these inventory commitments. Clearly, we are taking a much more conservative view of the front half of 2009 as we make commitments to be able to continue to preserve our margin rate equation to the extent that it's possible to preserve it. The number one challenge remains retail sales. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just lastly, a question for Gregg. You had alluded in your opening remarks about being very sharp on pricing. If you could perhaps talk about the competitive environment, where you want to be priced versus Wal-Mart, what you're seeing, how aggressive it is out there.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we expect this holiday to be equally if not more aggressive than prior holiday seasons. I think there is and will be perhaps a slightly heightened sense of desperation by some of the other retailers. So our approach typically has been and will continue to be that we will meet WalMart on all like and identical items in local markets. That commitment has not changed, and so, as you know, there's ups and downs and some volatility and that marketplace is somewhat fluid, but we remain very, very committed to ensuring that our prices are rock solid day in and day out.", "From a promotional standpoint, we have taken a very aggressive point of view this year in terms of our promotional pricing, so we expect to be price leaders on selected items in our circular. This is not unlike what we've done in the past, but given the current environment and recognizing how challenging it is, we will be even sharper than we have in prior years. So we expect, as Kathy said, to gain market share throughout this fourth quarter and we are investing more of our markdowns into promotional pricing and we look to offset that in other ways, by reducing either the number of items or other ways within our P&L so that that markdown investment is really net neutral.", "So we expect it to be aggressive. We're going to be right with the best of them on a promotional standpoint and we're going to be with Wal-Mart on an everyday basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "", "First on the expectation that the write-offs will peak in Q2 next year, I was just curious - are you assuming that unemployment gets modestly worse from here or stays about the same? That's the first question.", "The second question is on credit. Recognizing you have to protect the profitability of the Credit Card business, I would imagine that all this tightening will have some sort of impact on your ability to generate comp store sales. Just curious if you've put any math behind that.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "First of all, the comment about the likelihood of our write-off rate peaking somewhere around Q2, I don't mean to imply with such precision that I - fundamentally, Q2 plus or minus a quarter, is the right way to interpret that forward-looking statement - the major assumption behind it is the product change dynamics from 2007. Certainly, we've talked about geography, but the impact is especially profound in those geographies in the accounts that were product changed in 2007 and from a timing standpoint it is pretty clear that most of that or the bulk of that problem will be behind us by Q2 '09.", "Certainly if unemployment were to rise hundreds and hundreds of basis points, then, of course, despite this seasoning of those accounts, then the unemployment change would become a dominant feature and that would defer the point in time that we turn the corner in write-off rate.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "And then with regard to the tightening of credit and the potential impact on sales?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, as I mentioned in this very call 90 days ago, tightening of credit across all U.S. credit card issuers has already had a very important adverse effect on our sales and I'm sure it will continue to do so. This will not be a new phenomenon looking forward. After years and years of fairly steady growth in penetration of our overall sales, the percentage of our sales charged on anyone's card - one that we issue together with all other cards, from VISA, MasterCard, Discover and Amex - fell for the first time in many, many years in Q2 this year, and I expect that trend to continue for awhile.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "And then one last question - recognizing that every quarter is different, we're in fourth quarter about to lap, I guess, some more aggressive cost management activities on your part and at the same time we're seeing comps go a bit more negative. Is there any sort of broad guidelines you can give us on how much you deleverage on SG&A per negative point of comp?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I think that every quarter is different and I wouldn't begin to predict today what some of the unique timing issues might be to our fourth quarter this year. But in light of the ifthen statement that I made in my prepared remarks - if negative mid single-digit comps, then likely $0.90 to $1.00\u00a0 at that kind of level I would expect some modest deterioration in gross margin rate due to clearance markdowns and likewise I would expect some modest deleveraging - think 10, 20, 30\u00a0basis points, not 50 to 100 - in SG&A rate as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory.", "Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory", "", "I also wanted to follow up a bit on credit, two questions. One is, you know, given what seems to be a greater usage of credit these days, is that in fact the case? I mean, I know your credit revenues are up but is it because more people are paying late fees or is it really that people are using the credit more?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "No, credit revenue is up because the portfolio is up. As you know, we have a variable rate card portfolio, so revenue is not up nearly to the same extent as receivables because our APRs are lower today than they were a year ago.", "Actually, if you look to the schedules of our press release you'll see that credit usage, both inside our stores and outside our stores, is down in total and down quite significantly when correlated with the receivables base. ", "Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory", "And then the other part of the question, then, is also on the way you guys have been provisioning for the write-offs. It seems like the provision is keeping a pretty wide margin above where the write-off rate is lately, and I guess I'm wondering, is that because you're still playing a little bit of catch up or is it because you're anticipating things to get precipitously worse in the next couple of months?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I don't think we're playing catch up at all, but let's take the current quarter as an example. Clearly, our risk metrics deteriorated during the quarter. We've already seen all of the major banks report their credit card results for their calendar third quarter; their risk metrics deteriorated as well. They, like we, added meaningfully to reserves in the quarter in order to properly account in the current period for the risks of the period end portfolio. ", "So, quite specifically to your question, yes, we have anticipated that write-off rates will continue to deteriorate modestly and we have correctly and, in our view, appropriately, booked the amount of additional expenses - booked the bill to the reserve, if you will - to an appropriate level for our quarter end position. In our case that added $104 million during the quarter to expense over and above what our write-off amounts were during the quarter.", "And at this point we probably have time for one more question to stay within our time slot.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "", "My question's on the sourcing side. Over the past year there's been a lot of pressure on sourcing costs, and now it appears that raw material costs are coming down significantly and a lot of excess factory capacity, that seems to be increasing quite a bit, and I'm wondering if you can talk about how you are taking advantage, if at all, of the changing sourcing environment and when you might realize some beneficial impact? ", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, I would tell you that there are a lot of ups and downs in that sourcing equation. For every raw material piece good that is going down and energy costs going down, there are other factors that come into play, whether it's currency or whether it's labor rates and things like that.", "We look at this category by category. We maintain a balanced sourcing network throughout the globe. And we will continue to pursue the opportunities country by country, and we're pushing very hard to make sure that our manufacturing base is supporting us but still profitable. ", "So it's an equation that's very, very fluid, and we saw a lot of pressure on cost increases this year. As Kathy said, they're starting to moderate and go the other way right now. Now how fast and how far they will go is anybody's guess, but at least it's stabilized and it costs are going in the proper direction right now.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Well, net-net of all the variables, can you quantify a little bit the order of magnitude.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "It's really too difficult to quantify that, because it really is business by business. And while we have some going up, some are stable, some going down, and it changes on a month to month basis. So it really is difficult to give you a precise estimate in terms of what's happening from a pricing standpoint.", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "As important as these issues are, they are very small relative to the question of sales. The pace of sales in our Retail business remains our dominant variable. Our margin rates have been quite resilient in spite of all kinds of challenges this year.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Okay, that concludes Target's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2008 earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded February 24, 2009. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Steinhafel, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Good morning and welcome to our 2008 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. This morning I will briefly review our performance and discuss the actions we are taking to improve sales, capture market share and increase profitability in this challenging economic environment. Then Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will discuss our financial results and outlook for 2009. Next, Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President Merchandising will describe initiatives we are pursuing in support of both the Expect More and Pay Less side of our strategy. And finally we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As the economy contracted at its fastest pace in decades during the final months of 2008, Target experienced challenges in both our retail and credit card segments that resulted in a decline in our fourth quarter financial performance. In our retail segment our results were characterized by a fundamental change in consumer spending patterns that negatively impacted both our traffic and sales, particularly in higher margin discretionary categories like seasonal, apparel and home; an elevated level of markdowns resulting from weaker than expected sales and intense promotional activity across the retail industry; and exceptional expense control, particularly in our store hourly payroll.", "By carefully managing our inventory levels and taking appropriate pricing action to remain competitive, we continued to capture market share during the holiday period and we were able to exit the year in a very clean inventory position. ", "In our credit card segment our performance, like that of other credit card issuers, was adversely affected by the deteriorating risk environment. As a result, we incurred higher than expected bad debt expense as we wrote off accounts and added significantly to our reserve in anticipation of additional write-offs of receivables in 2009. ", "While we cannot control the broader economic conditions that have affected our recent performance, we can remain firmly focused on managing our business to deliver strong performance in the near term while staying true to our strategy in the long term. We seek to make Target the preferred shopping destination for all our guests by delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation, and an exceptional guest experience by consistently fulfilling our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise. ", "As a result, we are taking thoughtful yet aggressive actions, balancing offense and defense to insure that we remain relevant to our guests; drive sales; and improve profitability; and sustain our competitive advantage. ", "These actions include an enhanced focus on frequency driving strategies which are centered on food, pharmacy and commodities; a consolidation of our own brand portfolio to make a more powerful statement about these exclusive, high quality, affordable assortments; greater emphasis on communicating our value message including both the exceptional prices and the outstanding quality throughout our assortments; and an intense devotion to operational discipline, including an enterprise wide commitment to expense control and careful inventory management, particularly in the seasonal and high risk categories.", "We will continue to pursue thoughtful ways to increase efficiency and productivity throughout the organization, but we are firm in our commitment not to take actions that will damage our brand in pursuit of a short run decrease in expense. ", "To mitigate risk and improve our financial performance on the credit side of our business, we have taken action on several fronts. We are firmly focused on driving revenue to offset higher costs in the current environment, and we are refining all aspects of our risk management strategies to address an environment in which consumers are more likely to encounter financial stress. ", "Our relationship with J.P. Morgan-Chase continues to be beneficial, with both companies working to define our products and services in a way that exceeds cardholders\u2019 expectations but also preserves profitability. We believe this partnership will strengthen throughout 2009, resulting in improved profit in our credit card operations.", "During 2008, Target opened 114 total new stores or 91 stores net of relocations and rebuilds. In support of this store growth, we created over 16,000 new jobs across our organization with the majority in our stores and distribution centers. ", "As we continue to focus on efficient capital deployment and maintaining strong liquidity, we have reduced our store opening plans in 2009. Our three store opening cycles in 2009 envision the addition of approximately 75 total stores or about 60 net new locations with 27 stores in our upcoming March cycle, including our first two stores in Hawaii. On average each of these new stores is expected to create well over 150 new jobs in the communities where they open. ", "We continue to invest in technology to maintain our competitive advantage including the development of new pharmacy, finance and compliance systems in support of our growing scope and scale. ", "In addition, reflecting our growing commitment to food, we are making significant investments in support of our perishable food distribution capabilities. We also continue to invest in our food offerings in recognition of its importance in driving greater frequency, increasing guest loyalty and making Target a preferred shopping destination. In recent years we have expanded our selection and assortment to provide improved convenience and outstanding value, and in 2009 we plan to further enhance our assortment of dry, dairy and frozen and add perishable items in new and remodeled general merchandise stores.", "As we work to address the challenges currently facing our business, we remain firmly committed to the values and strategies that have driven our success for nearly 50 years. We are passionately committed to providing a workplace that is preferred by our team members. We recognize that the strength of our brand and our strategy over time lies in the talent and dedication of our team. ", "We are also keenly focused on remaining relevant to our guests by anticipating their needs and wants. In a macroeconomic environment that is characterized by a more frugal consumer mindset, we believe Target is well positioned to capture profitable market share growth. While we expect continued volatility in the coming year, we are more determined than ever to strike the right balance of Expect More, Pay Less for our guests. ", "We continue to give 5% of our income to support and enrich the communities we serve. And we are proud of our long history of strong corporate governance and remain disciplined stewards of this corporation\u2019s assets, diligently focused on generating superior shareholder value over time.", "Now, Doug will describe our fourth quarter and 2008 results and share more detail on our 2009 outlook, including our capital investment plans.", "", "Douglas A. Scovanner ", "", "Thanks Gregg. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via webcast. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll conduct a Q&A session and John Hulbert and I will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "This morning I\u2019ll first focus my comments on the fourth quarter and full year 2008 results in our retail and credit card segments. Then I\u2019ll discuss some current trends and themes surrounding our generation of cash flow and how we intend to apply it in 2009. And in conclusion I\u2019ll provide some clarity on our outlook into 2009 and beyond.", "Let\u2019s begin with a view of our retail segment performance. On the sales line we recorded just under $63 billion this year, in total up 2.3% from 2007, although on a same store basis we were down 2.9%. As you know our fourth quarter sales performance was much weaker than our full year performance despite an easier base of prior year sales comparisons. Specifically, our fourth quarter total and same store sales metrics were three to four percentage points weaker than our full year performance as the effect of sharp macroeconomic deterioration played through our sales equation, especially on our more discretionary apparel, home and seasonal categories.", "We successfully promoted our way to an ending point of very clean inventories, but at the short term cost of some additional gross margin rate pressure. Ultimately, we delivered about $5.9 billion of EBITDA and $4.1 billion of EBIT in our retail segment for the year. These figures were of course below our beginning year expectations, driven in part by sharply lower sales especially across many of our more discretionary categories. ", "Importantly though our EBIT benefited from a very thoughtful and comprehensive effort on expense control. In fact, our expenses in the fourth quarter were actually below last year\u2019s levels in dollars, all the more remarkable in light of our operating 91 additional stores this year and the costs we recently disclosed related to team member reductions. Expense control continues to be a key strength of ours in this harsh environment. ", "In our credit card segment we experienced sharp increases during the fourth quarter on a wide variety of leading indicators of future risk. While our write-offs in dollars were in line with our expectations, these risks compelled us to add meaningfully to our reserves for future credit losses on existing receivables. In the quarter we accomplished this by expensing $245 million more than we wrote off. We ended the year with a reserve just over $1 billion representing 11.1% of year-end gross receivables. This reserve was $440 million more than our reserve just 12 months ago. Notably the magnitude of our accrual for future write-offs created an operating loss for the fourth quarter, an outcome experienced by nearly all large U.S. owners of similar card portfolios.", "For the year, our overall portfolio delivered profits representing a 1.4 percentage point positive spread to one month libor. And that\u2019s after expensing 14.4% of average receivables for currents and projected write-offs on our existing receivable. One way to think about this 14.4% expense figure is that it is equal to the sum of the 9.3% of average receivables written off during the year and the 5.1% of average receivables we added to our reserve by accruing expense this year for expected trouble to follow.", "Looking beyond the results of our two segments, we\u2019ve been very deliberate in the management and application of our cash resources in the current environment. We continue to evaluate and underwrite proposed new store projects one at a time, and over the past several months we have committed to only a small handful of new stores entering our new store pipeline. ", "Lead times in this arena are such that our March and July opening cycles in 2009 will look similar to historic patterns of growth, but we will begin to taper off sharply in the fall of 2009 and well into 2010. While there isn\u2019t a lot of visibility into 2010 at the moment, a rough range of total new store possibilities would be framed by, say, five stores on the low end and perhaps 30 on the top end. ", "In total, our base capital investment plan for 2009 envisions investing just over $2 billion. Alternatively, we might invest as much as say $2.5 billion if we were to see clear and measurable signs of improvement in the economy that led us to return to meaningful numbers of new stores in 2010 and beyond. ", "This leads directly to another of our great strengths in the current environment. The combined impacts of this forecast of capital investment and the curtailment of open market share repurchase means that we are likely to enjoy one of our strongest years ever in generation of free cash flow in 2009. Specifically I expect Target to again generate more than $4 billion in cash from operations in 2009, which would provide ample cash from internal sources to fund our projected capital investments, and pay dividends on our common stock, and fund our $1.3 billion of debt maturing and have cash remaining, all without the need to access the term debt capital markets this year.", "To be clear, we continue to have that access and might even use it to provide additional liquidity insurance or to engage in opportunistic refunding of some of our debt before it is due, but it is not a necessary element of our plan in the near future.", "Now we\u2019ll turn to a similarly specific performance outlook for our two segments. In our retail segment we continue to enjoy positive same store sales and continue to gain market share across most non-discretionary categories in our store. ", "In contrast, while we\u2019re also gaining a meaningful amount of market share in our more discretionary categories, our sales performance in these higher margin areas continues to be much, much softer. Overall this is a recipe in the front half of 2009 for a continuation of mid single digit decline in same store sales. This sales and mix expectation will very likely lead to a generation of EBITDA and EBIT in our retail segment below last year\u2019s profits for at least the next six months, even in light of continued very strong expense performance.", "In our credit card segment we\u2019re actually seeing some encouraging early stage measures of risk, although it\u2019s clearly premature to plant a flag and declare victory. Our write-offs are likely to stabilize in the range of $300 million in each of the next two quarters, levels we anticipated in establishing the year-end reserve I discussed a few minutes ago. We do not currently anticipate the need to add any meaningful reserves in the foreseeable future, especially in light of the high likelihood of modest decreases in our gross receivables. Overall this means that we\u2019re highly likely to return to moderate rates of profitability in this segment in the next two quarters but not likely as strong as the profits we generated in the first two quarters of 2008.", "Net net, this is a recipe for EPS in the next two quarters well below last year\u2019s levels in line with our recent experience. How soon we return to quarterly growth will be determined entirely by the question of when and to what degree we turn the corner in sales and to a lesser extent when and to what extent we begin to enjoy clear and measurable benefits of our risk management efforts in the credit card segment.", "Ultimately we\u2019re positioned not just to survive but to prosper in some very clear ways. Compared to our position exactly five years ago, we have 457 or 37% more stores and 159 million or 17% fewer shares outstanding. In short, ownership of a single share of our stock at that time was associated with about $45 of retail sales in our just ended 2003 fiscal year. And our share price was in the range of $40 per share. Today a share represents a form of ownership associated with about $84 in 2008 fiscal year retail sales and yet today we trade in only the high-$20s. ", "Combined with our expense discipline and unwavering commitment to the brand dynamics that continue to resonate with our guests, these dynamics provide the platform at some point for a sharp increase in measured financial results per share and create the clear potential for even sharper increase in the market\u2019s assessment of the value of a share of TGT. Until then, we will continue to thoughtfully navigate through these troubled waters.", "Now Kathy will share some of the key merchandise initiatives we are pursuing in the new fiscal year. Kathy.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "", "Thanks Doug. As Gregg mentioned the current economic conditions have created a fundamental shift in shopping behavior as consumers seek ways to stretch their dollars and pull back on their purchases of discretionary items. In this environment, Target is keenly focused on delivering a merchandise assortment and experience that meets our guests evolving expectations for price, quality, newness and convenience without compromising core elements of our brand.", "We believe Target\u2019s record of innovation and our balanced Expect More, Pay Less strategy uniquely positions us to continue to capture meaningful market share growth in this climate. To remain relevant to our guests and achieve our financial goals, we are focused our attention on initiatives that increase shopping frequency and help guests better understand the exceptional value and quality of every Target shopping trip.", "For example, in our new and remodeled stores we are allocating more shelf space to non-discretionary categories such as food; household; personal and baby; and healthcare and beauty products. And we\u2019re leveraging our marketing vehicles to drive awareness of this merchandise. In our weekly circular we\u2019re devoting more space to frequency driving categories and using themes to drive trips and basket size. And we\u2019re leveraging receipt marketing and vendor funded program.", "But we know in today\u2019s economy that guests won\u2019t come to us for their everyday necessities if those necessities aren\u2019t priced right. Our competitive shop process which has been a consistent element of our strategy for well over a decade insures that we are priced within one to two percentage points of Wal-Mart on like or identical items within local markets. ", "However, guest perceptions do not reflect this reality. As a result, we are intently focused on improving perception so guests understand that not only are we the right destination for all their needs, but we can meet those needs without compromising quality or the guest experience at prices that meet the competition.", "To boldly and accurately convey our value message we have redesigned our circular to reduce the number of sub-featured items, allowing us to enlarge photos of featured items and present bold, straightforward value headlines. These changes allow us to make a stronger impact with key items and prices. And we\u2019ve increased single price point end caps so that they now represent approximately three-quarters of end caps in our stores. We\u2019re merchandising great value much more aggressively with fewer, bigger items and new signings that present the much stronger value statement.", "We\u2019re also expanding our own brand presence because we know these brands, with their lower prices and national brand quality, deliver exceptional value to our guests. They also provide a great opportunity to strengthen guest loyalty, generate incremental trips, and increase sales and profitability. ", "This spring we\u2019ll re-launch two of our own brands to more clearly communicate their value to our guests. We\u2019ve consolidated more than eight owned brands across multiple divisions to create a stronger presence for Circo, our exclusive brand for kids across all merchandise categories. This consolidation allows us to tell our guests a more complete brand story as they shop throughout the store. ", "In Target Home we\u2019ve taken a similar approach by consolidating multiple sub-brands into a single brand with quality enhancements and redesigned packaging that better calls out product features and benefits. We are editing the assortment and reducing SKU count to allow for cleaner presentation and to more clearly communicate the strength of this brand to our guests.", "And in grocery, Archer Farms, our premium brand and Market Pantry, our value brand, continue to grow reaching a penetration of 20% at year-end 2008, a significant new milestone. We believe that our commitment to developing and marketing these brands will lead to their continued growth in 2009.", "And though we are focused on better communicating the Pay Less side of our brand promise, we are as committed as ever to the Expect More side of that equation. We continue to deliver the newness, differentiated content, and exceptional value that we believe are key to driving growth at Target. ", "Now more than ever we are giving our guests compelling reasons to shop our stores. We will showcase nine designer partnerships in the first half of 2009 compared to eight in the first half of last year and have seen fabulous results from our first designer of the year, Orla Kiely. The Irish born designers\u2019 exclusive home d\u00e9cor collection for Target features practical yet fanciful designs that are full of color, pattern and texture, making the assortment both timeless and uplifting.", "Next, we\u2019re really excited to kick off our first design collaboration with fashion icon, Alexander McQueen and his edgy McQ for Target collection, which launched with pop-up store during Fashion Week in New York.", "We continue to partner with up-and-coming designers as well and will highlight two new eco-friendly lines during Earth Week in April. Loomstate, a line for men and women by returning designer Rogan Gregory and partner [Scott McKinley Hahn] and [Neo], an outdoor living collection. Also in April our limited time only program will feature Felix Rey in handbags and Miss Trish of Capri in shoes.", "And the bold and colorful prints of [Tracy Feis] will launch our next Go International line setting in May. Feis has been on the fashion scene more than 25 years and has developed a brand that is known for its elegance and barefoot luxury that looks as good on the beach as the red carpet. Feis designs are now sold in four independently owned stores on the East and West Coasts and a select few high end specialty boutiques across the country. ", "We are confident that the actions we are taking to drive frequency, strengthen price perception and reinforce our reputation for high quality, well designed content are the right actions to address current business challenges and position Target for long term growth.", "Now Gregg will provide some final comments. Gregg.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Target is intently focused on driving profitable sales and honing our position as a one stop destination for all of our guests\u2019 wants and needs. While we are experiencing challenges not seen before in our business, we believe we are in a unique position to capitalize on the opportunities and leverage our iconic brand, singular vision and talented team to transform Target in ways that will resonate with our guests well into the future.", "We are as committed as we have ever been to sustain our competitive advantage and create substantial shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Gregg you talked about investing in this food offering and I think you specifically said you would further enhance your assortment in dry, dairy, frozen and also adding perishables. Can you help us think about how the stores will look compared to maybe what we saw at the analyst meeting back in October?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Yes, I would \u2013 by the middle of this year all of our or the majority of our single entry stores will have the same look and feel as you observed when you were in the downtown store last fall. So we continue to be very pleased with the sales of that concept; the look, the feel, the assortment. We\u2019re still making some changes but that seems to continue to perform well enough to introduce that as a prototype element in the majority of new stores going forward.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And then with regards to private label I think Kathy said that current penetration as we said was about 20%. I know previously you\u2019d given guidance for about 300 basis points increase per year. At 20% that\u2019s obviously pretty significant penetration. How should we think about that going forward?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "I think you can still plan on an increase in that 200 to 300 basis point range on a per year basis. In a couple of years when we get into the upper 20s percent penetration in all likelihood that will slow down as we start to maybe top out a little bit more.

Steinhafel", "", "Well, I mean, we\u2019ve been testing a lot of different concepts. And one of the key themes that has come through in our guest research is the fact that and what\u2019s resonating with them is the fact that they\u2019re surprised that our prices are as good as they are and as close to the competition as they are. So we\u2019re going to be playing on that aspect and playing on the fact that moms as the head of households are responsible for the family budgets; are more savvy; and come to realize that Target is the place for both their wants and needs. They will have a great experience and they\u2019ll be surprised and delighted by the low prices that they find in our stores.", "Now how we execute that across the various mediums that we have will roll out over the next couple of months, but I think you\u2019ve seen some of our more recent campaigns in broadcast. For example, our New Day campaign plays on that. Our Essentials campaign where we have national brand item at a price plays on that as well. And both of those campaigns have been very, very well received in the marketplace.", "We\u2019re also trying to convey a savvy, smart approach in our circular messaging.

", "And then second the new store productivity levels looked I think low on my calculation for the fourth quarter. Can you sort of comment on if there\u2019s an abnormal variance between, you know, how your new stores are performing versus what the same store sales in your existing store base would imply they should be doing? Thanks.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "I\u2019ll take part of this and Doug will take part of this. The sales impact related to clearance in the fourth quarter and particular December, January is probably in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. It\u2019s a little hard to quantify exactly but I think that\u2019s a pretty fair range. As we enter 2009 our inventories are in exceptionally good position. So unless there is a material change in the economic environment, we really don\u2019t expect to see rate \u2013 gross margin rate deterioration due to markdown performance. ", "We will continue to have the impact of the mix pressures on our business, but we\u2019re in great position from an inventory standpoint. As it relates to the new stores, just like the existing base our new stores are affected by the same macroeconomic factors and are slightly softer than what we had expected them to open at. But there isn\u2019t any meaningful change in how our new stores performed given the environment.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "And I would remind you that there\u2019s a huge amount of volatility in the mix of new stores that we opened, and therefore even when everything is working as well as we would expect it to be, there is substantial volatility in the sales per square foot of these immature stores, quarter-to-quarter.", "Robert Ohmes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "So when you look at the fourth quarter do you think the, you know, the inventory clearance though drove traffic or enhanced your sell through rate significantly so that as you move into a period where you\u2019re not doing that any longer we might see more pressure on your same store sales? Or should we be thinking of it differently?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "The way I would think of it keying off of Gregg\u2019s comment is that all else being equal it drove a half a point or a point of incremental comp store sales in the quarter. And that is half a point to a point of missing sales if you will relative to trends. That\u2019s the reason why among others I think that the right way to read our current business is give or take, down mid single digits in same store sales.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Charles Grom - J.P.

You know we have designers spread now across many different product categories throughout the store at many different price point levels. And so I think there potentially could be some trade down from higher end into Target but I also think that the value equation is very recognizable to our core guests. And it gives them a reason to want to buy and they recognize the value. So I think it really pertains across the affluence.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "", "Do you feel right now that you\u2019re allocation across price points is appropriate for the given cycles, in both apparel and home? Or where are you on that continuum of resetting it for the cycle?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "", "I do think it\u2019s appropriate. It\u2019s something that we are continually evaluating and adjusting.

We\u2019re in the process of really evaluating all of our product categories and editing SKUs. We want to make sure that the value that we do have we clearly communicate to our guests in a well organized way that helps them really weigh, find and grab their attention.", "And so I think we will continue to adjust. You\u2019ll see SKUs go down slightly in the coming year, as you did last year. But I think we\u2019re pretty well positioned.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "In terms of sourcing, your expectations for 2009 in terms of sourcing, inflation, deflation or impact on the gross margins year-over-year?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "", "I think it\u2019s a little early to tell at this point what\u2019s going to happen in \u201909 with pricing. As always we will continue to negotiate vigorously with our suppliers to make sure that we\u2019re getting great prices on all of our products and adjusting our retails accordingly as we go forward to make sure that we\u2019re competitive. But hard to predict at this point.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "I would say that in total we\u2019ve seen some stability and maybe some price softening in certain categories. Clearly the environment that we were in last year where we had inflationary pressures broadly across the store has for the most part abated. And while we haven\u2019t seen significant reductions we\u2019re not really seeing any increases. And in some cases we\u2019re seeing some reductions. So we think that bodes well for the future, but as Kathy said we still haven\u2019t seen enough indication that prices are moving down in a wholesale basis.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "", "Doug, can you give us an update on the \u2013 I guess in October you gave us a couple of sensitivity analyses and the one that is most intriguing now is the 200 basis point increase in the charge-off rate to $0.15 of EPS. And I guess my question is around the thoughts then versus what you just did with the bad debt provision, does that sort of still hold for you guys? And maybe could you give us an update in terms of how you see this playing out in \u201909?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Be happy to. Compared to 90 days ago, our write-offs in the fourth quarter in dollars were in line with our expectations. What happened and you can almost trace this even though our guests don\u2019t live on Wall Street you can almost trace to the weekend, the weekend that Lehman failed and the Merrill Lynch-Bank of America transaction was announced. Sharp increases in risks leading to a clear projected increase in write-offs in the front half of 2009 from our receivables base that existed at year-end.", "And so even though the write-offs weren\u2019t worse in the quarter than we expected, the risks clearly gathered steam and caused us to carefully assess the proper reserve to carry at year-end. Looking forward into 2009 I think our write-offs are likely to stabilize. Q1, Q2 each in the range of about $300 million. One of the reasons that I\u2019m speaking in dollars as opposed to rates is that you\u2019re beginning to see the turn in the portfolio from growth to what will likely evolve into declines in gross receivables. ", "And so I think it\u2019s a crisper language to talk about the dollars of write-offs as opposed to having the variability due to the denominator effect, speaking of rate terms. But nonetheless, not trying to candy coat this, in rate terms that is obviously a meaningful increase from today\u2019s rates. Yet I believe that those rates will clearly stabilize. We\u2019re already seeing signs of stabilization in early stage delinquencies. And that, depending on how that evolves from here, could end up having a beneficial impact in the back half of the year. ", "It\u2019s a bit premature to predict just how much or just what the timing would be. But I feel very good that our year-end reserve should accommodate the levels of anticipated write-offs in the front half of the year and therefore I feel very good about the prospects of returning to modest profitability in this segment in each of the next two quarters and beyond.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "", "And then the other question that I have is when you look at the relationship with Chase on the credit business are you close to a point where, you know, at what level do they get more assertive with control? And you talked about something like that when you initiated this relationship. Are we far from that or is that a concern at this point?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "When we organized that transaction as you know essentially provided the portfolio with sufficiently profitable on a form of cash accounting basis, our partner earns a full caps return and we earn all of the excess to the extent that there is any. Throughout 2008 and specifically throughout the fourth quarter that return has been fully earned by J.P. Morgan-Chase and we have continued to enjoy on a cash accounting basis those excess returns.", "In contrast, on an accrual accounting basis we just reported a segment pretax loss for the quarter, but that is disconnected from a timing standpoint and quite substantially from the accounting with J.P. Morgan-Chase. More broadly on the relationship, we are in a sharing mode where it\u2019s in their best interest and in our best interest, classic mutual alignment, to insure that our risk management techniques, our new account underwriting standards and our existing account line management practices, and especially our existing account delinquent collection practices \u2013 it\u2019s in our mutual best interest to insure that we are as finely tuned in that equation as we could possibly be. And I remain quite delighted with the progress of that relationship.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "My question is related to the deceleration of square footage growth. I mean, the five to 30 that you had alluded to in terms of fall of \u201909 and 2010 clearly your response to the current environment. But help us think about is that perhaps a new run rate? How should we be thinking about store openings going forward?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Well, it wasn\u2019t just an allusion. I specifically said that our range of new store openings in 2010 could be as low as about five stores, could be as high as about 30 stores. Very unlikely to be outside that range by any meaningful amount. ", "I think it all depends on how soon and to what extent we are able to return to a profit formula that makes it a very interesting proposition to invest more aggressively in new store openings. So it\u2019s entirely possible in 2011 that we could open 60, 70, 80 stores. Entirely possible that we could open five stores. It depends on where this economy goes.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "And then just following on that, perhaps update on the CapEx, 2009 CapEx assumptions and what a five store opening in 2010 or a 30 store opening in 2010 would drive \u2013 what sort of CapEx level that would imply.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "To reiterate our base plan is to invest a little over $2 billion in 2009 and in the invent that we hit the high end of the 2010 store opening forecast, our 2009 CapEx could range up to $2.5 billion. But at the moment we are operating at the lower end of that, not the higher end of that range.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "And then just, Doug, you had mentioned first half EBIT lower in first half of \u201909 with declines comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter. I know you\u2019re not giving explicit \u201909 guidance but in the past you\u2019ve commented on your comfort level with consensus. Perhaps you could share that with us today, that it\u2019s the current consensus of 256? Your thoughts on that?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Well, clearly on the front half of 2009 the consensus is higher than the description that we\u2019ve laid out for our business. In the back half of 2009 it\u2019s a little less clear. Obviously we would not expect by the time the fourth quarter rolls around to either repeat the two big drivers on the down side of the performance in the quarter just ended. We certainly do not expect to repeat the markdown experience of Q4 \u201908 and I certainly do not expect to repeat the credit segment loss. So I think looking forward we have a couple of very challenging quarters.", "Last year\u2019s performance, Q1, Q2 relative to what we saw in the back half of the year looks like the good old days. It didn\u2019t feel that way at the time, but cycling against it, it certainly feels that way. Looking into the back half to the extent that we are able to grow earnings in any quarter, certainly Q4 looks like the one to count on.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "", "You mentioned that you were seeing some encouraging early stage measures of risk, and I think you cited specifically the early stage delinquencies. Is that what you\u2019re seeing in February? Because I guess looking at the two month delinquencies in the January file they look like they were still moving higher. And then secondly, with regards to your comment about not anticipating a need for additional meaningful reserves, were you referring specifically to meaningful reserves in excess of write-offs or meaningful reserves period?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Well, on the first question of course our monthly securitization filings are filed in the month following the activity. And so the filing just made was with respect to January activity and in January delinquencies were still sequentially on the move. And you\u2019ll see delinquencies on the move in February as well. It\u2019s the early stage that is showing signs of  - more than showing signs, it is stabilizing and improving. And so you\u2019ll see that stabilize in the first layers of reported delinquencies in our February, March, April filings filed March, April, May. Again there\u2019s a lag effect in when you see that.", "Separately with respect to my reserve comment we just added hugely to the reserve in excess of write-offs in Q4. What I intended to convey was the in Q1 I would expect that our expense running through the P&L will roughly approximate the $300 million in write-offs that we expect to report during the quarter. Therefore I do not expect the reserve to change much, plus or minus, in Q1.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "", "And then with regard to and I realize it may be difficult to predict for the full year, but your intentions in terms of receivables growth roughly for the full year, do you think it will be roughly in line with sales or below sales growth?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "No, I tried to convey earlier in my remarks that we very specifically expect receivables to decline in 2009. We have taken some very tough love steps with this portfolio and that has significantly curtailed the year-over-year growth, sequentially as we moved throughout 2008 you\u2019re going to see the portfolio give or take in line with prior year levels in Q1 \u201909. And it is highly likely that Q2, Q3, Q4 \u201909 we will have a lower amount of gross receivables on the books than we had Q2, Q3, Q4 \u201908 with the gap likely widening as the year progresses.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "", "So should we be thinking sort of sales rate less, what, 500 basis points? Is that a good starting point?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "I think that the dynamic is a lot more driven by factors other than sales. The dynamic in this portfolio is a lot more driven by the significant decline in charge activity relative to receivables, offset to an extent by a more modest change in rates of payment. But to try to put a gauge on that certainly by the end of the year you could see this portfolio year-over-year decline in the $0.5 billion to $1 billion range in gross receivables. We\u2019ll be able to provide more clarity on that obviously as the year progresses, but from today\u2019s vantage point that would be the likely range of gross receivables balances year-end \u201909 versus year-end \u201908, down $500 million to $1 billion.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.", "", "And then finally if things play out as you expect or hope in the first half for the year on credit would you expect that in the back half you could see reserves below write-offs?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Certainly that will occur at some point in the future. It could occur as early as the back half of 2009.

One is if you think about the SG&A dollars, Doug you\u2019ve done a great job on that, but it sounds like it\u2019s going to grow a bit this year. How should we think about that? Is it still going to grow less than square footage growth or is there something else in there we need to be watching? Then a follow-up on the comps.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Well, I think that SG&A is likely to grow at or slightly above square footage growth but not by a country mile. The tendency will be to grow faster than square footage not slower.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "", "And what changes this year that drives that? Is there inflationary costs or?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Well, we obviously have inflation every year and a lot of costs. This year we\u2019ve done a great job overwhelming those inflationary pressures. A couple of things unique to 2008 that were beneficial to SG&A in \u201908 that are not likely or at least hopefully in one case won\u2019t recur. Clearly there was a shortfall is the kind word to use here in incentive compensation. We have a set of pay for performance plans and the performance wasn\u2019t there and therefore we didn\u2019t accrue the pay. I would hope that 2009, speaking as a participant and a shareholder, generates a P&L with more incentive pay in it.", "Separately, we did enjoy the benefits in 2008 of some favorability in older layers of our workers compensation accruals that could recur in 2009 but that\u2019s actually created a bit of a benefit in each of the last two years. Was not a big issue year-over-year, \u201908 versus \u201907, but I would not expect that one to recur in \u201909 as well.", "In between the two of those that will clearly put some pressure on SG&A assuming performance is there. Otherwise only the workers compensation issue will flow through.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "", "And then on \u2013 you talked about mid single digit negative comps on the first half. Kathy and Gregg, could you put that into context? Is that what you\u2019re planning to buy for and should we assume that the mix is the same where food and consumables are still maybe up a little bit but everything else is down 8 to 10%? Or what are you planning for in a buy I guess is the question?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Yes, I would describe the negative mid single digit comp decrease with a very wide range of outcomes in our various business units. In our food and healthcare businesses, they continue to perform very, very well and that change would be in the upper mid single digit comps and in some cases in the upper double digit comp range. On the highly discretionary side in home and apparel and maybe in some cases our lawn and patio business we\u2019re looking at mid double digit comp decreases. So the range of businesses would fall in between those kinds of parameters. And that\u2019s how we have purchased for the spring season. We are very conservative in apparel, home and seasonal categories where there is significant markdown risk. And so those businesses are on average high single digit or low double digit comp decreases. ", "And the majority of our non-discretionary categories are very short cycle, so we can get back into those very, very quickly. And there\u2019s no reason for us not to plan that business other than optimistically because we want to be in stock 100% of the time and not miss a sale in food, commodities, and health and beauty.

Morgan relationship. And as far as I recall there was the formal trigger point at which they would get less interest and would formally have the rights to kind of help with the management of the credit card. Could we just see how far we actually are? I know we kind of get closer near the end on this but I wonder if we can get a little bit closer on specifying how far away we are from that trigger point. ", "And the second question I get asked by clients a lot which is if the J.P. Morgan relationship could be interpreted as a non-recourse debt financing, would you consider walking away from the receivables and the debt? And if not, why not?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "", "Well, I think the answer to the second question lies in the answer to the first question. This portfolio on a cash basis is returning hundreds of basis points higher than the point at which J.P. Morgan-Chase\u2019s return is capped. You may recall that there are a couple of levels of performance above that at which at a first layer there are some pre-authorized accounts underwriting and in risk management controls that are triggered. ", "And at a level in between that first trigger and the point at which their caps return is no longer earned, a degree of control changes hands in terms of risk management underwriting. But we\u2019re not near either or any of those. We are hundreds of basis points higher than the point at which J.P. Morgan and Target would no longer earn pro rata of the caps return defined in the transaction.

Thank you.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "", "Yes, the online performance was difficult for us in the fourth quarter. We had been experiencing very strong double digit increases and just like the retail side of the business, when the world turned in September, October we saw a pretty precipitous decline on the online business as well. That has somewhat strengthened as we\u2019ve got into 2009 so we\u2019re expecting modest growth in that business right now and clearly not as fast of growth as what we anticipated six or nine months ago, but better than it was in the early stages of fourth quarter.", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory.", "Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory", "", "Quick question on the credit, is there a certain spread that you try to maintain between the allowance for bad debt from the credit plus the charge-off rate?

Scovanner", "", "That is not going to be a stable relationship quarter-by-quarter because we carefully manage the assessments of the risks inherent in the portfolio in every quarter, and diligently try to estimate the future write-offs of the current receivables. And at quarter-end that happened to be just over $1 billion. Our future estimate of write-offs of the existing $9 billion plus in receivables is a little in excess of $1 billion. That is separated from a forecast of future write-offs because there will be some write-offs in \u201909 of receivables that haven\u2019t yet been created. We\u2019ll write-off some receivables in the back half of \u201909 based on loans made in the front half of \u201909, so of course it would be inappropriate to have that kind of allowance on our books at this point.", "Net net, the allowance that we have at the end of the year would correspond to a write-off rate, all else being equal, somewhere in the low to mid teens during 2009.", "Gregg W.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; please go ahead sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Good morning and welcome to our 2009 second quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Douglas Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Kathryn Tesija, Executive Vice President Merchandising. ", "During our call I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter performance in view of the current environment and Douglas will provide more detail about our financial results and outlook and Kathryn will share some insight about our guests and provide some of our key strategic initiatives and merchandise highlights for the fall season. ", "Finally we\u2019ll open the phone line for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today live via web cast. ", "Following this conference call John Hulbert and Douglas will be available throughout the remainder of the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. ", "We\u2019re very pleased with Target\u2019s second quarter financial results which were well above expectations. Profitability within our retail segment was quite strong due to impressive gross margin rate performance and disciplined expense control across the enterprise and our credit card segment generated profits in a quarter when most other card issuers have reported losses. ", "We continue to manage our business with thoughtful discipline, responsibly controlling both expense and capital investment to match the environment. At the same time we are maintaining a steadfast commitment to all our brands and a healthy appetite to invest when we see an opportunity. ", "We believe that the best way to emerge strong from the worst economic downturn in decades is to stay true to our strategy, while preserving appropriate financial flexibility. While our comparable store sales gap with Wal-Mart narrowed in the quarter by more than two percentage points compared with our first quarter, our top line performance particularly in discretionary categories remained our biggest challenge.", "Consumers remained cautious resulting in weak guest traffic and transaction size, retail prices especially in food and commodities continued to decline resulting in deflationary pressures and the economic recovery appeared to temporary stall as the country cycled the impact of last year\u2019s stimulus checks. ", "While I\u2019m not satisfied with our recent sales results, I am pleased with the resiliency of our business model in this environment and how our teams are executing our core strategies. We firmly believe that our expect more pay less brand promise is as relevant now as its even been and as a result we\u2019re aggressively pursuing initiatives in both merchandising and marketing that our reinforce our differentiated approach, as well as our strong value commitment. ", "In a few minutes Kathryn will describe in more detail several of our upcoming design partnerships that will create excitement throughout our assortments and some of the initiatives that will help drive traffic to our stores and convert guest visits into profitable sales. ", "But a few of our strategic efforts bear highlighting first, one of our most important strategic initiatives is our P-Fresh grocery format, which is now available in more than 40 new and remodeled stores. We continue to hear from guests that they love the assortment and visual appeal of this innovative concept and sales in these stores continue to meet or exceed our expectations. ", "Before year end we plan to have P-Fresh in over 100 Target stores as we continue to evaluate and refine the content adjacencies and visual elements. We also continue to consolidate and reposition our own brands to drive value for our guests and generate incremental sales and gross margin for Target.", "Later this fall we\u2019ll complete the phased introduction of our new Up and Up brand, which replaces Target brand as our core commodity\u2019s owned brand. Guest response to Up and Up has been very positive and is expected to continue to strengthen as guests become more familiar with the brand and more knowledgeable about the exceptional value of these everyday essentials. ", "Last month we rolled out our low price promise across the chain explicitly communicating that Target stores are now matching competitors\u2019 advertised prices on identical items in local markets. The program underscores the value of Target\u2019s everyday pricing and gives our guests the assurance that they don\u2019t have to compromise even when our competitors have an item on sale.", "And earlier this month we announced our plans to build and manage our own platform for Target.com reflecting our belief that an integrated multi channel strategy will be key to our future growth. We expect to launch our new site before holiday season 2011.", "I remain confident that Target is well positioned to grow profitably and deliver superior shareholder value over time. And I believe that we are effectively managing our business to compete and capture market share even in the current economic environment. ", "Though still early our back to school, back to college results are encouraging and our August month to date sales have shown modest improvement from recent trends. Before I turn the call over to Douglas, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank so many of you for your support in our proxy contest last May and for your willingness to engage with us on important strategic and governance issues. ", "We continue to keep your input top of mind as we move forward with our strategy. Now, Douglas will provide more detail on Target\u2019s second quarter financial results which we announced earlier this morning. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Thanks Gregg, in my remarks today I plan to discuss key aspects of second quarter performance in our two business segments and I\u2019ll provide some insight into our expectations for key metrics and overall earnings for the second half of the year. ", "As we announced this morning, Target earned $0.79 per diluted share in the second quarter. In light of our previously reported sales for the period, we are delighted with these results. Our retail segment continues to show surprising strength in generating gross margin and continues to reflect execution of thoughtful and disciplined expense controls.", "Separately our credit card segment continues to exhibit stability and modest profitability in stark contrast to the credit card results of nearly all other similar competitive card programs in 2009. Let\u2019s begin with a more detailed review of our retail segment for the quarter. ", "Our pace of sales remains challenging with comparable store sales down 6.2% in the quarter. Average transaction size contributed more to this result then did our traffic trends although each of these factors contributed to our sales decline. ", "In turn units per transaction had a greater impact on the change in the average dollar value of our transactions then did average selling price per unit. In light of this top line performance we were able to deliver much stronger profitability then we expected. Our gross margin rate expanded 70 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points year to date as we were able to more than offset the adverse sales mix impact in these periods, through remarkable margin rate expansion in many categories. ", "In isolation this mix impact would have been about 45 basis points in the quarter and more than 65 basis points so far this year, in other words factors beyond mix added a little more than one full percentage point to our gross margin rate in these periods. ", "As in any quarter rate improvements reflect a variety of ongoing efforts that Kathryn and her team pursue to drive retail segment profitability. About half of this quarter\u2019s category rate improvement was the result of meaningfully lower transportation costs, driven by a combination of lower crude oil costs, and transportation industry capacity dynamics. ", "Separately we\u2019re also beginning to experience cost reductions on a variety of products across a number of merchandise categories. As we move into the fall, some of these benefits are likely to moderate through sharper pricing and diminished year over year changes in energy costs. ", "On the expense side our retail segment turned in another outstanding quarter of performance. SG&A expenses declined slightly in overall dollars in the quarter, a remarkable achievement given the 71 additional stores we had open at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago. ", "This performance reflects disciplined execution and continued strong productivity improvements in our stores\u2019 organization. Year over year net timing issues were about neutral in the quarter. Turning next to our credit card segment, our second quarter and year to date results were fully consistent with the expectations we previously laid out. ", "Our overall profitability and return profile is good in an absolute sense and remarkably strong relative to others in this business. Quarter end gross receivables were down approximately $350 million or 4% from last year, consistent with our expectations. ", "Total card revenue as a percent of receivables was slightly higher than a year ago despite a significant decline in the prime rate during this period. The largest factor here is the yield benefit of the terms changes we\u2019ve implemented in response to the super harsh credit environment. ", "Net write-offs were $304 million in the second quarter in line with our expectations laid out six months which we reiterated three months ago. More importantly this experience is consistent with the reserve we had in place at the beginning of these periods. ", "All together the credit card segment delivered $63 million of free cash segment profit in the quarter. While this dollar profit was modestly below last year\u2019s level, the average of our capital invested in assets of this segment declined at a faster pace, both as a result of the JPMorgan Chase investment and the year over year decline in receivables I\u2019ve already discussed. ", "The result of these dynamics was a modest increase in our pre-tax credit card segment ROIC reflecting an annualized return of 8.8% this year compared to 8.2% last year. Looking forward to the final two quarters of the year, the single biggest variable in our enterprise remains the pace of sales in our retail business segment. ", "From a comparison standpoint last year\u2019s third and fourth quarter comparable store sales numbers create the potential for better year over year trends in the next two quarters even without any change in this year\u2019s run rate. This is most notable in the fourth quarter when we\u2019ll be comparing against a 5.9% comparable store sales decline in 2008.", "That said we continue to be cautious in our outlook in our fourth quarter inventory commitments are not based on any expected improvement in our sales trend other than the benefit provided by a relatively easier comparison. ", "And while it remains possible that fourth quarter comps could return to positive territory we\u2019re not counting on it. Focusing next on gross margin rate, we believe underlying trends of sales mix and margin rate within categories are likely to continue, although with different likely year over year outcomes in the next two quarters specifically we envision some gross margin rate compression in the third quarter followed by a return to gross margin rate expansion in the fourth quarter.", "On the expense side we continue to expect superb expense controls across the enterprise but clearly the year over year trends in dollars will not be as strong in the second half of the year due to some timing issues and especially because our expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were very lean, perhaps even too lean. ", "All in, we expect to turn in a very strong expense result for the fall and for the full year this likely will mean a low single-digit increase in expense dollars. In our credit card segment we expect year over year reductions in gross receivables to continue for the balance of this year and into 2010, perhaps down by a billion dollars or so by year end. ", "We expect our dollar delinquencies to continue to reflect stability or slight improvement and our write-offs in dollars will be similar in the next two quarters to the past two with some likelihood for a slightly better result in the third quarter. ", "Overall we expect to continue to produce appropriate profitability and returns on invested capital in this business segment. Finally I want to provide an update on our new store opening plans, in October we\u2019ll add our last wave of 2009 new stores and for the year in total we continue to expect to open about 75 new stores, adding just under 60 locations net of closings and relocations. ", "In our last two conference calls we\u2019ve indicated that we only had a handful of new store projects approved for 2010 but that we still had some flexibility to approve a small number of additional October, 2010 new stores. ", "We can now provide a more definitive picture of our 2010 program. As of today we expect to open a total of about 12 new stores in 2010 and will close or relocate two or three stores resulting in about 10 openings on a net basis. ", "A few final comments on cash flow and debt before we focus on EPS for the rest of the year, we continue to expect to generate in excess of $4 billion of cash flow from operations this year and continue to expect to reinvest a little over $2 billion of capital in our retail segment. ", "This means we\u2019re right on track to retire our debt maturities this year with internally generated cash flow, paid off our second and final large 2009 maturity subsequent to quarter end. As a result it remains likely that we would only approach the term debt markets this year if some unique opportunity were to present itself.", "Let\u2019s pull together all of these forward-looking statements to focus on our outlook for earnings generation, the current fall season median first call estimate is $1.49, which would lead to a full year earnings per share of approximately $2.97 in light of today\u2019s reported results. ", "We believe this represents a reasonable single point estimate for the year but importantly though, if our fall results turned out to be exactly $1.49 I think we would likely exceed the current fourth quarter median estimate of $1.04 by several cents and fall short of the current third quarter estimate of $0.45 by a similar amount. ", "Now Kathryn will share some of the key merchandise initiatives we\u2019re pursuing in the third quarter and throughout the holiday season. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "Thanks Douglas, as you\u2019ve already heard this morning, our sales continued to be led by strong trends in our need based categories which continue to generate positive comps and gain market share. ", "The overall sales trend remained challenging in the quarter as our comparable store sales softened more than two percentage points compared to the first quarter. This change was driven in equal parts by slower traffic and lower transaction amounts as our guests remained cautious in their shopping behavior. ", "Our latest guest research provides insight into the drivers of our sales. Our best guest continues to curtail their trips to Target as they are cutting back their discretionary trips in order to meet their budget needs. ", "In addition weekend trips for our best guests have declined more than weekday trips making a mind set and behavioral shift as guests now focus their shopping more on need then entertainment which has the impact of skewing purchases more towards need based commodity and food items, and less toward discretionary wants in apparel and home. ", "Our research also indicates that guest satisfaction with Target continues to be among the highest in the industry, that Target\u2019s price perception in the marketplace particularly in our everyday pricing is improving, and that store loyalty from our guest remains high as we continue to gain affluent guests from department stores. ", "With the great focus on needs based shopping trips its not surprising that healthcare, food and beauty continued to be among our strongest categories delivering comparable store sales increases even in the face of overall traffic declines. ", "In healthcare we continued to grab share from other channels and are seeing big increases in script volume due to our $4.00 and $10.00 generic programs. Our pharmacy rewards program also continues to gain momentum. Participants in this program visit more often and spend more on each visit. ", "Beauty sales are benefiting from the introduction of new technology and new brands and affluent aging populations, and guest migration from department stores and even while we\u2019re experiencing price deflation on some food items, the grocery category continues to see positive comps overall benefiting from increased space and emphasis in our general merchandise stores and continued development of new products in our own brands, which now account for more than 20% of our food sales. ", "In contrast our more discretionary home and apparel categories continued to be softer than the rest of the store in the second quarter. Overall comp sales in these categories declined in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Our strongest results in apparel were in performance active wear and newborn infant, toddler categories, while we saw particular softness in shoes and women\u2019s apparel. ", "And while our apparel sales trends are still not where we want them to be, we are pleased that the gap between the apparel sales and the rest of the store narrowed in the quarter. In home we saw relative strength in seasonal categories including back to school items with below average performance in decorative home and garden particularly in patio furniture, a category we had planned very conservatively for the year. ", "In addition to our intense focus on driving top line growth, we continue to conservatively manage our inventories to help us navigate the challenging sales environment while delivering supply chain efficiency, maintaining appropriate in stock levels, and improving gross margin rates.", "We are employing both SKU reduction and segmentation strategies to achieve these results and simultaneously reducing store labor and clearance markdowns. We exited the second quarter with inventories in very good condition, which has contributed to our favorable markdown rates, margin performance, and overall profitability. ", "As we make plans for the next few quarters we know that even though our sales in discretionary categories are soft at the moment, they are key to our long-term success because of the value they bring to our guests, our brand, and our profitability. ", "Throughout the fall season we\u2019ll continue to demonstrate our commitment to differentiated content and provide compelling reasons for guests to shop at Target with the introduction of several new upcoming designers. Our August assortment features new design partnerships including; a new jewelry collection by Anna Sheffield that offers unique sterling silver designs all priced at $49.99 or less for a limited time only. ", "Jay Hersh and her Hollywood Intuition collection in accessories, Hersh brings her iconic flare to Target as the founder of Intuition Boutique in Los Angeles, a favorite shopping destination for Hollywood\u2019s most famous celebrities and fashionistas. The line will be available at least until spring 2010 and plays on the most popular trends that our guests are seeing in magazines making them attainable and affordable. Prices for the line range from $3.00 to $30.00. ", "In September we welcome world renowned fashion icon Anna Sui for our second designer collaboration collection available in stores and on Target.com for five weeks. We are thrilled to offer her vibrant, pop culture inspired collection with its vintage influences and sophisticated nuances to our guests at a great value. ", "And I\u2019m excited that Target is the exclusive mass retail partner for Pearl Jam\u2019s ninth studio album, Backspacer. We forged a unique partnership with the band that allows the album also to be sold online and in independent music stores, respecting the band\u2019s fans first philosophy while delivering unique value for Target guests.", "The first single debuted at number two on Billboard\u2019s rock chart and the album has no signs of slowing down. Later this year Target is partnering with acclaimed handbag designer Carlos Falchi to launch a limited addition handbag collection, Carlos Falchi for Target.", "The line features the designer\u2019s vivid combinations of color, pattern and texture in deep hues and jewel tones on signature silhouettes. The hobos, satchels, shoulder and messenger bags in shades of plum, teal, brown, black and grey, are elegant yet functional with their interior compartments and pockets large enough to fit everyday needs. ", "The exotic collection features Falchi\u2019s iconic techniques and prints with intricate stitching details at amazingly affordable prices ranging from $19.99 to $49.99. The collection will be available at Target stores and on Target.com beginning early November through the end of December. ", "Beyond our fashion programs we\u2019re focused on driving excitement and traffic with our third quarter seasonal programs. Our back to school and back to college campaigns are off to a good start. Month to date our August sales are slightly above our expectations and this year\u2019s pricing environment appears to have moderated in terms of promotions and intensity. ", "In these key seasonal programs we\u2019re featuring the products students want most, and that appeal to our guests\u2019 budgets. From school basics to the latest fashions, to unique designer partnerships, like the drawer for Target home collection, guests can trust Target to deliver an exceptional, affordable shopping experience. ", "We\u2019re driving traffic and sales during this key season through our circulars, direct mail incentives and for back to college, a much more aggressive social and online media mix. We\u2019ll continue the seasonal excitement with Halloween, where we\u2019ll capitalize on the fact that Halloween and all the parties will fall on a Saturday this year. ", "We\u2019ll show our guests how to throw a great party for less with many party favors and accessories under $3.00 and our exclusive [Scholanimals] theme, we\u2019ll create a differentiated one stop entertaining shop and a strong value message. ", "We\u2019re also focusing on initiatives to build on our current success in our frequency businesses. In our pharmacies we\u2019re growing our top line through a combination of service, compelling loyalty programs, and strategic account acquisitions. ", "When combined with the cost savings achieved through more efficient operations and optimized store pharmacy hours, we\u2019ve generated the necessary resources to more effectively market this key business. As a result we\u2019re launching an unprecedented integrated marketing campaign to drive even greater awareness for our pharmacy services and convert more Target guests into Target pharmacy guests.", "The campaign features our first ever pharmacy TV spot, extensive online advertising and online videos with pharmacists answering common pharmacy questions. These efforts will help contribute to store wide sales growth as loyal pharmacy guests are some of our best guests in terms of frequency and basket size. ", "And as Gregg has already mentioned we continue to expand our commitment to grocery with the planned expansion of P-Fresh. P-Fresh will roll out to more than 30 Target stores in the Philadelphia market over the next two months and we intend to incorporate this expanded food offering into a substantial portion of our chain over the next three years dramatically improving our ability to deliver the convenience of a one stop shopping experience for our guests.", "We continue to leverage our innovative culture, collaborative teams, disciplined execution, and brand equity to address the challenges of the current environment and best meet the needs of our guests. ", "We remain committed to delivering an exceptional, affordable every day shopping experience to satisfy loyal Target guests, attract new guests, drive trips, and generate profitable sales. Now Gregg has a few concluding remarks. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "As you can see we\u2019re aggressively pursuing initiatives to drive results across our business in what continues to be a very challenging retail environment. We are confident that we have the right strategy and the right team to execute this strategy and we believe our efforts will produce profitable market share growth and generate superior shareholder value in the months and years ahead. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks, now we will be happy to respond to your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Congratulations on a really well managed second quarter, in terms of your guidance for gross margin, could you just comment a little bit more with respect to your directional guidance on Q3 being down slightly, Q4 being up in the context of how you originally forecast in Q1 and Q2, meaning before you delivered upside, is the same possibility out there for Q3 or what would be causing the pressure downward as opposed to what happened in Q1 and Q2.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "As I mentioned in my remarks about half of the gross margin rate expansion in Q2 that was unrelated to mix was driven by favorable transportation dynamics largely crude oil year over year and secondarily transportation industry dynamics. Crude oil averaged about $130.00 a barrel in the second quarter last year and fell quite significantly in Q3 so the year over year transportation benefit clearly is not likely to be as strong in Q3 this year as it was in Q2 this year. ", "Separately our plans have always envisioned a decline in Q3 followed by a rebound in Q4 in gross margin rate year over year given the base of performance in last year\u2019s Q3 and Q4. Excluding mix we had a good strong performance in Q3 last year, excluding mix we had a very weak performance in Q4 last year due to our markdown experience. ", "So stir all those dynamics together I think it is more likely then not that we\u2019ll have gross margin rate declines year over year in Q3 and more likely then not we\u2019ll have gross margin rate in expansion in Q4 year over year. ", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "And then in terms of second half opportunities and thinking more specifically about electronics and entertainment given the Circuit City liquidation and some other trends in that category do you see that as an opportunity for Target to take some share. If so is it in certain categories and then on apparel performance, it sounds like your performance apparel was a standout in the second quarter, were there some changes to pricing that helped you drive additional volume in that category. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "First on your question with electronics and entertainment, we have seen some nice share gains so far this year and I would anticipate that that would continue throughout the year given Circuit City and in addition some of the strength in the categories that we do well in. So TVs are performing exceptionally well, some of the computer peripheral product, some of the portable audio, so I do expect that we should have some nice share gains in the back half. ", "In terms of apparel, we have not had much decrease in pricing yet this year so some of the cost savings that we\u2019ve talked about already are really coming a little bit later in the year and those we would be reinvesting in price or in quality to make sure that we remain competitive in the marketplace, but not much in the second quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "The credit portfolio has been coming along nicely, yields are up, we saw with the filing this morning that the early stage delinquencies, it ticked up a little bit which I think was in part just because the denominator is shrinking, the portfolio is shrinking, and I\u2019m just curious as we look forward what would you expect the delinquency rates to do as the portfolio shrinks and what are the implications for the reserve.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I don\u2019t think that delinquency rates are likely to change materially in the fall with the one exception of course the rates have a seasonal pattern as the denominator grows in the holiday season and dollar delinquencies do not. I\u2019m very comfortable with our current reserve. I think it appropriately balances between the enthusiasm I might get looking at the fact that our dollar delinquencies are about $100 million lower today then the were in say February offset by the fact that unemployment rates continue to rise and are likely to continue to rise in the next several months. ", "Bankruptcies are up considerable year over year, recoveries of gross write-offs are down, payment rates remain stubbornly low and so forth and so I think that the reserve that we\u2019ve established is the right reserve in light of the balance between those opportunities and risks. ", "Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "And just a follow-up question, you outlined your store plan for next year, I\u2019m just curious with the P-Fresh initiative and the remodels you\u2019ll be doing how we should think about CapEx for next year in terms of maintenance CapEx versus new store CapEx. ", "", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Well we haven\u2019t put out any specific guidance for 2010 CapEx at this point obviously in light of our store count discussion; the sub component of our CapEx to build new stores will likely be lower next year than this year. ", "I stress the word likely because in any given year we typically lay out a lot of capital to build the following year stores and so it remains to be seen how large our 2011 plan would be and how much of a contributing factor that could turn out to be to 2010 new store CapEx. But we\u2019ll be taking a comprehensive look at our P-Fresh program over the next couple of months and together with our Board we\u2019ll determine the pace of remodeling activity that seems appropriate in light of the results as a starting point.", "I think it\u2019s a responsible benchmark to think of 2010 CapEx in the aggregate as being the same, maybe a little higher than this year with some meaningful movement among the sub components. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "On inventories, I was a little bit surprised to see total inventories up year over year and inventory days up, although the inventories per store were pretty flat. I was expecting a little bit more of a reduction, is there anything behind that. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "No I think from my standpoint the answer to the question was imbedded in one of the facts you cited, square footage is up 5.3% year over year and inventories are up 2.9%. I mean we certainly don\u2019t directly control the pace of sales in the short run and so inventory to sales certainly are going to deteriorate in any period in which our same store sales are as weak as they were in Q2. ", "On balance inventories are in great shape at this point. ", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Just secondly on the gross margin it was certainly an impressive performance but your sales performance particularly when comparing to some other value retailers, like TJ Maxx, Ross, Wal-Mart, hasn\u2019t been as impressive and I\u2019m a little puzzled as to first of all why you\u2019re not getting better sales given that you\u2019re a value retailer and secondly why you\u2019re not using the strong gross margin growth to either reinvest in further price improvements or highlight value more aggressively instead of passing it through to the bottom line. So my two questions are first of all, what\u2019s you\u2019re impression of why you\u2019re not necessarily getting the recognition on value that you deserve, is it perception or reality and secondly will you do something about it and if so will it be different to what you\u2019ve done in the past. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "As I said in my remarks, we are disappointed in our top line performance. Clearly we have a great value proposition and we want to remain and have been competitive from a price standpoint so, we felt that it was appropriate to reinvest in lower prices, we\u2019ve done so yet we don\u2019t want to go below where the market it.", "So some of that savings does go to the bottom line. We\u2019ve been working very aggressively trying to find the right and strike the right balance between our expect more pay less marketing message and its primarily a perception in the marketplace that our value proposition may not be quite as strong as some of the competitors that you\u2019ve cited.", "But our research says that the re branding campaigns and the broadcasts and the in store signing are starting to move the needle slightly. We\u2019re starting to see slight basis points improvement in our price perception vis-a-vie where we were in prior periods. So we believe that we\u2019re on the right track.", "We\u2019ve made the right adjustments. We believe that over time we\u2019ll continue to narrow that perception gap. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "I was just wondering if you could flush out your comments on August getting a little bit better. Is that traffic ticket, is that discretionary, just if you could elaborate there. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Well the commentary is, we are down 6.2% same store sales in the second quarter and so far early reads on back to school are more positive then what we\u2019ve seen in the past and as it relates to that run rate. ", "A lot of shifting dynamics during the back to school season, some state tax holidays were shifted from July into August, however the Labor Day moved one week later in the accounting calendar but overall we\u2019re starting to see some slight strengthening in both the traffic and transaction trends. ", "But I caution its very, very early and we\u2019re going to have to see how the back to school plays out. We think we\u2019ve put together a real strong back to school, back to college program. We\u2019ve been very aggressive on price. We believe we will gain market share during this timeframe and its our expectation and we\u2019re really planning to have some improvement in our same store sales compared to the last quarter. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "And to your discretionary question this trend in our discretionary items is less negative so far this month, but I\u2019d reiterate Gregg\u2019s caution, we\u2019re two weeks down and 11 to go in the third quarter.", "Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "And then on the gross profit line, I was wondering if we could go a layer deeper and learn what product categories are delivering the best margin rates and your outlook for the back half for those same categories. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll talk about specific categories, but I will tell you that across the board we continue to work on offering better gross margin in every division across the board to help offset some of our mix challenges. And we\u2019re doing a number of things to be able to do that. ", "So things like SKU reduction, we\u2019re down about 5% this year which helps us get product out of the back room and save on labor from the stores. It also helps us reduce markdown expense. It also helps on the sales side by being able to put more facings out for those things that are selling best.", "We have a number of segmentation strategies that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, things like volume segmentation, really going after high volume stores but conversely low volume stores making sure that we\u2019re editing that assortment, getting those inventories out of those stores to avoid some markdowns. ", "We have some geography segmentation strategies, climate, so a number of different things that are really helping us across the board improve our gross margin. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Let me just add to Douglas\u2019 comment regarding the transportation and fuel, that has helped every one of our businesses so we see a natural rate expansion due to the transportation costs, whether its apparel or home or in the hard lines category. ", "And then as Kathryn said, inventories have been exceptionally well managed throughout the spring season so we\u2019ve managed the markdown rates. On the other hand consumers are slightly more promotionally sensitive so we\u2019re seeing sales in our ad products being slightly more aggressive, consumers are using more coupons, so that is a dynamic that\u2019s working against it. ", "But in total all of our businesses performed very, very well. The teams are very focused on acquisition costs and markdowns and managing the business and it was really across the board performance in terms of the rate expansion. ", "Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then just on P-Fresh, I know its still pretty early but, and the two Minneapolis stores I know have done double-digit type comp increases, at least they were a month ago, just wondering if you could give a little bit of sense for the 40 that you have out there right now, what kind of comp lift you\u2019re seeing and expectations for potential comp lift out over the next year or so. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "The 40 that we have out there, 40 plus, about half are new stores, half were remodels, so its hard to evaluate the new stores, the new stores out of the blocks are doing quite well but because they weren\u2019t open prior to this its relative to what our expectations were. The remodels have been a combination of store sizes, volume and geographic locations.", "We continue to be pleased with the results on an overall portfolio basis. Some have been exceptionally strong in the double-digit range like we\u2019ve experienced in one of our Minneapolis stores, others have been in the high single-digits, others have been in the mid single-digits.", "And its dependent upon when we completed the remodel, what the volume of that store was, and how big of a grocery expansion that particular store got because the existing store base has a garden variety sizes of food. In some cases where we are expanding our food footprint 200% we are seeing a much larger increase in sales lift then in more recently built stores where the increase commitment to food is much less then that. ", "So it\u2019s a little bit of everything but overall the portfolio performance in all 40 of these stores have been very, very solid. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller - William Blair ", "Mark Miller - William Blair ", "I was hoping you could expand on your recent customer research with the perception closing in on what you believe is the reality, can you tell us, and you said it was a few basis points, but if that gap had been a 10, how much have you closed it and just a little bit more on which initiatives you think have been most valuable in that improvement and then also with the markets with the low price promise, do you have specific research there in terms of how much that\u2019s helped and is this a meaningful factor as we roll that through the system going forward.", "Kathryn Tesija ", "So if I can start with where you ended the low price promise is actually in all stores but it did roll out mid-July so we don\u2019t have specific research about that campaign. But we have been adding signing throughout our store just talking about our pricing and outside of the promise for some time so whether that\u2019s in soft lines, adding signs that talk about amazing deals or other things in hard lines, we have been expanding that for some time.", "So overall where we\u2019re getting credit from our guests in the guest research is really on every day prices and while I would say its still early for us to tell at least, we\u2019re pleased that its moving in the right direction and happy that its coming on our every day prices because I think that shows that our guest is starting to gain confidence that as we\u2019re saying we\u2019re shopping thousands of items that you don\u2019t have to. ", "They\u2019re recognizing that yes, our prices are great and giving us credit for that. There were several other changes we made earlier in the year particularly in our circular by reducing the number of SKUs we have in the circular, blowing up the pictures, larger size and then really hitting those price points harder with harder hitting headlines as well.", "So its not just the low price promise signing that\u2019s gone up but other initiatives have enhanced our price perception as well. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair ", "Could you talk about the trends in payables, its come down relative to inventories, really over the last two years but the year to year decline was a little bit greater, so what are the factors there, is there a calculation too that by paying suppliers quicker you could be getting better terms from them, better pricing and is that a factor in the gross margin experience as well. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "No I think this is a much more fundamental issue with negative same store sales, our inventory turns are slowing down and that has a natural adverse effect on the payables to inventory relationship. If we could sell our inventories super fast we would sell them before we pay for them but that\u2019s not the case in an environment where we\u2019re running negative same store sales. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair ", "If I look at the selling price per unit, down 1.2%, that\u2019s about a 200 basis point decline from the first quarter how much of that do you think is coming from a decline in items like for like items versus a shift in the mix.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "", "As you know we only attempt to measure that with any degree of precision once a year. I personally believe with some anecdotal information not precise facts at our fingertips that those trends are more driven by sales mix then by any other factor. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "Did the gross margin benefit this quarter from the SKU reduction that you spoke to, the 5% decline? ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "We also reduced SKUs last year, so yes, it did. ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "And quick question on the incremental five stores for next year, you originally talked five now you\u2019re talking 10, can you give us a sense on how good the ROI looks that gives you the confidence to build then now versus waiting a little bit later.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "You have to appreciate the twinkle in my eye, its actually an incremental seven, the five we talked about before was gross and now we\u2019re up to 12 gross. Certainly we are being very careful in this environment to approve stores that meet one of two fundamental criteria; they either are stores in which we have great confidence in achieving very strong returns, which gives us a margin for error, if we\u2019ve misjudged the sales equation.", "Or in the alternative stores that are in impossible to replicate locations deals if you will that we\u2019ve been working on for many, many years that to turn them down now would be to turn down the only opportunity in individual trade areas for many, many years to come. ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "And then on the credit business given the aggressive nature on the average balance reductions, can you talk about how that\u2019s impacting your comp today. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Well when you say the aggressive actions, we\u2019re taking actions that are consistent with the actions taken by other leaders of similar portfolios and the reason I start there is that the larger impact on our comps is driven by tightening of among third party operators of cards that are used in our store. ", "There is some seasonality to this metric but about a third of our sales are one someone\u2019s credit card, ours or someone else\u2019s. About six points of the total on our cards. So we have 25% to 30% of our sales on the cards of others. There\u2019s a disproportionate amount of our discretionary sales of course that are charged on cards and so its hard to know which way the correlation or causation I should say runs as to whether tightening credit is putting pressure on the discretionary sales or if the fact that discretionary sales are low is causing a decrease in the penetration on credit cards in our overall picture.", "Net, net I think if you really stretch the assumptions our own tightening on our own cards is potentially theoretically contributing a half a point or more to our same store sales decline but it clearly is not the dominant factor in traffic or ticket. ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "Can you talk a little bit about approvals and what\u2019s happening year over year and average approved balance within credit? ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I would segregate your question into two different issues, one is our approval rates are down not necessarily because we\u2019re tightening but rather having to do with the mix of applicants. Separately all else being equal we are tighter on balances as we manage the risks and as we very carefully differentiate state by state in our underwriting models using a combination of purchased data, think of credit bureau data if you will or FICO data, together with some very carefully assembled proprietary models that are unique to each geography.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "And then when you talked about a billion dollar potential to be lower year over year what are you looking for to start pulling back on the range of the credit contraction, is it going to be a write-off rate or delinquency trend, how are you thinking about that looking forward.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "We have always managed this business with a view to strengthen and deepen our guest relationships but to only be willing to invest provided we earn an adequate return on invested capital. So the key to your question is the dynamics of return on invested capital. I mentioned some of the headwinds earlier; certainly another major league industry headwind is the most recent credit card legislation which is about as anti-stimulative as anything Congress had touched here in 2009.", "Its going to cause us and other industry participants to think about how to restore the damage that will be done later this year and into 2010 to ROICs due to the aspects of that legislation that adversely impact profitability of all card portfolios like this one. So bottom line, we need to get the confidence that we can earn a proper return on invested capital to one to return to growing this asset category. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Going back to the traffic as you\u2019ve been rolling out P-Fresh and doing that greater advertising to get people back to the stores, what do you think really drove the sequential slowing in traffic. Do you think the stimulus last year had something to do with that, if you look at the deceleration in traffic from first quarter to second quarter. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I think that\u2019s a responsible hypothesis, P-Fresh of course is not yet large enough across 1,719 stores to have a meaningful or even very much of a measurable impact in consolidation. At the margin of course its positive but its just not big enough yet. I wish we knew with precision exactly what had caused the slowdown in traffic because if we did we could devise a plan that turned it around in 30 days. ", "", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "So and if we go ahead, the things in the back half that you listed, those are the key things to driving traffic, it\u2019s the advertising, its getting that message out there. And you\u2019re seeing some early signs that\u2019s working. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Two weeks into 26 in the back half of the year and yes the trend is better, but again, that is partially, its truthful but the comment is tongue in cheek. ", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And then you also mentioned that in the back half you expected SG&A dollars to start rising again, and said it could be single-digits. Do you want to give a little more clarity on that, especially given, I know there were some timing issues in terms of ad spend. ", "", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Yes I would stress low single-digit increases, but certainly three or four things come to mind in terms of the year over year comparisons that are likely to put us into increases in SG&A for the back half of the year. Marketing timing is clearly one of them. We expect to spend more as a percent of sales in Q3 and Q4 this year then we did last year. ", "For the year our marketing plan is right on but we\u2019ve saved some money here in the front half for the express purpose of being able to invest it in the back half. Incentive compensation expense was actually a credit to expenses last year. We started out with quite strong performance Q1, Q2 and ended up with very poor performance Q3 and Q4 and reversed back into income incentive compensation accruals.", "So year over year that clearly is a headwind. Workers\u2019 Compensation expense Q3 last year we disclosed a one-time beneficial adjustment to our reserves. If such an adjustment were to recur I wouldn\u2019t expect it in the same size. And finally I mentioned in my own remarks that our store based productivity was so strong in Q4 last year that we clearly do not expect the same degree of year over year performance in Q4 that we are likely to have enjoyed all the way through Q3.", "In some respects I think we got beyond what we were comfortable with in Q4 last year so the degree of benefit year over year in Q4 will not be the same. Those are the four items that come to mind.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If you could just follow-up on the last point in terms of the marketing timing as it relates to the pressure clearly going up in the third and in the back half, but perhaps give us a sense greater in the third or greater in the fourth how that balances out. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Well the third quarter is always a fascinating one as it relates to marketing and advertising as a percent of sales because the sales look a lot like Q1 and Q2 in Q3 and yet we\u2019re beginning to incur a lot of holiday related spending and so Q3 is always a seasonal peak in our advertising and marketing and this year we\u2019ve elected to exaggerate that trend. ", "So its net, net it\u2019s a couple of cents a share. This is not a huge issue but it is to those who count pennies it is a meaningful item. ", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then my second question relates to deflation, maybe talk about if you quantify some, the rate of deflation you\u2019re seeing in consumables, when you would expect that to perhaps peak and then shifting gears to apparel deflation, perhaps quantify there, it sounds as if its an opportunity in the back half. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "So on the consumables side its hard to say exactly when its going to peak but I would say its been most dramatic in the dairy category with milk pricing this year. And there has been some across food but I would say the bulk of it is really been in that particular category. ", "In apparel we\u2019ve talked about some of the cost decreases that we anticipate for this fall and how we\u2019ll reinvest that either in quality or into pricing. So I think still to be determined exactly how much that will be and can\u2019t tell you when that will peak because we haven\u2019t finished costing out spring yet so don\u2019t know if spring will be similar to fall or something different. ", "But we do want to reinvest that money to be able to remain competitive and make sure that we have compelling offers on the floor. ", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then on the consumables deflation, any quantification there you could share with us. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Not really, its like anything you have some ups and some downs, and overall its more anecdotal then anything based on the number of items we track from year to year but there\u2019s more downs right now but its really hard to put a number on it because it\u2019s a moving target and some are met with competitive responses and so the gap narrows and others aren\u2019t so its pretty hard.", "But in total as Kathryn said, food commodities and apparel are all collectively showing more deflationary pressure then inflationary pressure and why we\u2019d love to drop some or all of the bottom line we know that\u2019s not reasonable. So number one priority is to be competitive in the marketplace. Number two is to make sure that we\u2019re improving the quality and the style and design where we think its appropriate and then three, would be to allow some of those additional savings to fall to the bottom line if its possible. ", "So we\u2019d like all three of those things to happen. We\u2019re just not sure at this point what combination of how those events are going to unfold.", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "In terms of the competitive pressure or competitive environment we saw obviously impressive margin expansion here, Wal-Mart as well strong gross margin showing perhaps give us a sense of how competitive is it out there and also what response you\u2019re seeing as you\u2019ve been now promoting this low price promise in the stores, what kind of competitive response you would expect. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "I would say that overall the competitive environment is fairly rational, its stable, back to school pricing is actually slightly more rational then last year or less deeply negative then it has been so that is a good sign. ", "That\u2019s the mix of competitors from Wal-Mart, Kohl\u2019s, Penny\u2019s, and Office Superstore give or take some more, some less, but overall slightly less competitive then what we\u2019ve experienced in prior years. The low price promise has only been out there for 30 days but the experiences that we\u2019ve had with our two test markets, continue in the short-term across the chain and that is that there are very relatively few adjustments being made at store level. So we\u2019re not, we\u2019re have been confident that our prices are right and we\u2019re seeing that our prices are right because there are very few adjustments being made.", "It might be one per store every couple of days so its relatively modest but we think this will be a terrific creditability builder and marketing umbrella to reinforce that we\u2019ve got strong values both every day and on sale.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; please go ahead sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Good morning and welcome to our 2009 third quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Douglas Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Kathryn Tesija, Executive Vice President Merchandising. ", "This morning I will provide a brief overview of our third quarter performance and the retail environment as we enter the holiday season, and Kathryn will highlight recent merchandising trends and provide a preview of our fourth quarter and holiday initiatives. And finally, Douglas will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail. ", "Following Douglas we\u2019ll open the phone line for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via web cast. ", "Following this conference call John Hulbert and Douglas will be available throughout today to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. ", "We are very pleased with Target\u2019s performance in the third quarter which exceeded our expectations and was the result of responsible planning and consistent execution of our strategy by teams across the company, reflecting a somewhat more stable environment and more compelling merchandise offerings, marketing campaigns, and strong store executions, our sales and guest traffic during the quarter increased modestly. ", "A notable improvement from our first half trend. We were able to translate these sales into higher retail profits due a combination of improved sales in discretionary categories, better margins within categories, and continued strong productivity gains in our stores. ", "And in our credit card segment, we delivered increased third quarter profitability while many other issuers in the industry continued to experience staggering losses. These results demonstrate the ability of our teams to manage our business profitably while preserving efficient flexibility to invest in opportunities that deliver value for all our guests and our shareholders. ", "P-Fresh, which offers a much deeper food assortment in our general merchandise stores including perishables, and an expanded offering of dry, dairy, and frozen items is one of these opportunities. We currently operate 108 stores in this format including approximately 30 stores that opened in Philadelphia last month. ", "Because we firmly believe this concept is a low investment, high [inaudible] way to add convenience for our guests and driver greater trip frequency, we committed to this initial 100-store pilot last year after a highly successful two-store test and when  many retailers were retrenching. ", "By carefully evaluating the number of items in each category this enhanced assortment includes 90% of the food categories and approximately 60% of the SKU\u2019s available in a Super Target store and the concept incorporates unique fixturing and visual elements that clearly convey our commitment to a credible food offering in a general merchandise format. ", "While it is still relatively early to make a definitive judgment on this format, we continue to be very pleased with our initial results and feel confident enough in its future potential to extend our rollout to an additional 350 stores in 2010. Douglas will talk more about the impact of this decision in a few minutes. ", "Target\u2019s unique combination of discipline and agility is part of our DNA. Its also the basis for our approach in this year\u2019s fourth quarter. In light of continued economic and consumer spending challenges, and given holiday shopping patterns that are increasingly concentrated in the two days after Thanksgiving and the week leading up to Christmas, we have planned our inventory levels appropriately. ", "We are also focused on delivering a superior shopping experience with highly engaged team members, fast checkouts, and strong brand standards while maintaining appropriate expense control and productivity growth in our stores and distribution centers. ", "Our early sales results for November provide additional justification for being cautious in this uncertain environment. While store traffic continues to increase moderately over last year, lower average unit retails are leading to a smaller average transaction, creating pressure on our top line sales. ", "While these early November results might end up being a retiming of sales until later in the season, the good news is that our conservative planning particularly in seasonal and discretionary categories positions us well in case that doesn\u2019t happen and our third quarter experience demonstrates that we can accommodate the upside if it occurs.", "Regardless of the environment we believe our plans for the fourth quarter are appropriately designed to capture profitable market share. As Kathryn will explain in more detail, we are aggressively pursuing in-store and online sales beginning with a one-day only sale on Target.com on Thanksgiving Day, our customary two-day sale in-store immediately following Thanksgiving and compelling Cyber Monday deals. ", "We have developed a strong marketing plan to support these events and drive traffic throughout December and we will be in stock and priced right on the most wanted items. We also remain keenly focused on reinforcing our pay less message and building on the progress we\u2019ve made this year in changing our guests\u2019 perception of Target pricing. ", "We\u2019ll continue to focus on prices more boldly in our circular, in our broadcast ads, and with improved signing throughout our stores. And we continue to backup these messages with our commitment to match Wal-Mart\u2019s prices locally on identical items through our low price promise. ", "Beyond the fourth quarter we\u2019re focused on maintaining a superior experience for our guests in introducing newness and differentiation that will continue to excite our guests and grow our top line sales. In addition to P-Fresh, we\u2019re testing new ideas across all of our businesses, some of which we\u2019ll discuss today and some we\u2019ll be sharing in the coming months. ", "All of these initiatives are designed to improve our guest shopping experience and drive profitable market share. Now Kathryn will provide more detail on our third quarter merchandising results and our plans for the holiday season. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "Thanks Gregg, our third quarter results demonstrate the relevance of Target\u2019s strategy with our guests and provides evidence that our merchandising, marketing and store experience continues to resonate. ", "As Gregg mentioned we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter performance. While overall sales are still not growing at our desired pace, we are encouraged by the continued strength of sales in food, healthcare, and beauty and by the improvement we experienced during the quarter in sales of discretionary categories, especially apparel. ", "Both our discretionary and non-discretionary businesses benefited during the quarter from an increase in guest traffic. In fact the number of store visits per guest increased during the third quarter for the first time in nearly two years. ", "We believe that this increase in frequency and improvement in our results is attributable to both internal and external factors, including a more stable though still challenging retail climate, our efforts to assure our guests that they do not have to pay more to shop at Target, and our unwavering commitment to deliver the merchandising excitement and exceptional service our guests expect when shopping at Target. ", "Let me describe some of the ways we continue to reinforce our expect more, pay less brand promise in the current environment. Even though we\u2019ve always delivered exceptional value to our guests, we have not always gotten credit for our outstanding prices. As a result in the past year we\u2019ve taken steps to underscore the value in our merchandise assortment and strengthen our price messaging.", "Specifically we have significantly enhanced our in-store signing to communicate price; expanded the number of items included in our competitive shop process, which ensures that we\u2019re priced right on thousands of items across the store; instituted our low price promise to match local competitors\u2019 advertised prices; reinforced our weekly circular to feature more commodities; and frequency driving merchandise to highlight bigger pictures and bolder price points and to showcase attention-grabbing value headlines; launched new more authentic but still brand right broadcast campaigns that reinforce Target\u2019s exceptional prices; allocated more space to non-discretionary categories in new and remodeled stores; and merchandised great values more boldly with fewer bigger items and stronger value message signing including mail aisle end caps, focusing on single price point items. ", "While we still have opportunity for further improvement we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we are making in changing our guests\u2019 perception to more closely match the reality of our affordable pricing. Expect more has always been a Target hallmark and even in the face of the current economic challenges, we remain committed to delivering newness and innovation throughout the store. ", "For example, during the third quarter we reinvented the way our jewelry assortment is presented. The area now features merchandise displayed on tables, rather then under glass and all product is priced under $50.00. The compelling assortment, more welcoming and convenient environment, and lower prices are improving the experience for our guests and driving profitable sales. ", "Electronics is another category where we continue to innovate and pilot new products and services. Programs we are currently testing include a full service cell phone solution which is being tested in about 100 stores; a TV delivery and installation service which is being tested in approximately 180 stores; and an iPod trade-in for Target Gift Cards which is available on Target.com. ", "While its premature to speculate on the opportunity these test programs offer, we\u2019re encouraged by early results and gaining valuable learning\u2019s from our efforts. The rollout of Up and Up, which represents the rebranding of our core commodity assortment formerly known as Target brand, leverages both halves of our expect more, pay less brand promise. ", "The new brand encompasses 800 products across 40 categories, offering national brand quality and an average savings of 30%. The brand\u2019s unique design, high quality, and low prices are resonating with guests and we are experiencing increases in both penetration and sales compared to last year. ", "In 2010 we plan to build on this success adding more than 100 new products to the line. Now I\u2019d like to turn our attention to holiday and the fourth quarter. The official kickoff of holiday is our two-day sale on the Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving. ", "Our intent this year is for Target to be the best place to shop for those wanting the best merchandise at the best prices. We\u2019ll open our doors an hour earlier this year at 5:00 am and feature door busters in a broad set of categories. ", "The shopping experience will be easy for our guests as stores will merchandise and market the door busters and other fantastic deals in can\u2019t-miss ways, such as end caps, bulk locations, and signing. In addition each store will provide guests with a two-day sale map to help them navigate all the great deals. ", "We expect a strong holiday season in our online business as guests leverage Target.com as a destination to research and plan both their online and in-store shopping. Guests who want to get an early start on some of the most aggressive prices of the season, can shop Target.com\u2019s online only event on Thanksgiving Day. ", "Or shop an array of offers on Cyber Monday.

In addition we\u2019ll offer incredible value and differentiation in trim a tree, including many items with lower price points then last year. ", "To assist our guests with their planning, we mailed our toy catalogue to five million homes and inserted it in 48 million newspapers on November 8, and in coming weeks many of our guests will receive holiday gift catalogues, or other direct mail from Target featuring great gift ideas at exceptional prices. ", "We also continue to partner with well-known designers to offer guests high-end fashion at an every day affordable price. For example, during the fourth quarter Target is launching a new limited addition handbag collection with acclaimed designer Carlos Falchi, and introducing our next go international line with Rodarte. ", "And to help our guests get in the holiday spirit, we\u2019re offering a dress collection that features a variety of versatile styles and dressier options designed to appeal to a broad range of guests, all for the incredible price of $39.99.

", "Whether during the fourth quarter or as we look to 2010, we continue to leverage Target\u2019s culture of differentiation, innovation, and collaboration to deliver products our guests want at prices that fit their budgets. These attributes combined with our disciplined execution will allow us to continue to deliver a shopping experience that satisfies our loyal Target guests, attracts new guests, drives incremental sales, and generates profitable sales. ", "Now Douglas will provide more detail on Target\u2019s third quarter financial results and our financial outlook for the fourth quarter.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Thanks Kathryn, in my remarks today I plan to discuss the performance drivers for both of our business segments in the third quarter and provide some insight into our expectations going into the fourth quarter and beyond. ", "As you\u2019ve already heard this morning, we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter performance. Our third quarter diluted EPS of $0.58 represents an increase of more then 18% over last year\u2019s third quarter and is well above the expectation we had going into the quarter. ", "This performance was driven by much better then expected profitability in our retail segment, combined with solid and improving profitability in our credit card segment. Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our performance in the third quarter, beginning with our retail segment. ", "Comparable store sales declined 1.6% for the quarter. While still negative this performance was somewhat less negative then we expected going into the quarter and much less so then the 6.2% decline we reported in the second quarter. ", "Among the key drivers of comparable store sales, traffic was up 0.6% in the quarter while average transaction amount declined 2.2% primarily due to a 1.6% decline in units per transaction. Our third quarter gross margin rate expanded 28 basis points, a little less then the 39 basis point expansion we experienced during the first six months of the year, but pleasantly surprising in light of last year\u2019s strong third quarter performance on this metric. ", "Our performance during the quarter reflected continued improvement in rates across a broad range of merchandise categories, partially offset by an 18 basis point adverse impact of sales mix. This was a much smaller sales mix impact then the 68 basis point headwind we experienced in the first half of the year. In fact, it\u2019s the smallest quarterly mix impact that we\u2019ve experienced in three years. ", "Third quarter retail segment SG&A expenses grew only 0.5% over last year resulting in favorable expense leverage in light of our 1.4% growth in total retail sales. The most important driver of our favorable SG&A performance continued to be strong year over year productivity growth in our stores, offsetting adverse performance on a few other expense lines including incentive compensation. ", "Depreciation and amortization expense grew about 15% in the third quarter much more quickly then the first two quarters of the year. This change from the prior trend is the result of recognition of accelerated depreciation on assets that will be replaced as part of our comprehensive 350-store 2010 remodel program that Gregg touched on earlier. ", "Overall EBIT in our retail segment grew by 2.4% or $19 million in the quarter to $791 million this year while EBITDA grew by 7.1% to over $1.3 billion in the period. Turning next to our credit card segment, this quarter we continued to experience results consistent with the expectations we\u2019ve discussed with you throughout this year. ", "And again this quarter those trends translated into solid profitability delivered from a somewhat smaller portfolio. Credit card segment profit grew to a very respectable $60 million in the quarter compared with $35 million last year. Period end gross receivables decreased 8.2% or $717 million from a year ago. ", "Total card revenue as a percent of gross receivables was down only slightly from last year reflecting a meaningful year over year decrease in the prime rate almost completely offset by the yield enhancing terms changes we\u2019ve implemented to compensate for enhanced risk in the current environment. ", "Net write-offs were $280 million in the quarter, in line with the guidance we\u2019ve provided throughout the year, most recently in the second quarter conference call. Now let\u2019s turn to our expectations for the remainder of the year. ", "There\u2019s no question that last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales results present an easier comparison then we have faced all year. Working against this more favorable fourth quarter backdrop, are the combined effects of the very weak macro environment and longer-term trends around diminished holiday shopping lists. ", "On balance while we continue to believe that its possible for us to deliver positive same store sales in the fourth quarter we think its more prudent to plan for a modest negative result in this key metric and we\u2019ve positioned our markdown sensitive inventory commitments with this in mind. ", "In turn, this approach should deliver a sharp and reliable increase in gross margin rates as we cycle over the corrosive clearance markdowns that we recorded in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Ultimately the magnitude of our net improvement in gross margin rates, will depend on other factors including our sales mix by category, and the intensity of the pricing environment. ", "On the SG&A expense line we continue to expect growth in the low single-digits for the overall year. However as we discussed last quarter, the unexpected strength of the last minute shopping in December last year created a staffing environment that was leaner then we had intended. ", "As we plan for this year\u2019s fourth quarter we expect great store productivity to continue but we do not believe its responsible to deliver the same year over year productivity improvement we\u2019ve seen through the first nine months of the year. ", "Combined with our current sales outlook this translates into an expectation of a mid single-digit increase in SG&A expense for the fourth quarter. Accelerated depreciation will have a similar dollar impact in the fourth quarter to that we recorded in the third quarter, but its impact on a rate basis will of course be somewhat lower because of the seasonality of our sales. ", "In the aggregate all of these factors should combine to drive strong increases in both retail segment EBITDA and EBIT in the fourth quarter. In our credit card segment, we\u2019ll continue to manage the portfolio very conservatively in light of the underlying risk environment and in preparation for the legislative and regulatory mandates imposed on the credit card industry, who\u2019s adverse impacts will begin to be measurable in our fourth quarter. ", "Despite these unwelcomed effects, we expect that our approach will continue to generate modest rates of portfolio profitability in the fourth quarter and into 2010. Seasonal factors will also contribute to somewhat lower profitability in this year\u2019s fourth quarter when compared with the quarter just ended. ", "But even modest profitability this year would compare very favorably with last year\u2019s loss in this segment. We continue to expect fourth quarter write-offs in the range of $300 million, above third quarter performance yet consistent with our first and second quarter experience and in line with our prior guidance as well. ", "We also continue to expect that year-end receivables will be about a billion dollars lower then at the same time last year. Before we leave credit cards, I should mention that we\u2019re looking at other possible innovations in our card program to drive future performance. For instance in October we began a test in two markets to understand how our guests would respond to a rather fundamental change to our current rewards program.", "In these test markets guests who used their Target card or Target Visa, or Target check card at our stores, received a discount on every purchase rather then accumulating points towards a periodic 10% off certificate that guests earn in the current programs. ", "Its early in the test, but we\u2019re encouraged with the response that we\u2019ve seen to date. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate the results to determine whether to modify our overall program in the future. Now let\u2019s turn to investment and cash flow. ", "In the second quarter call I outlined that we will have a lean new store program in 2010 with about 12 total new stores which will likely result in fewer then 10 additional locations net of closings and relocations. ", "Also as discussed in this call, we\u2019ve committed to remodel about 350 existing stores in 2010 at a total investment of just over a billion dollars. In concept about half of this investment is to add P-Fresh features to these stores and the other half is devoted to other enhanced merchandising concepts and to a general freshening of these stores, consistent with the objectives and magnitude of our remodel program in each of the past several years. ", "Overall we might reinvest something like $2.5 billion of capital in our business in 2010, up from about $1.8 billion or so this year. Taken in the context of the likely magnitude of cash flow generated from operations this means that we should be in a position sometime in 2010 to engage our Board in a discussion about lifting our temporary suspension of open market share repurchase activity. ", "If we were able to resume this activity next year we would continue to execute with a keen eye on maintaining our strong credit rating. Finally let me summarize our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter. ", "As of today, the current median first call estimate for Target\u2019s fourth quarter earnings per share is $1.12. I believe this figure lies within a range of potential outcomes, yet I also believe that many things would have to fall into place to meet or exceed this figure. ", "For important context, I would observe the related comment that in our view sell side analysts are somewhat more optimistic across most of our industry then we believe is warranted in light of the harsh realities of the current environment. ", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "We remain confident in our strategy and our team and continue to make listening to our guests a top priority. We also remain focused on offering affordable products for any budget and driving meaningful innovation across all of our businesses. ", "We\u2019re confident that Target will continue to deliver on our expect more, pay less brand promise in ways that resonate with our many diverse guest segments for months and years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks, now Douglas, Kathryn, and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Colin McGranahan \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "First question is really on the discretionary category and if you could maybe parse down a little bit what you\u2019re seeing in terms of units per transaction, through the third quarter and then into November, are people, have they been adding discretionary on the average trip or are they taking more trips with a more discretionary appeal to them. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Well in the third quarter they, actually there was a little bit of both of those dynamics. We saw an increase in traffic flows and within that increased traffic we saw a great propensity to buy discretionary items in the basket. In particular we saw our apparel business strengthen in the third quarter vis-a-vie other quarters. ", "Colin McGranahan \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And how has that behavior changed so far here in November. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Well again we\u2019re very early in the month but we have seen slightly softer sales in the first two weeks of the month and a little bit of give back in the discretionary category, but again we\u2019ve got a lot of season ahead of us and we think that this may be as much of a case of retiming of sales then anything. ", "We\u2019ve got a very strong plan for the fourth quarter in our discretionary categories and we think that we will continue to perform well on the discretionary side of the business. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "As you know we don\u2019t often like to talk about the weather here at Target but I think at this point we should make an exception to that practice. The weather helped us in October and clearly in hindsight accelerated some apparel sales that might have otherwise occurred here in early November. ", "So, lots of people love to complain about the weather. I would remind everyone that on average the weather by definition is average and we should benefit as often as we suffer. ", "Colin McGranahan \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And then just a quick follow-up any learning\u2019s you can talk about so far in the Philadelphia P-Fresh rollout and how that has influenced your thinking about the expansion next year. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Yes, there have been a lot of learning\u2019s so far and again, its very early so we hesitate to get into much detail as it relates to what\u2019s in the basket and the frequency and things like that. I think its just important to note that we are experiencing in Philadelphia the same kinds of strong performance characteristics that we have observed in our initial pilot stores and other new stores and remodel stores that we implemented throughout the earlier part of this year. ", "So the same kind of shopping dynamics exist where very, very strong sales in grocery, slight increases in the cross over categories and because its so early, we\u2019re seeing basically flat or up slightly in the discretionary categories. ", "But as you know we\u2019re going to have an analyst meeting in mid to late January in Philadelphia and we\u2019ll be able to share much more detail as it relates to guest insights and the shopping dynamics at that time. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "Just on the accelerated depreciation you said a similar amount in the fourth quarter, should we think about it is that we\u2019ll see a similar amount here in the first quarter and second quarter of next year as well. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "", "No it will trail off pretty significantly and in round numbers, in the aggregate its about $400,000 of assets per store so we\u2019re talking on the base of stores we\u2019re remodeling next year, about a $140 million plus or minus in assets that will be retired that had book value at the beginning of the quarter, at the beginning of our third quarter. ", "By the end of this year we will have recorded between $90 and $100 million of that total and that will leave $40 or $50 million in 2010. Obviously if we repeat this program in 2011 then we\u2019ll repeat this cycle of accelerated depreciation give or take in the last half of next year. ", "Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then on the P-Fresh, how much of the SKU increase is dry grocery versus perishables. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "The majority of the SKU increase is in the dry grocery area, I would say its dry, dairy, and frozen contribute the majority of the SKU increase. Clearly we\u2019ve added perishables but the perishable section is still relatively small in comparison to how deep we went in those other categories. ", "Charles Grom \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then on credit, you gave us the write-off of over $300 million, could you give us a little bit of color for the bad debt provision line, what you\u2019re thinking. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Well I said write-offs would approximate $300 million hate to be so picky with words, but I didn\u2019t say over $300, but the provision is something that we won\u2019t be able to determine until we get at the end of the quarter. ", "A lot of variables go into that calculation every quarter as we assess the risks in the then current portfolio but as a working proposition I would expect that the provision will likely be lower then write-offs in the fourth quarter by a fairly small amount. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Can you get a little bit more into the gross margin, its nice to see it continue to grow and we had a nice mix improvement with apparel coming back. How much of that mix improvement that was now only 18 as opposed to down 60 was because of that apparel coming back, or were there other factors that drove that improvement. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Most of that mix improvement was driven by collapse of the differential between our aggregate same store sales and the apparel same store sales performance. So those were reasonably in line with each other in the quarter in sharp contrast to any of the quarters in the last year and a half. ", "Home was less negative then it had been, but the big story in Q3 mix was apparel. ", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "So from where we are today, if we could keep this sort of difference of comp trend of the categories, do you think this headwind of negative 20 bps is a new ongoing run rate. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "No I think that that would require favorable weather as far as we can see. So again, I don\u2019t like to get too far into weather, but there\u2019s no doubt that our adverse mix impact was less adverse as a result of the acceleration of sales due to favorable weather. ", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And one thing that was interesting was on the ticket that the units seemed to drive more of it then deflation, is there any, was there something behind that especially if discretionary started to pick up, was it items in the basket or how\u2014", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I think that we\u2019re all going to need to adjust our thinking a bit moving forward, after all we\u2019re driving a lot more traffic to the stores with some fundamental and quite intentional changes in our strategy. And some of those trips involve fewer units. Its what we\u2019re trying to do. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Maybe just a little bit more specifically on apparel, it\u2019s a pretty big part of the story here in terms of the discretionary recovery, can you talk more about areas in apparel or price points or how you would characterize this recovery in terms of it being part of your strategic initiative, maybe a little bit more detail around home in that same context. And then in terms of the comps that you talked about for the fourth quarter, I guess negative low single-digits, I think describing as being maybe more likely or a more responsible view at this point, any flow by month through the quarter and also any sensitivity you\u2019d be willing to share with us if in fact you did start to see it go more toward a more positive low single.", "Kathryn Tesija ", "So starting out with apparel, I think our strength is predominantly in our core and must haves and I think that would apply to home as well. And while we still have a healthy business on the fashion side, most of our improvements that came in the third quarter really came in the core and the must have side and as mentioned earlier, a lot of that was in the seasonal businesses.", "So as the weather turns the guests clearly was updating her wardrobe to accommodate that. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "On the same store sales question, as you know we\u2019ve already provided guidance for November to be essentially flat to last year and Gregg commented that we\u2019re starting out a bit softer then the pace that we would have hoped, but of course a huge portion of November is yet to come because of the concentration of sales around Thanksgiving. ", "In light of thinking about a quarter that might be a down slightly, down somewhat obviously December cannot be very different from that quarterly outcome if November turns out to be flat give or take. So I don\u2019t expect anything remarkably different about December then what we end up reporting for the entire quarter. ", "And in terms of sensitivity a point of sales in our fourth quarter of course is a very large number because of seasonality. Certainly something approaching $200 million and the flow through on that could be quite substantial especially if its concentrated in seasonal or higher margin items that otherwise might have been marked down. ", "Those categories remember are categories in which we already have a real good handle on our unit sales. The question is what will the mix be of regular price, promotional price, and clearance sales. There is some extra expense associated with those sales so I don\u2019t need to make it sound as if all of that would flow through to the bottom line. ", "But of course as in every fourth quarter our bottom line is very sensitive to what happens in those seasonally important categories. ", "Jeff Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "One other thing on your marketing expenses, you talked about building that in the third quarter, your SG&A came in better, or more favorably, have there been any changes in your, the strategic initiatives along the lines of marketing dollars. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Certainly we have maintained the ability to keep the pace in the fourth quarter in the marketing wars and therefore on a proportional basis or a seasonal basis, we\u2019ll spend a little more in Q4 this year as compared to a little less that we have spent so far this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller - William Blair ", "Mark Miller - William Blair ", "I was hoping you could elaborate on your comments that you have expectations for a highly promotional holiday season, does that represent a change from what I think you\u2019ve described as a rational competitive environment, are you seeing different competitive behavior thus far in the fourth quarter.", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "The way I would describe is we typically expect a highly promotional fourth quarter. The last number of years have been highly promotional and we don\u2019t believe that this year will be any different. We\u2019re not expecting it to be any more promotional then prior years but as you know when you get around Thanksgiving and early in December it gets very price oriented and there\u2019s a lot of door buster activity and limited time only sales. ", "And we just expect that kind of activity to be there this year like it was last year. We\u2019re hopeful that it will be, that while it might be more promotional in nature from a marketing standpoint we believe that most retailers have done a better job of managing their inventory levels and we think that overall inventory within stores in the pipeline are going to be better synchronized compared to last year so there may not be as much intensity around the clearance side of the business or the marketing to clearance and those kinds of events that had to liquidate all the excess inventory that existed last year. ", "So they\u2019ll probably be aggressive nature as it relates to be proactive in nature but hopefully there\u2019ll be less activity as it relates to having to get rid of merchandise because retailers over bought. I think most retailers have come into the fourth quarter in a relatively good inventory position. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair ", "So my impression the last time we spoke was that you described things I think as rational, you had good markup and I guess my takeaway is it might have even been a little bit, slightly more favorable then normal, can you comment on that and current trends, would you say its average or is it similar to what we had seen during the summer. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I think you\u2019re putting too fine a micrometer on these comments. The environment has been rational. The environment remains rational. It\u2019s the fourth quarter. We expect a highly promotional fourth quarter. We always expect a highly promotional fourth quarter. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair ", "And then looking ahead, Wal-Mart has been talking about the productivity loop coming back, I think its perceived to be more of a forward comment as their expenses come down, but would you offer any comment about how you think that might impact or not impact Target. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Well we\u2019ve experienced the same productivity loop. I think both of us have managed our expenses and driven up productivity. Their gross margin rates are up as well so they\u2019re not reinvesting in only low prices. They are to some extent reinvesting in more aggressive pricing, but some of that is dropping to the bottom line. ", "So as long as that kind of environment maintains itself we should be able to do both, support the productivity loop and hopefully preserve the levels of profitability that we have, or if we see some rebound on the discretionary side of the business or continued rebound, we\u2019ll be able to see some slight margin expansion. ", "But we\u2019re not counting on it at this time. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "What do you think has driven the pickup in traffic in recent months. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "I think overall consumers are more confident. I think that their confidence level is more about the future then perhaps it is right now, but I think like any adjustment that they go through, they have a tendency to hold back and not go into stores and I think that they\u2019ve adjusted their budgets. They see more stability in the environment, unemployment rates, they\u2019re at high levels but I don\u2019t think anybody is really expecting them to get worse, only better over time.", "So I think the consumer is in a better place and more confident. So I think they\u2019re back to more normalized patterns so we\u2019re getting some of those trips back that we have lost when times were more difficult but on the other hand, you\u2019re seeing the consumer being more disciplined and that\u2019s why there is fewer items in the basket or they\u2019re buying private brand instead of the national brands. ", "So while they\u2019re back to their typical shopping patterns in terms of frequency of visits, they\u2019re more disciplined in their spending habits. They\u2019re coming in with lists and circulars. They\u2019re focused on items that are on sale, they\u2019re coming in with coupons, and rebates and things that can lower the price. ", "So they\u2019re still very, very cautious in what they\u2019re spending but their basic routines are more normalized is the way I would describe it. ", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "You had also gone through a lot of let\u2019s say new initiatives, and there\u2019s also the low price promise, how important to you think those initiatives being fully rolled out and communicated to customers are also having an impact on traffic. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "I think its very important, its reassurance that our pricing is very competitive in the marketplace and that\u2019s how we\u2019re communicating that whether that\u2019s in store with bold signings, or within the circular, having fewer items, that\u2019s larger pictures, bigger price points, easier for her to see and sort through. ", "I think all of those things contribute to traffic to Target getting on her grocery list or her discretionary list every single week and I think it\u2019s a reassurance that Target can offer the great assortment as well as have great pricing. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "I would just add that we continue to profitably gain market share by doing everything we need to do well. We\u2019ve got to have the right content, we\u2019ve got to be in stock, we\u2019ve got to communicate these values in inspiring and compelling ways. We\u2019ve got to deliver a superior in-store experience which means highly engaged team members that are available on the floor, that are knowledgeable and then ultimately providing the right kind of low wait times at our registers, whether its in electronics or at the front end. ", "We\u2019ve got to get people in and out because they appreciate that and we are focused on improving all aspects of that and I think what you\u2019re seeing is Target operating well in all of those dimensions. The pipeline innovation that Kathryn talked about is very, very high. We\u2019re in the process of rolling out P-Fresh but there are a lot of other merchandising initiatives that we have in either a test or pilot phase that we\u2019ll continue to share with you as time goes on, that we think we\u2019re going to continue to make our shopping experience even better then it is today and we believe that the guests will understand it and appreciate it and we\u2019ll gain market share as a result of the innovations that we\u2019re going to be layering in the store over the next couple of years. ", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "One of the other initiatives I actually wanted to talk about was in jewelry with the reset there, can you talk about how that came about and if we look out where you are now versus where you were a year ago in jewelry, maybe just some of the early wins and how that came about. ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "We set out to make the environment much more guest friendly. As you know in the past we had locked up most of our jewelry under glass and so guests could view it but they needed assistance to be able to get it out of the case and try it on. And so we did a pilot for a period of time and have now expanded that to all stores.", "But really bringing all the product out from under that glass, up on the top of those cases and in new stores on tables, so guests can try on the product, touch and feel it, see how it looks. So that\u2019s been a big win in terms of accessibility. ", "The second piece of that is really changing the assortment, bringing down the price point so everything is under $50.00, which our guests have responded to incredibly well. ", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "And then just on P-Fresh, how should, based on the success of the Philly rollout, should we think about those 350 new stores, new stores or the P-Fresh rollouts in 2010 as being in markets like Philly or more as kind of one-offs. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "We\u2019re going to start with our high priority markets and we\u2019re going to be doing the majority of stores in those markets but we won\u2019t be able to complete all stores within a given market. Over time we will come back to those markets in 2011 and 2012 but sheer volume and capacity and the ability to manage the levels of complexity don\u2019t allow us to get 100% coverage in each of those markets. ", "But over time we really expect to get through the majority of the chain. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets ", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets ", "Back to the P-Fresh format can you just give us some idea about what your current thinking is that from, what kind of sustained sales lift do you need to cover your cost of capital when you look at a $20 million store that you would convert versus a $40 million store and do you feel comfortable about the smaller volume stores now and being able to roll that back, and get the P-Fresh format back into those smaller stores.", "Douglas Scovanner ", "We\u2019re not yet at that stage. There are a lot of questions that we are in the process of answering that its premature to decide but all else being equal of course, we need a much bigger percentage lift in your smaller store then your larger store if we spend the same amount of capital on which we\u2019re trying to earn a return. ", "The dollars of the lift in concept need to be the same and that represents a much higher percentage in the smaller store. The other really important open question is whether we\u2019ll enjoy a year two lift in these stores over and above the base line. Separately it\u2019s a bit premature to decide how much of the lift will occur outside the food and cross over related to food categories.", "That\u2019s after all what we\u2019re trying to learn here that inform our thinking as we move forward beyond 2010 with this program. ", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets ", "And my second question was can you talk a little bit about your expectations at least preliminarily about 2010 for balance growth in the credit operation or contraction and related to that do you get a sense that the appetite for the size portfolio that you have is more or less better or worse then it would have been say three or four months ago. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Its not a question of appetite, its far more a question of environment and the environment includes our view of the risks and it also includes the realities of the hugely anti-stimulative credit card tax which will have the direct impact of shrinking our portfolio and shrinking portfolios of virtually everyone else in the industry. ", "So as we look into 2010 I think you\u2019re very likely to see continued declines in the size of our portfolio, continued declines from an industry standpoint in the portfolios of others as well. ", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets ", "Would you care to put any numbers around that, like high single-digit or is it too early to say. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Well the pace that we\u2019re on right now, as I mentioned earlier, is to be down year over year about a billion dollars at year-end. That\u2019s a low double-digit percentage year over year and as a working point that currently by definition is our current pace of decline. ", "In essence charge activity has fallen off at a much faster pace then has payment activity and that is a set of dynamics that are very likely to continue into 2010. Whether it continues at a high single-digit percentage or a low double-digit percentage is an open question, but its highly likely that our portfolio will continue to shrink in gross accounts receivable terms. ", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets ", "And my final question, if you could just discuss with us the sustainability of the gross margin improvements that you\u2019ve made so far as you look broadly across all of those classes and does it continue into 2010 particularly in the back half of 2010 and how you balance the impact of P-Fresh on mix.", "Kathryn Tesija ", "For gross margin you know we have a lot of initiatives to help drive our gross margin and we have grown it in many categories across the board to help offset some of the mix impact that we\u2019ve experienced. So our intent is that we will continue to do that. Some of those initiatives are making sure that we\u2019re growing our own brand portfolio which is more profitable. ", "Very good inventory control, which has helped us throughout 2009. We\u2019ve done a lot of segmentation both in volume, high and low volume but as well as assortment optimization, which has helped us improve markdown rates in some of those stores. ", "And lastly really optimizing our SKU count so we\u2019re down about 5% this year in our SKUs which has helped our stores to be more productive as well as reduced markdowns. So we will continue on all of those fronts throughout 2010 to make sure that we\u2019re able to offset the headwinds from the mix. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Two questions, first on the bad debt expense, I was just curious what drove the decision to take the bad debt expense in excess of the net write-offs given some of the improvements we\u2019ve been seeing in the credit metrics and then secondly with regard to store expansion next year, at this point is the store openings pretty firm based on your prior guidance or is there still some chance that there could be some upside if [this] continues to improve. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "No, 2010 store opening program is essentially also baked. We\u2019re working on 2011 and 2012. We can\u2019t construct stores fast enough to start thinking about building a store that would open in 2010 right now and actually make it so. ", "On the bad debt expense question, as you know we take a very careful look at the end of every quarter to determine what our allowance for doubtful accounts should be and that indirectly determines of course bad debt expense for the quarter for the period just ended. ", "In the most recent analysis I would observe that the slight uptick that we expect in net write-offs in the fourth quarter in sequence when compared to the third quarter is largely attributable to the impact of our May 2009 terms changes. When we changed terms that of course has a net beneficial impact but focusing on this line only, causes a subset of the effected guests to go to write-offs who otherwise would not have gone to write-offs.", "So six months of no activity of course yields an aged write-off and so the fourth quarter will represent the peak of aged write-offs directly traceable to the May 2009 terms change. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "Two questions, first on the credit piece of it, with the Master Trust data that was out today, the early stage delinquencies I believe started to have sequentially deteriorated so can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019ve incorporated that into your prior write-off expectation and the one you talked around $300 million. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "Well again we\u2019re talking about the same issue. We have seen some sequential deterioration since May and virtually all of it is directly attributable to the May 2009 terms change. So all of that is incorporated in our thinking and incorporated not simply in comments I\u2019ve made about bad debt expense and write-offs and balance sheet, but from my standpoint more importantly incorporated in our thinking about our highly likely ability to continue to maintain modest and appropriate levels of profitability moving forward.", "We continue to enjoy a very strong performance in 46 states and continue to suffer from lingering nasty losses, in California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida. ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital ", "And then on the expectations for the SG&A mid single-digit increase for the fourth quarter, how much of that increase is purely a function of higher staffing levels and can you put any numbers on how your staffing numbers were down last year during the fourth quarter. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I wouldn\u2019t think of it as higher staffing levels, but rather the way that we have enjoyed the big SG&A benefit so far this year, is by enjoying terrific gains in productivity. So sharp increases in dollar sales per hour worked, per hours worked in our stores. ", "If you turn the clock back to the fourth quarter of last year, we enjoyed a much bigger year over year performance benefit, a much bigger gain in productivity then we had even wanted to achieve. And so if you think of this as kind of a two year analysis the way that a lot of you analyze same store sales performance, our two year performance in the fourth quarter will look very similar to our two year performance in other quarters, but year over year it means that we won\u2019t enjoy a meaningful productivity gain in Q4 this year. ", "And in light of the likelihood of negative same store sales performance and in context of increases in wages per hour and increases in benefits per hour, that produces and upside down equation for the quarter only. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research ", "John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research ", "Just a question on the comp guidance and planning for the fourth quarter, you indicated that you thought it would be, it is possible to achieve positive comps in the fourth quarter and I assume that you believe that even with the context of the slightly softer start to November. So could you just elaborate a little bit on what you think might drive those positive comps and then secondly, I assume that your comment on the streets fourth quarter EPS figure incorporates the current sales trend. That is you\u2019re comfortable with the current street number in the language that you used, even with the current slightly softer trend in November. Is that accurate. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "The reason we have put a range around the fourth quarter is because we\u2019re up against substantially weaker comps of a year ago so as we\u2019ve watched our business strengthen from second quarter throughout the third quarter we\u2019re now cycling more problematic sales environment of last year. ", "So with that in mind if there is some resilience to the consumer this year, it could be plus or minus so we\u2019re optimistic that it could be better then what our planning assumptions are, but it might not be that way either. ", "Early November is a little softer, as Douglas talked about, we think that was more primarily related to warmer weather patterns throughout the United States but so much of this fourth quarter is going to be decided in two days after Thanksgiving and the four weeks prior to Christmas and nobody really knows at this point in time how good its going to be. ", "So it\u2019s a wide range of estimates and right now we\u2019re expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of flat given everything that we see right now. But if there\u2019s more business to be had, clearly we have the inventory to do mid or low single-digit comp increases in December. ", "Douglas Scovanner ", "I think its important to clarify my comments, or to repeat my comments on earnings earlier, I did not say that I was comfortable with $1.12. I didn\u2019t say I was uncomfortable with it either. What I said was that I believe that figure was within a range of potential outcomes and I said that I believe that many things would have to fall in place to achieve it.

Welcome to the Target Corporation's fourth quarter and year-end earnings release conference call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards you will be invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded Tuesday February 23, 2010. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thank you and good morning and welcome to our 2009 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising. This morning I will provide a high level overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results along with our priorities as we enter 2010. Then Kathy will discuss category results, share recent insight in to how our guests are thinking and behaving in this environment and outline initiatives to drive our business forward in 2010. And finally Doug will provide detail on our 2009 financial results and 2010 performance outlook. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. ", "As a reminder we're joined on this call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via web cast. Following this conference call John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "We are very pleased with the fourth quarter financial results we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter's earnings per share of $1.24 are well above the expectations we had going into the quarter and these very strong results clearly demonstrates the resilience of our strategy, the effectiveness of our operating model and the power of continued strong execution by our team.", "Our fourth quarter marketing and merchandising programs generated better than expected sales growth, particularly in the holiday season which combined with continued disciplined inventory management to deliver outstanding gross margin and profit performance. We also continued to deliver strong productivity in our stores and expense control across the company. When combined, the strength of these fourth quarter results contributed to the highest 2009 full-year retail segment EBIT in our history even with a 2.5% decline in comparable store sales for the year and our credit card portfolio generated solid profits and return on investment for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, a notable achievement in light of the challenges faced by many other credit card issuers in 2009.", "A year ago, we outlined the decisive actions we were taking to manage our business responsibly or staying true to our brand in a very uncertain and challenging environment. I am pleased that we were able to accomplish both of these objectives in 2009 and as a result we are entering 2010 in a very strong, strategic and financial position.", "In a year of unprecedented challenges, we turbocharged our commitment to innovation, positioning our business for the long term and ensuring our continued relevance with consumers. We completely reinvented our marketing approach and initiated more merchandising innovation in a single year than I have seen in any of my 30 years with the company. We described a number of these innovations during our January meeting with many of you at Philadelphia and Kathy will share some additional initiatives today.", "We believe that collectively this set of innovations will be a powerful catalyst for future market share growth. In 2009, we set out to remove price as a perceived barrier to shopping at Target and surveys indicate that we have made meaningful progress. Regardless of the economic environment going forward, we will continue to address the gap between the perception and the reality of our pricing while maintaining our focus on fashion, design and a superior store experience that combined to make target a unique and valued shopping destination.", "As we assess the state of both the economy and our business, it's clear that things have meaningfully improved from a year ago. While economic conditions are far from being back to the normal of 2006 and 2007, employment appears to have stabilized, consumer confidence has recovered and credit markets are no longer frozen. And our fourth quarter results show that we are on our game and that we can generate great results in this economy. Compared to a year ago, our sales trends are much stronger and volatility is much lower giving us greater confidence in our outlook for 2010 sales and profitability.", "We expect economic recovery to continue in 2010, but we expect progress to remain slow as consumers face historically high rates of unemployment and lack of access to consumer credit particularly in light of anticipated effects of the Card Act. Against the backdrop of the external environment, we are confident that Target is in a very strong position. Our broad assortment of need-based food and commodity items helped us weather the downturn and as the economy recovers our unique combination of high-quality, affordably-priced home and apparel merchandise is perfectly aligned with today's more frugal consumer mindset. We have a world-class brand, a strong pipeline of merchandising innovation and we implemented expense discipline that will maintain going forward even when the economy has fully recovered. With this unique combination of discipline and innovation we believe we will continue to profitably gain market share from a variety of competitors in 2010.", "As we contemplate growth in our stores, we've identified four distinct opportunities. In the near term, we are focusing on refreshing our existing store base by incorporating merchandising reinventions across the sales floor including food, home, beauty and electronics and getting high return general merchandise on SuperTarget locations in trade areas across the United States.", "In the longer term, we see potential opportunities to develop a smaller footprint that would allow us to operate in dense urban markets where our brand is strong, but where real estate availability prevents us from opening larger stores and expanding us beyond United States potentially in the Canada, Mexico, or Latin America in a timeframe that is likely 3 to 5 years out or even longer.", "As we previously announced, our primary focus in 2010 is to remodel about 340 stores, far more than in past years. We expect to complete just under 100 of these remodels in the first quarter with the remaining remodels spread roughly equally across the second and third quarters. In addition, we expect to open 30 new stores in 2010 adding about 10 new locations net of closings in relocations. These stores will open in the July and October cycles with no new stores plan for our March cycle this year.", "We also continue to invest in online and mobile tools to improve the guest experience and drive sales across channels by creating an anywhere-anytime shopping experience for Target guests. As we explore opportunities to invest in our business, we apply the same financial discipline and returns-based approach we have taken in the past. Our prudent management of capital in the environment of the last 18 months provides ample evidence that we do not invest mechanically in growth for it own sake, but only when we identify a clear opportunity to strengthen our business, capture market share profitably and create long-term value for our shareholders.", "Going forward, we will invest without hesitation in initiatives we believe are appropriate from a strategic and financial standpoint. Our ability to balance discipline and innovation is part of our DNA. It allowed us to achieve great financial results in 2009 while positioning us for a stronger 2010. We are confident that if we focus on our guests and stay true to our brand, we will continue to drive meaningful value for our shareholders over time.", "Now Kathy will provide additional color on our guest insights research and additional detail on our merchandizing and marketing initiatives. Kathy?", "Kathy Tesija", "Thanks Gregg. From the beginning of the economic downturn, we were determined to exceed our guest-evolving expectations while remaining firmly committed to our expect more and pay less brand promise. I believe our fourth quarter sales and traffic trends validate that we have achieved both of these objectives by delivering on a strategy that continues to resonate with our guests.", "In addition these results indicate that consumers are beginning to show signs of cautious optimism. Guest traffic continue to improve in the fourth quarter, up about 2% compared to 2008. Our improving traffic trend is very encouraging confirming what our guest research has indicated over the last 18 months. As the recession began, guest told us that they were still as loyal to Target as ever, but they were cutting back on discretionary shopping trips and focusing more exclusively on needs based trips.", "Today, guests are telling us that they are increasingly confident and are visiting more often and shopping more at the store. Once hesitant and even fearful, they now are taking pride in their new found financial discipline and their confidence is leading them to add a few more home and apparel items to their basket. This subtle change in guest behavior has significantly narrowed the sales gap between our discretionary and non-discretionary businesses. In fact, the impact of sales mix on fourth quarter gross margin was a very slight six basis points of headwind, much smaller than we've seen over time and less than we expect over the longer-term. ", "We're particularly pleased with our performance over the holiday season which reflects our efforts to better align our marketing and merchandizing strategies to drive the business. We surprised our guests with new and enticing merchandize, provided a superior shopping environment and punctuated the experience with fresh marketing. Our breakthrough holiday marketing campaigns in print, TV and online engaged our guests and drove a sense of urgency generating a mid-single digit comp for our two day sale. Our redesigned circular clearly resonated with guests as we saw strong double digit comps for featured items and Target.com's Thanksgiving Day online only sale generated considerable site traffic and more than a 60% sales increase over 2008. ", "Beyond the holiday season, our Merona line continues to lead in women's apparel with guests drawn to great quality, price and design in core and must have items. In home, we are seeing improvement in numerous businesses with particular strength in core basic categories and the relaunch of Room Essentials is off to a great start. In addition, some of our best lines, including the new Giada De Laurentiis Kitchen collection and our reinvented and newly acquired Smith & Hawken line are off to very strong starts. ", "We're also pleased with the results from The Great Save, our warehouse club style event that replaced last year's Home Design event. The guest response has been extremely positive. Sales for the event were in line with our expectations and much stronger than for the Home Design event last year. We continue to manage inventories conservatively while ensuring that we remain reliably in stock on the commodity items our guests need everyday. ", "Disciplined inventory control was a key factor in our strong fourth quarter gross margin and profitability. In 2010, we'll continue to experience -- to exercise discipline in our buying decisions while creating contingency plans that will allow us to chase stronger than expected sales trends in our discretionary categories when they emerge. It's important to note that while the overall sales environment in 2009 was quite challenging, Target gained market share across the store and we have plans in place to accelerate that trend in 2010. ", "As Greg already mentioned, we've driven unprecedented innovation in merchandising over the last year and we'll see the results of that innovation throughout 2010. In particular, we're excited about the transformational changes you will see in about 350 new and remodeled Target stores, innovations we covered in depth at last month's financial community meeting. Much of the discussion at that meeting was about the PFresh food layout and its ability to win at the fill-in grocery trip within our general merchandise format, driving trips and sales. But we're equally excited about innovations throughout the store including beauty where we are creating an environment that's easier for guests to shop, provides opportunities to discover and test the latest products and incorporates lighting and fixtures usually found at upscale beauty retailers. ", "Home, where we're making our own brands even more appealing and intuitive to shop by clarifying the assortment, better defining and aligning each style with guest segments and where we're improving the shopping environment by creating a more open and visually compelling department that features dominant worlds, inspirational signage and more opportunities to actually touch and feel the product. ", "Video games, where we're creating a one of a kind experience that is more open, intuitive and informative with games positioned on tethers to provide easy access to game information on the back of the package. ", "Electronics, where we're providing our guests with added convenience through a variety of initiatives look TV delivery, installation, set up and recycling; and BullsEye Mobile Solutions of full service cell phone program that's currently in about 100 stores now and set to expand to 800 stores by October. And shoes, where we're providing a more engaging shopping experience with improved sightlines, better in-stock visibility and greater convenience accompanied by a simplified operational process that enhances both in stocks and store productivity.", "As you know, our own brands drive sales, guest loyalty and generates strong growth margins. We continue to focus on strengthening our own brand portfolio and in 2009 we saw great results for Circo in Kids, Merona in women's apparel and up & up in commodities. In 2010 we'll continue to leverage our most powerful brands to tell a more cohesive story and deliver clear and compelling value for our guests. ", "In support of the expect more side of our brand promise in 2010, we have a roster of designer partnerships that is second to none. This spring we've announced a comprehensive new cookware and food line from Giada De Laurentiis, exciting limited edition collections from fashion icons Jean Paul Gaultier and Zac Posen, vibrant spring floral prints from Liberty of London and limited time only accessory collections from contemporary design stars Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Of course because our guest don't just experience the target brand in our stores, we need to make sure that we are driving the best aspects of the brand across all environments and channels so its clear what we stand for at every touch point. On multi-media approach to communicating with our guest is aimed at connecting with her during all of her discovery, exploration, research and purchase moments. ", "We'll continue to position Target as the go to resource for many things in her life while evolving to deliver what she thought the element of surprise in newly relevant ways. Like our guests, we're proud to have weathered the storm, having delivered one of our most profitable years on record. We did this without compromising in our brands, our culture, our quality or the guest experience. We're excited about innovations in store for 2010 and confident that we're in an excellent position to continue to gain market share profitably. If the last year has thought us anything, it's that our ability to be in tune with the guest, nimble in our approach and still disciplined in our execution will serve us well beyond 2009.", "Now, Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for 2010. Doug.", "Doug Scovanner", "", "Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, paying particular attention to trends within the year. Then I'll provide a view of our 2010 outlook for both business segments and earnings per share. As you heard from Greg, our fourth quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, primarily due to stronger than expected results in our retail segment and secondarily due to favorability in our income tax provision.", "Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.24 represented increase of more than 50% compared to last year and our full year 2009 EPS of $3.30 is only 1% below the all-time high that we posted in 2007. This is truly remarkable profit performance in light of the economic challenges and top line pressure we faced over the last two years. Specifically, our comparable store sales in 2009 compounded to a level about 5 percentage points below our 2007 results and comparable store sales in our discretionary categories have declined even more.", "The combined impact of these factors have the potential to genuinely corrode our profits and returns, but in EPS terms we were able to offset all but 1% of that pressure through a combination of gross margin rate improvement within categories, thoughtful expense control and prudent investment decisions.", "Fourth quarter sales exceeded our baseline expectations and we're particularly strong during the holiday season. As a result we ended December with a very little clearance inventory leading to a sharp decline in January clearance sales compared to a year ago. In other words within the quarter, we substituted higher sales of full price merchandise for lower sales of much less profitable clearance inventory particularly in January. This form of sales mix experience combined with the unusually small gross margin rate impact from the more traditional view of sales mix that Kathy described earlier drove strong performance in the quarter.", "In summary, on a sales gain of just under $700 million, our gross margin improved by more than $500 million. Retail SG&A expenses were inline with our expectations for the quarter. Store productivity remains strong yet as expected it improved only slightly over last year due to unusually strong store productivity gains we enjoyed in fourth quarter 2008.", "Also notable in the fourth quarter was the beneficial impact of the previously disclosed Visa/MasterCard settlement and the adverse impact of higher than expected incentive compensation resulting from our equally higher than expected fourth quarter financial performance.", "Fourth quarter credit card segment performance was inline with our expectations. Net write-offs were $293 million, a little more than our bad debt expense. Gross receivables ended the year at just under $8 billion, representing a reduction of $1.1 billion compared to a year ago.", "On average, during the year, we reduced Target's investment in the portfolio by about 32% or $1.3 billion. Against this sharply lower base of invested capital our credit card segment profit generated a 30% increase in its pre-tax profit. These two trends combined to produce a near doubling of credit card segment pre-tax ROIC for the year.", "Now lets turn to our balance sheet and our capital structure. During this call last year we said that we expected to generate cash flow from operations in excess of $4 billion in 2009 and I expressed the opinion that this would likely be sufficient to fund our capital investments and dividends and payoff our $1.3 billion of maturing debt all through internally generated funds.", "Our actual results for the year reflect a generation of just under $6 billion in cash flow from operations beating our previous record by more than $1 billion. This cash flow result was driven primarily by beating the 2009 first call EPS estimate of $2.38 in place a year ago by $0.92 per share.", "Ultimately this robust cash flow allowed us to achieve all of our original treasury objectives and in addition, it allowed us to fund the early payoff of a $550 million 2010 debt maturity to restart our share repurchase program much earlier then anticipated and to enjoy a $1.3 billion increase in marketable securities at year end.", "Now lets turn our attention to our earnings prospects in 2010, I'll do that by reviewing each segment and then touching on a couple of important consolidation matters. In the retail segment we expect to generate increases in comparable store sales, perhaps in a range of 2% to 4% for the year, including an expected one percentage point lift from our remodel program.", "And while our comparisons are easier in the spring then the fall, the remodel impact will grow as the year progresses. We just achieved a 10% EBITDA margin rate in this segment in 2009, nearly a record high performance, driven by actual record high gross margin rate performance.", "To me this means that our recipe to grow retail segment EBIT in 2010 and beyond will more likely result from our ability to grow sales while generally preserving our healthy operating margins, than from trying engineer increases in operating margins from our current levels. In other words in 2010, we expect to be able to grow retail segment EBIT by a mid single digit percentage, in line with our total sales growth while generally preserving our strong EBIT margin rate experience of 2009.", "To provide some color on prospects by quarter, we first look at the pattern in 2009 of generally non recurring matters such as benefits from the Visa/MasterCard settlement and from adjustments to our workers compensation accruals. We then look at the year-over-year patterns by quarter of things like incentive compensation, marketing expense and depreciation and start up expense for our new stores and remodel activity.", "In 2010 the net of all of this will be a modest year-over-year headwind in each of the first two quarters and a modest tailwind in each of the third and fourth quarters. For example, in the first quarter the impact of these issues will be between $0.03 and $0.04 per share with the previously disclosed accelerated depreciation representing the largest driver.", "In our credit card segment, we're entering the year with strong momentum yet what may be the most adverse impact of the anti simulative card act will not hit until the fall. At that time we'll be subject to regulations that will establish limits on late fees but as of today we're waiting on the Fed to define those limits.", "Overall we expect to be able to produce yet another year of improving ROIC in this segment, although segment profit may be flattish for the year considering the likelihood of continued low double digit percentage reductions in receivables.", "As we've previously discussed we continue to test two separate ideas which could shape the future of this business segment. In one test we're exploring the idea of returning to issuing cards solely for use in our stores. In another we're testing a totally different reward structure in two markets offering guests who use our card in Kansas City for example 5% off on every item, every transaction, everyday. We expect to have more to say about each of these two tests as the year progresses.", "Beyond our two segments I'll touch on two other key factors affecting earnings and EPS. We expect our 2010 book effective tax rate to approximate our long term structural rate, perhaps in a range of 37% to 37.5%. Please remember that about $0.07 of 2009 EPS resulted from fourth quarter discreet matters that temporarily grow this rate well below this range.", "Separately we expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization not just because we can easily afford to do so but rather and most importantly because we believe it will prove to be a great investment of shareholder capital overtime.", "We expect our 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, reflective of projects we'll complete in 2010 as well as initial spending for 2011 and 2012 new store programs. Our preliminary expectation is that our 2011 new store program will be in the range of 20 to 30 stores and lead times will require us to firm up that number over the next six to nine months. We would love to invest more aggressively in these stores but we this is likely all the projects that will make sense to pursue in this environment.", "Due to the early repayment of the August 2010 debt maturity, the only significant remaining 2010 maturity prior to our seasonal peak is the $900 million public series collateralized by our credit card receivables which are due in October.", "We don't intend to continue to de-leverage our consolidated balance sheet further. So its likely that we would elect to refinance this amount at some point. We continue to enjoy very efficient access to the debt capital markets in light of our strategy, our balance sheet and our strong investment grade credit ratings.", "And as our custom, I'll close with some specific comments on EPS guidance. I feel very good about our momentum and prospects as we enter 2010 with two healthy business segments and an overall balance sheet and cash flow pictures that remains very strong.", "The current first call medium EPS estimate for the $3.62 and while the outlook we have laid out today would produce results somewhat lower than $3.62 per share, this figure is clearly within a potential range of achievability. Similarly the first current first call medium EPS estimate for the first quarter is $0.76 which would represent out about a 100% increase from last year's result of $0.69.", "Even with out current strong momentum, this growth expectation feels somewhat stronger than a middle of the road outlook especially in light of the $0.03 to $0.04 headwind in the quarter, I discussed earlier. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Our 2009 performance demonstrates our ability to effectively manage our business in the near term while positioning ourselves for the longer term. As we enter 2010, we are seeing positive momentum across our business segments and we'll build on that momentum by introducing newness and innovation throughout the year.", "We're confident that we have the right plans in place and the right team to implement them. While the pace of the current economic recovery will continue to affect consumer spending behavior, we're optimistic about our ability to manage effectively regardless of the economic environment, and to continue to create meaningful shareholder value overtime. That concludes our prepared remarks. Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "So Gregg, if you could talk a little bit about the inventory planning. It seems as if Kathy had mentioned about, it seems some cautious optimism as it relates to discretionary categories. Could you help us think about how you're planning those discretionary categories as it relates to inventory as you've done such a good job?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We believe that we've clearly passed that environment where there is more downside than upside and we're more in, there's more upside than downside. So we plan our inventories in line with sales. We think that there are currently slightly more upside in our planning assumptions than originally thought and we are chasing some businesses because our sales currently are exceeding prior expectations, but overall we are in good shape. We are in line and we are going to continue to plan the discretionary categories conservatively yet appropriately which means slightly more aggressive than last year.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Okay looks as if the inventory is up about 7% overall, maybe give us a sense on the square footage basis how you ended.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, it's just up slightly over last year, but it's down prior to 2007 year, so we are right in the middle and if you just look at a one-year comparison we probably ended last year a little bit too late and we were in a recovery mode far too long last year. We really didn't fully recover in our stores until about the March timeframe and we really set about this year to do a much better job of making sure that we are back in business and ready to go much earlier and that's really the result what you are seeing is that 7% increase over last year which we think is very appropriate and very targeted to the specific categories that we want to increase.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Doug if I could ask you as related to the reserve drawdown, it seems that we've now seen the second consecutive quarter, could you help us think about what a reasonable set of expectations are for continued opportunities to drawdown the reserve heading into 2010?", "Doug Scovanner", "We don't think of it in the sense of a drawdown because the reserve has been established to cover the write-off potential of our existing portfolio. I think the question is at what replacement rate will our activity moving forward create bad debt expense, so it isn't really a drawdown that is the net of two very different activities. The reserve is appropriately sized for the risks we have today. Separately the portfolio continues to decline at a double-digit percentage year-over-year and therefore the bad debt expense moving forward will certainly have a component of reduction due to the fact that the portfolio shrinking, separately I think that the risks in the replacement receivables we're putting on the books are likely much lower. So net-net, yes that does mean that the reserve is very likely to be reduced during the year and will stay in touch quarter-by-quarter in terms of the outlook. First quarter, feel very, very good about the momentum in our credit card operations.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Great, and then last if I could just ask on the PFresh you shared with us at the analyst meeting and we understand it's early days but any update in terms of change of a trip behavior, it sounds if you are seeing some cautious optimism in discretionary categories, are you seeing PFresh an improvement in the crossover it hadn't seemed as if we had seen yet and are you starting to see some improvement on the margin there?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well we're not seeing a meaningful change from what we shared with you when we are in Philadelphia. We are seeing strength across the board in discretionary categories and to what extent it's due to PFresh versus not PFresh, we're just excited to see that the consumer has more discretionary income and like we said in Philadelphia we believe that overtime our ability to crossell to those guests that are coming in for food and other necessities will improve and we'll develop the right kinds of surgical marketing programs that guest conversion in other parts of store whether it's a apparel or home.", "Doug Scovanner", "Our outlook for PFresh is unchanged from what we laid out in detail in Philadelphia four or five weeks ago.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "", "Kathy you'll be happy to know based on our conversation after the PFresh meeting that I wanted to see all the aspects or invention, so I did go to Medina to see home, beauty, video games, TVs, thermos [ph], electric, how many of those stores will look like that by the end of 2010 because I was definitely very impressed.", "Kathy Tesija", "So, we have about 350 stores between remodels and new stores this year and so those innovations will be in most of those stores throughout the year. There are some variations where we have gone back into Medina and done some upgrades and we'll come back and address that at a later time, but the ones you mentioned home, beauty, video games will all be in the stores, shoes which you saw in Medina, we will start putting in stores in July.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "What was the penetration rate of Target cards in your stores this quarter?", "Doug Scovanner", "It was certainly in the range of 5% or 6%; we'll come back with a precise figure.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Okay and then I know you said that you would come back to us in terms of an update with regards to what your seeing in KC and San Antonio, but are you seeing a higher penetration rate in those stores?", "Doug Scovanner", "Sharply higher penetration especially in Kansas City, the 5% market sharply higher, sharply higher credit quality of the guests asking for cards, sharply higher pace of guests asking for the cards. The whole question in Kansas City is whether all of those benefits are sufficient to pull it forward [ph] the incremental markdowns associated with a 5% program on every transaction, every item every day.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Can you update us on inflation expectations, whether it's general merchandise or food and then also what percent of product is currently directly sourced and what's the additional opportunity as we think about gross margins for 2010?", "Doug Scovanner", "Obviously the US economy has been through quite a rollercoaster as it relates to inflation especially in food products certainly in 2008 with inflation rates so high, retailers with a much higher penetration of foods on our own enjoyed a very strong benefit to their topline in contrast of food as measured by the federal government is in a significant deflationary mode has been for the last two quarters and retailers with a very high penetration of food certainly have toplines that are under a lot more pressure than our own as a direct result of this deflationary factor.", "Who knows where that's going to go 2011, 2012 but at the moment the year-over-year trends in food are clearly deflationary.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Our direct import percent has reached a high watermark of about 30% at the end of 2007 because of the high penetration in discretionary categories as those businesses contracted in 2008 and 2009. We saw some reduction in that overall direct import percentage. So we finished last year somewhere in the neighborhood of 26.5%, 27% and we expect overtime that that will move back upwards as the discretionary category performance strengthens.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "", "Last question I just want to ask Greg is that we talked at the analyst meeting in terms of the opportunities to improve price perception, you also mentioned again today. It seems like you have done incredible amount of work and my hats off to you at the low price promise et cetera. What else can be done and is it just really a matter of time more than anything else?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we really view this as a marathon and not a sprint and so we are going to continue to strike the right balance between expect more and pay less and we are going to continue to work hard to be not only right in reality, but work on the perception aspect and that's a series of marketing initiative that goes from one end to the other broadcast, print, special events, direct, receipt [ph] tape marketing, it's in store presentation and impact, it's content we put on end caps, it's really a holistic merchandising marketing effort that we have to more clearly communicating their credit for the great prices that we already have in store.", "Doug Scovanner", "Following up on earlier question, $1.1 billion of sales on our cards in the fourth quarter represented 5.6% of our total sales, 5.6% penetration of our sales on our cards.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with JPMorgan.", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "", "In January the Home category showed a little bit of life, Kathy, just wondering if your expectations there for a positive comp in 2010 and then also wondering if you could share an update with us on February sales month, today your tone I have to say is drastically better than it was 3 months ago?", "Kathy Tesija", "We are definitely seeing Home start to turn the corner. As I mentioned a lot of basic categories, we are seeing a lot of strength there but in addition, I would say some of our better invest product also there is pockets of strength, I mentioned the Giada De Laurentiis launch which is right on track on our forecast, we are thrilled with those results and Smith & Hawken, another high end brand is off to a great start this spring as well, but in some of our own brands like Room Essentials which is in the opening price point level, lot of strengths and building a lot of momentum there in those basic category. So we do see Home starting to turn the corner, but I would say it will be a long road throughout the year to get to where we want to be, but we feel like we are making progress.", "Doug Scovanner", "With respect to you February question as you know at the beginning of the month we said we expected to be a flat to up slightly for the month and clearly we are on track to record our third consecutive month of positive same store sales performance here in February. ", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "And then my second question, it\u2019s with regards to the PFresh, at the analyst day you said by year three you thought gross profit margins in that category would be roughly 21%. You look at the grocers and let's exclude wholefoods from the equation; most of the grocers have GPM significantly higher than that. So, I am wondering one of you just being conservative or two, is there something structural that prohibits you from obtaining gross profit margins staying at 24% to 25% bucket longer-term. ", "Doug Scovanner", "", "I wouldn't call it structural, I'd call it strategic. We have a firm policy to be level priced with Wal-Mart locally on like items and the grocers you are referring to absolutely do not have such a policy. So in our zeal to execute that strategy, it drives a gross margin rate sharply lower than the average grocer because the average grocer can't compete with Wal-Mart on price.", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "And then last one for you Doug, in the Master Trust yesterday, there was a disclosure to eliminate about $19 million inactive accounts over the next couple of months. Is there anything that's going to impact the first quarter in credit from that initiative?", "Doug Scovanner", "", "Directly no, but certainly indirectly we have been on a campaign for better than a year to eliminate risk in the portfolio from relatively inactive accounts springing forth, charging up and writing off. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "", "I know the gross margin performance for the year was pretty spectacular and you want to maintain this, but as you think about just 6 basis points of negative mix here in the fourth quarter and then the moving parts around structural growth of food, the stronger growth of PFresh but that improving discretionary hopefully recovery in some of those categories that gains momentum through the year. Can you give us a little bit more help on your view of how those different impacts affect the gross margin, what you think the combined and mix effect might be in 2010?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well, certainly, PFresh is a lead discussion point in this arena. The mix of sales driven out of those stores alone in isolation will likely reduce our gross margin rate for the year something in the range of 20 to 30 basis points in consolidation. Separately in the mix impact of a normalized set of growth rates ignoring those remodels in an average year in history has been another 20 or 30 basis points and a lot more than that for most of the last couple of years. So I think we are starting from an adjusted base that could be down 20, 40, 60 basis points before we talk about margin rate improvements within categories that are opportunities. ", "Net net, we just don't think its prudent to think that anyone should take last year's all-time record high gross margin rate and believe that the net of these factors would increase in the middle of the road forecast. Certainly nothing we do will inhibit that from occurring, if we can do it while remaining price competitive with Wal-Mart and while continuing to produce spectacular values for our guest in these more discretionary categories. It could happen, I just wouldn't predict it. I'll reiterate that I don't believe the path to prosperity is paved with the idea of enhancing operating margins in our retail segment. I firmly believe that we'll get there by rejuvenating our top line performance while preserving our very strong margin rate structure top to bottom.", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "And then just a follow-up likewise on expenses again, a stunningly good performance in 2009 with only 10 stores opening in 2010, we've seen a mid-single digit if your comps are going to be 3% to 4%, mid-single digit 3% to 4% expense dollar growth, it'll will be pretty robust. Could you do better than that?", "Doug Scovanner", "Obviously, we could do better than that. There are lot of puts and takes in expenses. Actually, one of the things that is a headwind, not a tailwind is the combined impact of remodel startup, new store startup and accelerated depreciation due to the remodels. So, that's actually something that will hold back expense performance. On the positive side, we have a set of incentive plans that are deeply intertwined on a pay-for-performance philosophy and it would require way over the top performance in 2010 compared to anything we're talking about today for incentive compensation expense in 2010 to approach what we recorded in 2009. So, there are some other pluses and minuses but on the combined front of the P&L impact of remodeling and new store activity, certainly new store activity in isolation will be a benefit, but the remodeling activity is larger in its expense component than the benefit of backing off with new store openings. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital. ", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Two questions, Doug, on the credit piece. First, when you look at the credit performance overall versus maybe what you expected six to nine months ago, is it fair to say that the credit business is getting more predictable every month? And then the second question that I have is a follow up to Chuck's question about the 19 million accounts. When you cut off the 19 million accounts, do you expect that to hinder at all your comp store sales performance in the back half of the year and did JPMorgan have any influence on that decision on the 19 million accounts?", "Doug Scovanner", "The 19 million accounts will have no impact on our same store sales moving forward whatsoever. And even though I wasn't personally involved in any discussions with the Chase Card Services team I feel very confident in predicting that they would concur that that was an intelligent risk based decision. More broadly, our card segment went through a fairly scary period during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and beginning with the first quarter of 2009 moved back into a more traditional era of stability and predictability albeit at quite heightened levels of risk. ", "We've made a lot of predictions a year ago, some of them we ended up well exceeding the predictions we laid out, the forward-looking statements we laid out for our card segment by and large turned out to be spot on. We predicted $300 million plus or minus in write-offs in each of the first two quarters, that's exactly what happened. We predicted a little less than that in Q3, it's exactly what happened. Due to a little bit of an echo of expected write-offs from the terms change in May, we predicted we expected write-offs to tick up a bit in Q4, that's again exactly what happened. Looking forward, Q1 write-offs will look a lot like Q4 write-offs and I expect Q2, Q3, Q4 to be lower as the portfolio shrinks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Actually Kathy I think this is probably a question for you. I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the guest surveys, I think the better guests behavior that you are commenting on at the beginning of the call, that you've seen recently kind of conflicts with the tumbling in consumer confidence that we're seeing out this morning. I was just curious if you could sort of tell us, is there something that Target might be seeing that's more unique to your customer demographics or we all cross our fingers and hope this consumer confidence number is a head fake. Any kind of further thoughts on what you're hearing from your customers would be great. Thanks.", "Kathy Tesija", "", "Hard to predict if that was a head fake or not but what I will tell you is we've been talking to our guest over the past 18 months as I mentioned and we have clearly seen her describe her feelings going from a place of fear, how am I going to manage, how am I going to retool my budget, how am I going to make it all work, to a place of pride and confidence that she has weathered that stormed and has been able to make her budget work and now is selectively starting to come a bit more often and to spend a bit more money in some of the discretionary categories. Do I think that she thinks she is completely optimistic no, but I think she has a good handle on where her family is right now and that Target has great value and the right product that she is looking for which is translated in to a few more trips and a bit more spending in our discretionary side.", "Doug Scovanner", "", "Yeah, I would just add that whether it's a head fake or not nobody really knows, but we expect the recovery to be slow and steady. But that doesn't mean that it's not going to be without its difficulties and speed bumps and setbacks. I think we're going to be in the kind of environment where there's going to be a lot of mixed signals.", "I think we're going to see two steps forward, one step back. We're going to see results that we really like and then I think that there maybe a slight pull back. So I think that the year is going to be one of those years where there is a lot of arrows pointing in a lot of different directions and it's going to take some time before you can really sort through all the complexities and the variety of dynamics that are operating in the marketplace.", "Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And then just a quick follow up, on your comp guidance of two to four, the math to get from sort of zero to one trend now to a, lets say, we were going to try and get to the top end of that guidance to the four. Is it sort of 50% improvement in transaction size and 50% ticket or is there -- sorry, number of transactions and ticket? Can you tell me have they both improved the same or has traffic improved more? What the thinking is there overall?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We really don't know. We would be elated if we got to the top end of that number. Clearly where we remodel stores and we do PFresh, we're going to see a greater percentage of the sales being reflected in the traffic in those particular remodel 350 kind of stores. In the other stores we think it\u2019s going to be more balanced between both traffic and ticket. But, again it\u2019s pretty speculative. We're really not sure. It does move around from month to month.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Maybe Greg you started to answer it there, in the two to four comp plan for this year, what is the traffic versus ticket mix that's implicit in that and also the deflation part of it?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, again we have seen some once gains in traffic. So we think that that's going to be the primary driver of the same store sales but not exclusively. So it will be as it has been over many years, a combination of both traffic and ticket and we really don't know what ultimately it's going to sell in at but our best guess today would be more from traffic than ticket but a combination of both.", "Doug Scovanner", "Historically, we've never got into a comp above four without contributions from both, and so I think that more likely than not it will be positive contributions from each if we get there.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And then second question, on the inflation you talked about how in food certainly there is a lot of well documented history there and we'll see when that turns. But if you go around the rest of the store, what are you seeing for your buy into the summer into the third quarter in terms of inflation or lack thereof in some of the other direct import categories like the apparel and home.", "Kathy Tesija", "So at this point we have not finished sourcing all of fall but certainly through the third quarter and right now for that period, we're essentially flat in apparel and up slightly in home and we think that will hold for our fourth quarter as well.", "So a lot of talk about the raw materials, cost increases that has been happening but those today have not resulted in higher costs yet. We think perhaps by spring of 2011 we'll start to see some cost increases but for the fall really apparel being flat and home just up slightly.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "I think we'll continue to see some deflation in hard line, particularly in electronics. It's a category that has traditionally been deflationary, moves around a little bit in terms of the level of deflation but I would expect something in a 2% to 4% range there and other categories will be stable.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And then a follow up on that. You mentioned the Bullseye rolling out 800 stores in your comments. That's the RadioShack kiosk, is that\u2026.", "Kathy Tesija", "Correct, yes.", "Gregory Melich - Morgan Stanley", "And when was that by?", "Kathy Tesija", "October, we have 100 stores now and we will expand that throughout the year to 800 by October.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We have time for two more questions please.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Doug, I had a credit question and then Kathy I had a question on general merchandise side. On the credit side Gregg, I know it\u2019s ways out from potential changes in regulation and impacts late fees but if you looked internally, just to take the most onerous set of legislations that would impact you and you look at that at '11, could the income from late fees drop to $250 million a year or have you looked at it that way and all? ", "Doug Scovanner", "It certainly could and if that were to occur, then I believe that we and virtually every other competitor in the industry would adjust other features of the economic model or to be able offset it I think that I'm not sure this notion is understood inside that way.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Do you think you would be able to fully offset all of that?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well if we didn't you'd see a shrinking industry which is why I think that the legislation is conversely anti stimulate.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "And clearly there could be some time delay from the time that something is impacted or the time that said finally reaches their decision and the time that we can make those kind of adjustments. So there could be some short term implications but over the long term we're just going to readjust.", "Doug Scovanner", "", "To Gregg's very point we will need to see what the Fed's regulations have to say but that could easily envision a scenario where that would adversely impact our credit card segment ROICs Q3 Q4 until we figured out how to continue to produce an offering that's viewed as quite valuable by our guests in the competitive environment. But that could happen.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "And second question related to credit. Is the test that you have going on in the Kansas City now with the 5% kind of rebate if you will, are you finding that people are actually revolving on the card once they use it or are they paying it off and if they are just paying it off how does that impact the profit model of that initiative?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "", "It's a great set of questions. Certainly there is a different set of behaviors for existing card holders versus new card holders. In each group there is sharply higher use and therefore sharply higher sales. The new card holders by and large are of sufficiently high credit quality that they have a much, much lower propensity to revolve and therefore as we sort through the pieces of this equation, we need to pay careful attention to both the retail segment impacts and the credit card segment impacts but net, net regardless of how we transfer price between the two segments there is clearly a compelling equation that we continue to analyze to figure our whether this is something that is sufficiently profitable to consider a rolling out on a much larger scale.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Kathy I just wanted to see on the Great Save event that you had do you plan on replicating that in the coming years and what did you learn that would roll back into the assortment now of key items that might have been selling that you need to put in the assortment and the source has been going now that you have seen some clearance in those items. I was a little surprised to see that for Kellogg Cereal for example. Why not just roll that in why it clearly just let it roll through.", "Kathy Tesija", "It's a little early for us to determine if we will repeat the great save. We were very happy with the performance. As you know we have value events and have had them couple of times a year for many, many years and so I think that what the great save brought was slightly larger sizes as well as all around the store we had a lot of home products in there and apparel products or historically our value events have been commodities and food.", "So we are pleased with the events. The markdowns that we filled that space with that special product, some of them went back to the home to en-cap but not all of them would fit in the home just given the size of those packages. So we do consider it a seasonal event and clear it and move on to the next season which is now our Patio set.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Just quick question on e-commerce. What did that contribute to comps for the year? How is that performing relative to total sales and what are your expectations for that in 2010?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "On a total year basis, sales patterns were fairly similar to what we experienced in the store where we were more challenged earlier in the year and we saw strengthening at the end of the year and when you wash it all the way through, it was pretty close to the store in general in terms of a modest or a slight same store sales decrease over the last year. But just like in the store side of the business, we're starting to see a nice recovery there and some better signs than we've seen in some time. So we're optimistic that that's going to grow at or greater than the total store growth this year.", "Doug Scovanner", "Just adding a little color to Gregg's comment, please remember that our online business is much more heavily skewed toward discretionary product categories than many other online businesses.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "That includes Target's fourth quarter and year-end 2009 earnings conference call.

", "As a reminder we're joined on this call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via web cast. Following this conference call John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. ", "Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Earlier this morning we announced that our first quarter earnings per share rose 30% from a year ago to $0.90, well above our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. As we previously indicated this performance is the highest quarterly EPS in our history, other than a fourth quarter and we are extremely pleased with the effectiveness of our strategy and proud of the superb execution by our team.", "Our comparable store sales increased 2.8% in the quarter reflecting the right combination of fashion and basic merchandise at outstanding prices, compelling presentation and in stocks, and outstanding services by stores\u2019 teams. ", "This is the largest comparable store sales increase in 10 quarters and represents a meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. Comparable store transactions were up more than 2% for the quarter. When guests visited our stores stronger than expected demand for categories like apparel made their trips more profitable, as the items in their baskets represented a healthy gross margin mix. ", "Kathy will provide additional detail on our category performance in a few minutes. In addition to strong gross margin performance, our teams turned in another fantastic quarter on the expense line. Store productivity increased even while guest satisfaction scores continued to improve. ", "In our credit card segment, receivables balances continued to decline while profit flowing to Target grew to almost three times last year\u2019s first quarter performance as risk indicators turned more favorable than expected in an improving economy. ", "Doug will provide more detail on both our credit card segment performance and our retail segment results later in this call. Clearly the economy and consumer sentiment have improved since their weakest point in 2009, but we believe that both are still somewhat unstable and fragile and will likely continue to experience occasional set backs as the year progresses. ", "Persistently high unemployment rates and large deficits at both the state and federal level will continue to create uncertainty and volatility. As a result we continue to be cautious regarding our sales outlook in order to prudently manage our expenses while controlling inventory on mark down sensitive merchandise. ", "We take this approach to mitigate our downside risks, while at the same time we work to prepare our teams to move quickly if we see unexpected strength. This is precisely what occurred in the first quarter. ", "Our 2010 [P Fresh] remodel program is off to a great start. During the first quarter we completed the renovation of 96 stores in 13 markets with the greatest concentration in the Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, DC metro markets. ", "Its important to note that in this quarter alone we remodeled more stores than we typically complete in an entire year. In contrast to P Fresh remodels completed in 2009, which focused primarily on food, this year\u2019s remodels include transformations throughout the store, in home, beauty, electronics, video games and in shoes, starting in July. ", "We continuously refine our processes with each set of remodels, leading to reduced guest disruption, shorter construction times, and effective control of remodel expenditures. And while many of these remodels have only just been completed recently the results so far have exceeded our expectations. ", "Our guests tell us they love the convenience and experience of the new layout and expanded grocery selection and total store sales lifts have been higher than in last year\u2019s remodels. In addition, we\u2019ve seen some early indication that the changes outside of food are leading to more cross shopping. ", "As a result we believe that this initiative will transform our general merchandise stores insuring we remain relevant and deliver a superb shopping experience, while meeting our exceeding a return on investment expectation for capital investments in our stores. ", "Looking forward we\u2019ll remodel more than 240 additional stores this year with completions spread roughly equally between the second and third quarters. By the end of the third quarter we expect to have more than 450 general merchandise locations, with the P Fresh assortment and presentation.", "And in many of these locations the changes outside of food are so extensive the completed renovations resemble a brand new Target store. As we\u2019ve indicated previously we are on track to open 13 new Target stores in 2010, all in the second and third quarters. ", "Net of closings and relocations, these openings will add about 10 locations to the chain. We\u2019re particularly excited about the planned opening of our first Manhattan location in Spanish Harlem this July. ", "In our marketing we launched a new campaign this month, Life\u2019s a Moving Target. Leveraging our infinitely flexible expect more pay less brand promise, this new campaign has two important facets; broadcast spots that use story-telling to strengthen the emotional connection with our guests during every stage of their lives, and shorter punctuated humorous spots that suggest items from our roster of trusted brands as solutions for their every day challenges. ", "All aspects of this new campaign celebrate the fact that Target is the right destination for all of our guests\u2019 wants and needs at a great value, appropriately balancing both sides of our brand promise. This is an exciting time for Target. Teams throughout the organization are focused on driving innovation, transforming our stores and our merchandise assortments, and enhancing our outstanding guest experience. ", "They are focused more than ever on delivering both sides of our expect more pay less brand promise, consistently delighting our guests with great prices and unique merchandise in safe, well designed stores with fast, fun, and friendly service. ", "I continue to be proud of this team and the results they deliver every day. Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights\u2019 research and additional information on our merchandising initiatives. ", "Kathy Tesija", "Thanks Gregg, as we look back at the first quarter we are proud that we stayed the course during the past couple of years. While we remain flexible in our tactics, we never strayed from our expect more pay less strategy, our commitment to continuous innovation, and our goal of providing a superior shopping environment with great guest service. ", "The dedication and discipline of our teams helped us successfully navigate the depths of the recession and today we\u2019re more committed than ever to delivering a relevant and compelling assortment that surprises guests with its quality and value. ", "While the economic environment remains somewhat volatile consumers have become much more confident in their ability to manage their spending and carefully select those discretionary items that satisfy their wants at a value that doesn\u2019t break their budgets. ", "To be sure there are many households that continue to feel the direct impact of job loss, and other forms of financial stress resulting from the recession. However a much larger portion of our guests did feel such a direct impact from the recession but instead, became extremely cautious in their buying behavior. ", "Those guests paid off debt, created and stuck with budgets, and now they\u2019re feeling optimistic enough to begin putting well-considered discretionary items back into their baskets. Many have begun to indulge in small ways with our discretionary assortment provides the perfect opportunity for them to indulge while feeling smart about the decision.", "We are seeing this trend particularly in home and apparel. Guests are starting to buy clothing and accessory items for themselves. Both men and women are freshening up their casual wardrobes, replacing basic work pieces, and picking up new shoes and accessories for spring.", "In our home category stagnant real estate markets are driving homeowners to make small, affordable investments in their homes such as updating their bath and bedding with new towels and sheets, or adding excitement and color to their living spaces with new decorative accessories. ", "Our guests are demonstrating that their eager to purchase items when the styles and price are right. Across both apparel and home our recent collaboration with Liberty of London was an undisputed success. It launched in mid-March with an offering of more than 300 items across several areas of the store that were the perfect mix of color, print, and spring time optimism. ", "Sales of the collection both in store and online were well above expectations and were strong in all categories, with the most popular items in women\u2019s tops and accessories, girl\u2019s dresses, table tops, and storage. ", "Our own brands continue to resonate with guests generating loyalty and delivering outstanding value. In the 2009 relaunch of our household commodity brand as up and up has been highly successful and this year we plan to add another 100 items. ", "We\u2019re enjoying similar success with the relaunch of Circo, with sales in the infant toddler category up double-digits over last year. In home guests have responded very favorably to the relaunch of both our room essentials and home brand. We\u2019ve better clarified the assortments, provided more clear design esthetic, developed new packaging that highlights the most important benefits and features, and improved the quality of both lines.", "Results have been outstanding with the two brands combining for a mid single-digit comparable store sales increase in the first quarter. We continue to pursue innovation at an unprecedented pace. The recession taught us to be even more creative, aggressive, and disciplined in bringing new and profitable items to our guests.", "One of the most exciting innovations is our electronics and video games reinvention, which will be in all stores by the end of June. We are turning this area of the store into a cohesive electronics and gaming destination. ", "The new TV wall provides a compelling focal point for the department with realistic viewing angles that showcase our quality assortment. Our TV delivery and installation service continues to be enthusiastically received by our guests, both for its convenience and value. ", "Positioned right next to electronics the video game category remains one of the highest productivity areas of the store. Our new more welcoming environment, easier game access, better-organized assortment, and enhanced information tools are driving positive guest feedback and enhanced conversion. ", "Our guests are also excited that the Amazon Kindle will roll out to all Target stores nationwide on June 6. We\u2019re currently the exclusive bricks and mortar retailer for this popular e-reader which practically flew off the shelves during our 100-store test. ", "Guests love this product because its fits their busy lifestyles, allowing them to get all the news and books they want most in one incredibly light, portable, easy to read product. We continue to pursue compelling cross merchandising offerings particularly when they tie into the hottest entertainment releases of the season. ", "In toys we\u2019ve created a must see in store destination for guests interested in the latest and greatest theatrical releases like Iron Man 2 and Toy Story 3. This fresh approach to merchandising movie releases creates a store within a store environment with movie related product including toys, clothing, bedding, and video games centralized in a boutique like experience. ", "Our commitment to differentiation is as strong as ever. We are excited that Caldrea, the luxurious brand of household products has developed a line that\u2019s now available at Target stores nationwide. The Caldrea Essentials collection is affordably priced, from $5.99 to $19.99, and offers our guests superior cleaning products and candles in luxurious scents for their entire home. ", "In fashion our collaboration with red carpet design favorite Zac Posen, launched in late April, with 44 pieces ranging from $16.99 to $200.00. We worked with Zac to create a collection that is fresh and fun reflecting his esthetic, lux fabrics, and modern pop culture. ", "Also currently in stores are the fantastic lines from Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Cynthia\u2019s limited edition footwear collection launched mid April and will be available until July. Eugenia Kim\u2019s collection of timeless hats is the first of its kind at Target and will be available mid April through the end of June. ", "And we\u2019re looking ahead to the back to college and back to school season when Target will be ready with the right assortments at the right price in a compelling and easy to shop environment. This critical season is an important opportunity for us to win the loyalty of our newly independent guests and create life long Target fans. ", "We experienced great success even in last year\u2019s challenging environment and anticipate more favorable results this year. We\u2019ll drive this momentum by providing must have items at affordable prices keeping our college guests coming back to Target for all their wants and needs. ", "We are also focused on further cross channel innovation including the development of new mobile features and intelligent shopping tools that allow our guests to easily manage their budgets and plan store trips. We are extending our lead in mobile retail with an aggressive roadmap for innovation.", "In March we announced that Target is the first retailer with the scanning technology at checkout to the gift card and coupon barcodes on mobile devices in all our stores nationwide. And in April we introduced the ability for guests to create lists and manage registries using their mobile devices. ", "At the same time we launched a new feature to the iPhone app that lets guests scan items and search for product availability at other Target locations, access rating reviews, view extended assortments, and add items to a gift registry or list. ", "The changes we\u2019ve made in response to the recession have positioned us to perform better in this and any economic environment. We remain focused on the most important factor driving our business, our guests, by delivering the quality and value they crave, the products they want and need, in stores that are clean, well organized and efficient to shop, we will reinforce our standing as their trusted friend in both daily essentials and pleasant surprises. ", "Now Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the second quarter. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Thanks Kathy, in my remarks today I plan to review our first quarter results in both business segments, and then I\u2019ll provide my perspective on our outlook for the upcoming quarter and the remainder of the year. ", "As Gregg outlined our first quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, as both of our business segments well exceeded their respective profit plans. Beyond a comparison to our own expectations, our consolidated performance was also remarkable in comparison to our past results as our 2010 first quarter EPS of $0.90 was $0.08 higher than our results from continuing operations in any other non-holiday quarter in our history. ", "In our retail segment sales increased 5.5% due to a 2.8% increase in comparable store sales and a similar contribution from our new stores. Year over year same store traffic trends were up 2.2% driving about 3/4 of our comparable store sales increase. ", "By any historical standard, this is a very healthy traffic trend. Our gross margin rate was 31.3% of sales, half a point above last year\u2019s strong performance and it reflected a new first quarter record. The year over year increase in gross margin was entirely the result of rate increases within categories. ", "In other words the impact of sales mix on our gross margin rate was essentially neutral because the pace of sales in our higher margin categories was in line with the pace in lower margin consumable and commodity categories. ", "We\u2019ve experienced this kind of sales mix dynamic occasionally in the past, yet it has never lasted for very long because of the essence of our long-term traffic building growth strategy. Retail segment SG&A expenses were 20.6% of sales in the first quarter reflecting 30 basis points of favorable leverage. ", "This improvement was primarily the result of continued productivity improvements in our stores. We also recorded all time records in reported first quarter retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as gross margin and expense rates both improved and these improvements more than offset the deleveraging of depreciation and amortization expense. ", "In our credit card segment we enjoyed a sharp increase in all of our measures of profitability and returns on capital, as a direct result of a rapid improvement in several key risk metrics. In particular favorable trends in delinquencies give us confidence that the likely future write-off experience resulting from new credit extended in the quarter will be significantly improved from our current write-off experience. ", "As you know a few weeks ago we announced that we\u2019ve begun to offer only the Target credit card to qualified applicants, although we will continue to service the five million active Target Visa accounts outstanding today and these accounts will likely continue to make up the vast majority of our receivables portfolio for some time to come. ", "We\u2019ve made this decision after reviewing the results of a carefully drawn parallel test in which we learned that in the current environment new credit card guests spend considerably more in our stores when issued a Target credit card as opposed to a Target Visa card.", "Separately we continue to measure the results from our Kansas City and San Antonio test markets in which we\u2019re piloting a totally different and greatly simplified credit card rewards program. Incremental sales results remain especially intriguing in Kansas City. ", "The Card Act which became law last year, reduced the number of tools we and other card issuers formally used to differentiate pricing to accommodate lending to different pools of borrowers with varying risk characteristics. Of course this has had the direct impact of reducing the availability of credit to American households. ", "Yet another layer of new restrictions from this Act take effect this August which will reduce our late fee income from that point forward. For reference, late fees contributed a little over three percentage points of annualized pre-tax yield in our portfolio in the quarter. ", "Turning to briefly to generation and application of cash, in the first quarter we generated nearly $1.2 billion from our operating activities, up about 16% from last year\u2019s first quarter. Together with $1.6 billion of marketable securities on hand at the beginning of the period, we applied these combined resources during the quarter to retire about $1.2 billion of debt, to invest a little more than $400 million of capital to grow our core business and to invest just under $400 million in our ongoing share repurchase program.", "At the end of the quarter we continued to have about a billion dollars of immediate liquidity on hand. Now let\u2019s discuss our prospects for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Our sales results so far in May are running somewhat behind our expectations for a low to mid single-digit increase.", "Through two weeks we\u2019re essentially flat to last year yet we do not believe this two weeks sales performance will hinder our ability to generate comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range in the second quarter and in the fall season as well. ", "On the gross margin line, we expect to return to some moderate rate pressures as the year progresses as we expect to experience a more typical impact of sales mix than we enjoyed in the first quarter. ", "We expect to offset some or all of this gross margin rate issue with continued productivity improvements in our stores, and through other means. Of course quarterly data will naturally reflect more volatility than annual data due to the relative impact of generally non-recurring items, and year over year timing differences. ", "Notably in the second quarter we expect a roughly neutral year over year SG&A expense rate due in part to a retiming of marketing expenses within 2010. As a reminder our second quarter results will also reflect an increment of accelerated depreciation due to our 2010 remodel program.", "In our credit card segment we expect many of our first quarter trends to carry into future quarters, specifically we expect a continued decline in our receivables portfolio and we expect to sustain meaningful year over year improvement in bad debt expense throughout the remainder of 2010 followed by declining net write-off experience as well. ", "This late fee issue I described earlier will offset some of this good news. Final late fee regulations are well, late. I guess that\u2019s because no regulation currently governs the timing of issuance of regulations. The bottom line here is that today we can only estimate the likely impact. As a general rule we think that up to about half of our late fee income is likely to go away and that compares to the $59 million we recorded in the first quarter. ", "I have one final comment on financial reporting in this segment before turning to our consolidated outlook, we retired our last remaining publically traded receivables backed securities in the quarter and as a result we will no longer be filing monthly 8-K reports reflecting the performance of our receivables portfolio. ", "Since some of you seem to want more frequent than quarterly reporting of credit card risk metrics, we will begin posting on our website a monthly series of our credit card delinquency statistics. Generally we expect to provide this fresh data on the same day we release monthly sales statistics, beginning next month. ", "Now let\u2019s spend a moment on our expectations for earnings per share in the upcoming quarter and for the remainder of the year. The current first call medium estimates are $0.91 for the second quarter and $3.81 for the year. Based on our outlook in each of our two business segments these are both reasonable single point estimates for our future performance as of today. ", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We\u2019re very pleased with our first quarter performance and believe it validates our strategy. We are confident that we have the right plans in place and the right team to implement them. While the pace of the current economic recovery will continue to effect consumer spending behavior, we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to deliver strong results and to continue to create meaningful shareholder value over time.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, now Doug, Kathy, and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "The first question I have is on the May results, on the May sales trends that you talked about, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more in terms of what you think is happening in the back half of April for you and then sort of month to date, I guess from a broader perspective. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "I would just tell you that as we\u2019ve said all year its going to be volatile. There is going to be good months, bad months, and some ups and downs and I think we\u2019re seeing an environment where that kind of volatility and unpredictability is just playing out in the consumer environment. ", "We cited a number of consumer facing issues that I think are weighing on the minds of consumers and I think that from our perspective we\u2019re going to continue to see this throughout the balance of the year. We\u2019re going to find good weeks, bad weeks, good weeks, and bad months. ", "", "Doug Scovanner", "Separately as you know we don\u2019t like talking about the weather, but in a period of time as short as the period you\u2019re focused on, the weather can never be ignored and the weather wasn\u2019t very good during the first two weeks of May. Now, I\u2019ll quickly observe as I have many times before that over time on average the weather is average. ", "So, you shouldn\u2019t hear us talking much about the weather except when questions are asked about such a short period of time. ", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "On the credit card business when you look at the spread of the charge-off rate versus the bad debt expense do you think that that spread is sustainable for the next several quarters. ", "Doug Scovanner", "I hope not because I expect and hope that the net write-off dollars will come down to approximate our quarterly provisioning within the next several quarters. So, in short, the provision in the quarter, the expense in the quarter give or take $200 million is well below the charge-offs in the quarter but I expect that our net write-offs per quarter will be closer to $200 million than $300 million beginning in the second quarter, beginning right now. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "Let me ask Bob\u2019s question a little bit differently, if receivables are going to be say $7 billion at the end of the year and presumably going, potentially meaningfully lower in 2011, what do you think the appropriate balance would be for allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the year. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well our allowance for doubtful accounts was 12.7% of receivables at year end, one quarter ago, and 12.8% of receivables right now. So essentially the allowance in the quarter moved directly in line with the reduction in receivables. ", "If risks unfold during the year, consistent with the significant improvement that we\u2019ve seen here in Q1 then of course that percentage will fall perhaps by a couple of percentage points at the outside. I still expect even under the most rosy outlook that the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables will still be a double-digit percentage by year end. ", "Now having said that last year we saw pretty significant improvement in risks early and then the improvement in risks slowed down measurably so I think it\u2019s a bit premature to be thinking about much of a significant change in our allowance as a percent of gross receivables from the current 12.8% figure. ", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "When we last spoke you noted that Wal-Mart, their roll back in [inaudible] and the price gap was in the low double-digits in a number of items on rollback had increased modestly, I was wondering if any of these figures had changed and if you could kind of speak to the competitive environment particularly given that Wal-Mart\u2019s taken another step down on their deep rollback campaign. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well nothing has really changed since we talked. The rollbacks at Wal-Mart announced earlier were really for a period of 90 days so we\u2019re in the early stages of that. The competitive environment continues to be aggressive but reasonable like it always is. Its generally very competitive and that continues to be so but we have not seen any meaningful change in what Wal-Mart has done over the last 30 or 60 days. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie \u2013 UBS ", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS ", "First of all a number of retailers have been talking about increasing sourcing costs coming in the second half of the year and now this may apply more to next year as I\u2019m sure your apparel sourcing is already underway for the rest of this year, but I wondered what your outlook was on sourcing costs coming out of Asia and also what your attitude could be towards passing through price increases. ", "Kathy Tesija", "So you are correct there are costing pressures coming through and its on a number of different categories from cotton to paper, copper, synthetic fabrics, even transportation. But what we have booked for the fall, or coming for this fall is we don\u2019t have cost increases coming so perhaps late fall or if we start chasing products there might be some increases to that. ", "But certainly in the spring I think we will start to see some of the cost increases come through. And we\u2019ll have to look at each product category independently, how large the increase is, and then whether or not we will pass it along or try to reengineer the product to keep the retail and the margin where it is. ", "But we will start to see some cost increases in receipts that will hit in spring, 2011.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS ", "And about employee expenses, you did a great job last year, the last 18 months really of reducing employee expenses, I wonder as sales recover or continue to recover whether you still feel that service levels are good or whether you might have to start increasing some labor hours in the stores. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The labor hours in the stores are going to be reflective of the performance and the sales within the stores, so we\u2019re focused on expense management, productivity management, improving efficiencies within our supply chain but as the recovery, assuming the recovery continues to proceed and sales continue to improve we\u2019ll had to add some variable labor within our stores to accommodate increases in sales. ", "But its our intentions to still manage our expenses tightly and make sure that we are leveraging the sales performance that we do get. We\u2019re not seeing any labor rate inflation at this particular point in time nor do we expect to see that for the foreseeable future. ", "Doug Scovanner", "We\u2019re enjoying the double benefits of wonderful improvements in productivity inside our stores, and experiencing record high guest service levels and we intensively measure those service levels through the eyes of our guests. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "I had a question related to the credit business, what impact if at all will be the changes in the credit card offer that you have now, exclusively the Target card, on the third party merchant fees which has been about $100 million, if at all anything. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well as you know we earn those third party merchant fees when our Target Visa cards are used anywhere else Visa is accepted, at Wal-Mart for example, and elsewhere, we profit from that merchant fee when the Target Visa card is used. ", "Over time that certainly will reduce that line item will reduce in line with Target Visa balances but at the moment I would not expect that the yield impact, the impact on profitability and return on capital is likely to change. ", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "And my second question related to credit is the late fee impact, you talked about if I think I heard you correctly, maybe 50% and I\u2019m wondering as you roll that into 2011 and you get a full year of that, could we be looking at late fee income that might approximate $150 million or how are you thinking about as you roll that into the full year 2011 and your ability to offset some of that erosion. ", "", "Doug Scovanner", "Well in isolation of course the late fee income impact is just in line with what you\u2019re laying out, your math is good. But of course the reaction of all card issuers, not just Target is to reduce the amount of credit available to the lower end of the file, to the lower end of the portfolio, where we can no longer recover sufficient late fee income to make sense out of lending. ", "So the quite direct impact of the Card Act is to significantly reduce the availability of credit to American households, so, we\u2019ll essentially offset that through underwriting and risk management by enjoying a better write-off and bad debt expense experience by no longer lending to pools of households with those kinds of risks. ", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Some of the success you\u2019re seeing right now, essentially in apparel area, are you thinking about that rather than having these swing through a particular season, maybe adding them to the assortment on a more sustainable basis because demand is so strong, you\u2019ve done that with some things in the past. I\u2019m just wondering if there are things that we should be thinking about that you could bring in that\u2019s more sustainable. ", "Kathy Tesija", "I think the beauty of the programs that we\u2019ve brought in have been the fact that they are limited time and that we\u2019re able to fit them to the season with the right esthetic as well as the right color pallet and apply them to the right merchandise. So if we talk about Liberty it was the perfect scenario in the spring. It was very optimistic, the colors were really bright and cheerful which lended themselves well to Liberty\u2019s print and pattern.", "So we like the ability to be able to move through different designers or partnerships that really help us to keep our content fresh and so certainly when there are successes we analyze what worked and what didn\u2019t and try to apply those to the future but in terms of keeping any of those on a long-term basis, we\u2019re committed to having some designers that are long-term which you\u2019re well aware of in our portfolio, but to keep that freshness going as we roll through some of the limited time offers. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I just wanted to clarify given what your guests are doing are you seeing within categories I think you said they\u2019re reaching more or opening up their wallets or whatever, are they up scaling their purchases, are they trading back up in price points within categories and then the second question I had is just on the remodels you have been doing even through the first quarter here, is there any negative impact on comps as the remodels are being done and also you commented on the performance being above planned, is the food lift exceeding expectations as well, the P Fresh component, or is it really home, beauty, electronics, video games, etc., that\u2019s really doing stronger post remodel than you thought. ", "", "Kathy Tesija", "So the first question on whether or not we\u2019re seeing trade up, all along we have had higher end product that has done well and an example would be C9 which is our highest quality in apparel and it has done well throughout the recession. But in general I would say there\u2019s not a resurgence to trading up to more products like that, I would say that its more about guests feeling a little bit more comfortable putting an extra discretionary item in their basket.", "So we\u2019re seeing those mixed trips where they\u2019re buying needs and wants starting to increase. Your second question about remodels, and is there any negative to sales, when we start the remodel there is a negative impact to sales as we disrupt the stores, but that\u2019s being offset by the sales that we\u2019re experiencing once they are set.", "So there isn\u2019t a negative. And in total all areas are up at or expectation or above which would include food as well as the others you mentioned like home and beauty.", "Doug Scovanner", "We\u2019ve previously disclosed that we expect the net impact of this remodel activity for the year to add about one full point to our reported same store sales performance during the first quarter. That net figure was between two and three tenths of a percentage point because the mix of course of stores that are under duress being remodeled is a much larger factor relative to the number of stores that have been remodeled and are producing the strong results we\u2019ve described. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The last comment I would make, this is in aggregation and really these remodels, store by store situation in some cases we see very little disruption because of the fact that the store happens to be newer and there\u2019s less reconstruction within the stores. In other cases in older stores or where we might have an older format or multiple entrances or multiple levels, the extensive nature of that reconstruction is more disruptive and we\u2019ll see a fairly significant dip in the short-term as we really transform that store.", "But in aggregate we\u2019ve seen in the neighborhood of about 5% disruption in 2009 and as we go into 2010 we\u2019re getting better and better at this remodel process and have already seen our ability to reduce that aggregate disruption below what we experienced last year. But you might see some varying levels, you will see varying levels of disruption depending upon what store you go in and at what point of that remodel. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "First question, it looks like the units per transaction were up nicely, about 1.3%, but the AUR was off about 0.7% in the quarter and I just would have thought with the mix and some of the increase in discretionary categories that you would have been seeing maybe a little bit more positive, so can you help me understand the decline in average unit retail and what\u2019s driving that. ", "Kathy Tesija", "Its really in a variety of categories and I think some of that is just lower retails where we have invested our cost savings into products. For example in kid\u2019s we have lowered our retails in kid\u2019s making it more affordable for our guests. ", "There\u2019s other categories like in our decorative home area or seasonal, less patio full sets and more casual seating which would lower the price point. And then there\u2019s areas like stationary where we\u2019ve added say $0.99 cards to our assortment just to offer a better opening price point as well as the high end Papyrus cards and so there\u2019s I think some shifting between good, better, and best that we\u2019re seeing and it varies, the reasons vary by category.", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The other thing that I would add is that there is starting to be a little bit of a mix impact due to P Fresh now that we have 200 stores. We are going to continue to see in those particular stores a greater unit sale and a less price per item and that particular impact in the first quarter, it wasn\u2019t significant but it would have shifted the overall numbers to be more closely aligned to being up slightly in terms of the units per transaction and essentially flat in terms of dollars, the amount of dollars per unit. ", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "And then I know there\u2019s some advertising mix shift going on here, 1Q to 2Q but if we look at 1Q it looks like your leverage per point of comp was about eight basis points of SG&A leverage per point of comp, is that something you think is a reasonable rate to think about and I guess another way of asking that would be where\u2019s the break-even leverage given just run rate cost increases and what\u2019s leverage look like above that. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well there are a lot of factors that go into any quarter so I don\u2019t like making the generalization out of any individual quarter\u2019s results, but looking across the year give or take our point of SG&A leverage is in the range of a two comp, perhaps a little lower. ", "So maybe we call that a one to two comp as the point of neutrality. And generally speaking this is a shorthand, all shorthand\u2019s ultimately break down at a detailed level, but generally speaking half of our expenses vary with sales, up or down from that point and half are fixed and so you can calculate the basis points from those figures. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ", "Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ", "Just a question on your comments around P Fresh and starting to see some cross shopping, I was just curious is that only in the stores that you remodeled this year or are you seeing it in the stores that you remodeled last year as well. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The primary increase is in the stores that we\u2019ve remodeled this year. Just to refresh your memory of the 108 stores that we remodeled last year, virtually all of them, the reconstruction in those stores were focused on expanding the food side of the business. As we rolled into 2010 we are focusing more completely on the entire store. ", "So the first two cycles of remodels that we just completed has the destination beauty, has home, has electronics, has video games, and some new visual elements throughout the stores and its in those stores that we\u2019re seeing the improvement in cross shopping. ", "Ultimately we\u2019ll go back to those stores that we remodeled last year and we will be adding those elements as well and we would expect to see improvements in cross shopping in those discretionary categories once we complete those elements as well. ", "But we\u2019re very encouraged. Now again it\u2019s a little early, we\u2019ve only got 96 stores that we\u2019ve completed in our first recycle this year but we\u2019ve seen a nice bump in those categories as we\u2019ve really focused on improving the experience and the visual impact and presentation in those stores. ", "Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ", "And then so I assume its too early to say it might have a greater impact on sales than you\u2019re originally thinking. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "No within our modeling we\u2019ve assumed all along that there was going to be a slight uptick in the discretionary spending. We laid that out for you in January, but it wasn\u2019t very modest. We were not expecting an uptick and what we have seen so far this year has been very consistent what our expectations were. ", "Doug Scovanner", "This is also the context here is everything. This is a quarter in which our overall chain wide sales of higher margin merchandise moved in line with the chain wide sales of lower margin merchandise. Just as our experience over time in new stores has shown us when the chain is doing well, newer stores end up reflecting an exaggerated version of what\u2019s happening in the chain.", "I think that our experience in P Fresh should be interpreted in that same context. ", "Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ", "There was some legislation I guess that got passed in the Senate last week regarding debit fee cuts, I know its early but is there any sense as to how that might help you. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well early is certainly the right word, that legislation has not passed the Senate. What you\u2019re referring to I believe is an amendment that passed that is attached to some proposed legislation that has not yet passed the Senate and the Bill that passed the House has no parallel feature in it. ", "Obviously we and all other retailers would benefit if that legislation were to pass given the hotly competitive nature of retailing in the United States. It is a virtual certainty in my mind that the vast majority of that benefit would be passed along to consumers, to our guests and customers of all other retailers.", "But it\u2019s a long way from being a law at this point even though it\u2019s a law that makes good sense to me from a public policy standpoint. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Congratulations on a fantastic quarter, in terms of the Kansas City test, are you seeing a greater frequency of visit from those cardholders in addition I would assume to a greater ticket and at what time would you decide to rollout the test further. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Most of the increase, substantially all of the increase is due to a higher frequency as opposed to a higher average ticket but nonetheless the increase is substantial enough to make it quite intriguing to consider relative to the fact that we are discounting sales that otherwise would have occurred in many sales that otherwise would have occurred at full price. ", "Its also comforting from an analytical standpoint to see that the pace of sales increase seems to be sustained. So we\u2019re not seeing any kind of drop off at all in year over year trends and now we\u2019re of course beyond six months into the test in both Kansas City and San Antonio. ", "Certainly we\u2019ll be carefully looking at these results here in the short-term and we will need to decide very soon whether we would want to do something on a much broader scale or alternatively other test markets because of the lead times involved to get something like that launched in time for the holiday season.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "And would you say that you\u2019re surprised in the difference in experience between the San Antonio and Kansas City markets. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well reasonable minds can differ on that one, that\u2019s after all why we produced two very different tests but in hindsight perhaps it sounds like common sense that 5% off every item every day at point of sale seems to be quite sufficient to ultimately overcome any perceptions about purchase price as it relates to behavior of guests in our stores and 3% for whatever reason does not move the needle nearly to the extent that 5% does. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "And then you mentioned I guess within a fairly short timeframe that all stores will have video games and TV wall, how should we think about the pace of rollout of destination beauty, home, and shoes in terms of reinvention, and why are the paces of rollout, why do they differ between the different reinventions. ", "Kathy Tesija", "So you\u2019re correct the video game and TV wall will all be installed by the end of June and the simplicity with that is that\u2019s its all contained within one area of the store so as that area is transitioning we will put that all in. Home and beauty are a little bit more disruptive.", "They are larger changes and more gondola movement and things like that and so that will happen with the P Fresh remodels so that the store is only disrupted once as they go through that remodel, they\u2019ll do all of the rest of it together. ", "And that would include the shoe reinvention which comes, starts in July in all remodels going forward. ", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "And I don\u2019t know if this question is necessarily the appropriate one to throw your way but I was in a lot of stores recently and during the tours the store managers and district team leaders have talked about store segmentation opportunities which I haven\u2019t heard in the past, is that just kind of a new terminology or a new opportunity, maybe you can elaborate on that. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "I think its more a terminology change than anything. We\u2019ve been micro marketing and trying to customize our assortments for many, many years and we have. I think as broadly as apparel and as narrowly as making sure that shovels are in northern climate stores and not in Florida or Texas. As we have applied new technology and become more sophisticated we have really evolved into a segmentation model where we\u2019re thinking more broadly about demographic, [cycle graphics], brands, and what is selling, urban markets, rural markets, and thing like that. ", "So it\u2019s a more holistic approach. This is a journey not a sprint. This is something that is going to take many, many years for us to really continue to refine and refine and refine but we\u2019re committed to it. We\u2019ve seen good results from our efforts thus far.", "And we believe it\u2019s the appropriate thing to do. As you know you go into, food is very localized so as you go into P Fresh remodels you\u2019ll see a food assortment that varies differently from Texas to San Antonio to Boston and that\u2019s part of that segmentation effort. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "Jeff Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray", "On new store growth, kind of just thinking ahead 2011 and beyond, any movement at all yet in the commercial development activities and/or anything else, any other visibility in terms of going into some urban markets that might change your growth trajectory and then just international, any updated thoughts on your plans and timing on that front. ", "Doug Scovanner", "I\u2019ll start with the store growth expectations and let Gregg address the international aspect of the question, no, our outlook has not changed and that means that this year we expect to open 13 gross, 10 net stores and we expect that this year 2010 will be the low point in our development activity but it will be a long, long time before we approach the kinds of development pace that was firmly in place here several years ago. ", "So, that translates to who knows 20 or more stores next year perhaps, maybe some more in 2012 but generally speaking the large scale retail development in this country remains at very near absolute zero and so we are left to self-develop individual store sites that make economic sense. ", "Gregg Steinhafel", "And regarding the question international, no new news to report there. Really we\u2019re doing the research and at some point in time we feel that we will be international but clearly in the near-term, in the zero to three, zero to five years, we\u2019re focused on really, the most important priority we have is really transforming our existing large base of general merchandise stores and making sure that P Fresh and all the related reinventions and the visual elements gets implemented through the 1300 stores that aren\u2019t super Targets, and so that is our highest priority right now and then as Doug mentioned we\u2019re going to continue to open new stores as we have in the trade areas that make sense, with the formats that we currently have. ", "And then three, we\u2019re looking at really trying to be more flexible with our prototype and take advantage of opportunities where there\u2019s great demographics and trade areas where our current formats simply just don\u2019t work because they\u2019re too large and we\u2019re looking at down sizing Target to fit the environment where there are guests that have lots of money and love Target and so we\u2019re focused on that as our third priority and then international would come well beyond that. ", "Doug Scovanner", "We have the capital to be able to grow much, much faster. We have the capabilities, team and otherwise to be able to grow much, much faster. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of trade areas in the US, maybe even more than a thousand that are suitable for Target stores that don\u2019t have one yet but this is all a matter of finding the right development opportunities that end up making economic sense to us, end up making sense on an overall basis in the communities we aspire to serve.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "Thinking about the improved sales and profits you\u2019ve seen lately across both retail and credit how has it looked on a regional basis across the country, specifically I\u2019m interested in maybe places like Florida, California, have behaved on this recovery versus the rest of the country. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well as you know in both of our segments those two states in particular declined a lot more than others. Our sales in Florida for example went soft well before our sales went soft in the rest of the country. California I would put an asterisk, it is certainly a state, but it behaves in large part like three different states, where the economy and our sales and our credit card experience in the Bay area is remarkably different from the economy and our sales and our credit card experience in the inland empire and central valley, the latter geography far more challenging than any other part of the state of California and as challenging as some of the most challenging geography that we\u2019ve operated in the country such as Las Vegas.", "At the moment trends in those areas are mixed candidly. Florida certainly has shown signs of stability and the beginnings of potentially of a recovery. The best I can say about some of those other geographies is they\u2019re not nearly as challenged as they were and aren\u2019t deteriorating, but by no means reflecting strength at this point.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s third quarter earnings release conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 17, 2010.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Target\u2019s 2010 third quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising.", "This morning I'll provide a high-level overview of our third quarter performance; then Kathee will share recent guest insights, discuss category results and describe our merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter and finally, Doug will provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Following Doug\u2019s remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.", "Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "We are pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflect strong performance in our core businesses as well as favorability in our third quarter income tax rate, which Doug will explain in a few minutes. ", "Our comparable store sales increased 1.6%, reflecting the lift from our remodel program; along with a modest comp increase net the underlying business. ", "Traffic continued to increase more than 2% in the third quarter even against the harder comparison presented by last years third quarter when traffic began to increase for the first time in 2009. Traffic has been healthy across the chain in 2010 particularly in our remodeled stores. And in the last two weeks of the quarter, both traffic and sales benefited from the launch of our new 5% REDCard Rewards Program, which is being enthusiastically embraced by our guests.", "Our sales continue to reflect the underlying economics challenges facing our guest resulting in volatility from week to week and across categories. We continue to enjoy strong sales in non-discretionary categories like food, healthcare and household commodities but we're also pleased with recent results in discretionary categories like beauty and women\u2019s apparel. These categories offer our guests a well-edited assortment of both fashion and basic items that combine compelling value, quality and style.  ", "Disciplined control of expenses has played a key role in our strong financial performance this year. Our teams are focused on smart expense control, maximizing opportunities to enhance productivity by eliminating non-value added work without compromising the guest experience. While this thinking is applied across the company, our stores teams continue to set the standard by consistently delivering meaningful productivity improvements while maintaining or improving guest service and reliability measures in our guest service. This is a testament to the leadership within our stores organization and to the dedication of our 300,000 store team members. ", "Our credit card segment continues to deliver outstanding performance both profit dollars and pre-tax returns in this segment more than doubled from a year ago. This performance was the result of superb execution in a very tough environment, particularly as we began to comply with new late fee regulations and of course, beyond profitability the credit card segment is completely integrated with our retail strategy providing the platform for our new REDCards Rewards Loyalty Program. While consumers remained conservative in their purchasing behavior, we're encouraged by recent finds in the broader economy that may signal somewhat stronger and more stable sales in the coming months. For example, job market statistics have improved in recent weeks. We believe that consumers regardless of their political views are relieved to have the uncertainties surrounding recent elections behind them and looking ahead, we believe that consumers would likely respond positively to a decision regarding the expiration of the Bush-Era tax cuts particularly if they were extended or made permanent.", "While some current signals are more positive, we continue to plan our business cautiously. We believe it's prudent to manage our expenses and inventories to accommodate a slow paced of economic recovery while continuing to innovate and pursue initiatives that drive top line growth. ", "In the third quarter, we opened 10 new stores completing our 2010 new store program. We also completed well over 100 remodels bringing our total for the year to 341, nearly four times the number we've completed in any other year in company history. Combining these projects with the PFresh stores we had in place at the beginning of the year we are now operating 462 general merchandise stores that incorporate the expanded food layout and in addition we have hundreds of locations reflecting our updated store designs in beauty, home, electronics, video games and shoes. While we expect to slowly ramp up new store growth in the next few years we don't plan to back off our ambitious program to update existing stores. ", "In 2011, we expect to set a new record by remodeling about 380 additional stores. Including approximately 20 new store projects, we expect to add about 400 additional locations that incorporate our precious thinking in store design, layout and presentation. And while we're very pleased with the execution of the 2010 remodel program we believe we can improve the process in 2011, meaningfully reducing the disruption experienced by our guests while helping our stores teams manage the process more efficiently. ", "As we look at our potential growth for beyond 2011, we're excited about the progress we've made in the development of a smaller format and we expect to have a few locations of this concept open in 2012. In addition, we're monitoring opportunities to open stores outside the 50 states focusing in the intermediate term on potential opportunities in Puerto Rico and Canada. And of course, we believe we have an opportunity to open hundreds of additional locations of our current formats in the United States. Conditions in the commercial real estate market have limited these opportunities in the short-term but we expect conditions to improve slowly in the next few years. ", "As I look ahead to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased with the foundation that has been built through the hard work of our teams this year. Our store base has never been in better condition and we've got two game changing strategies, PFresh and 5% Rewards that will drive our performance in the fourth quarter and for years to come.", "From conversations with many of you, I know there's a lot of enthusiasm about these programs and also that some of you still have questions about how these strategies will play out in result. I'm more confident than ever that these strategies will deliver incremental sales while maintaining our current, healthy retail-operating margin. However, beyond the financial value of these programs I'm excited because these initiatives are great for our guests, delivering both convenience and value. ", " ", "At Target, we constantly challenge ourselves to focus first on our guests, understanding their needs today while anticipating what they will want and need tomorrow. Both of these strategies are a reflection of this focus and the guest response confirms their relevance. ", "I want to thank the Target team for their unbelievable efforts that have put us in the strong position we're in today. I share their passion to ensure that Target continues to be our guests favorite shopping, one stop shopping destination with an unbeatable combination of fashion, quality, value and a great guest experience. I'm confident that this outstanding team will keep us at the forefront of retail for many years to come. ", "Now Kathee will provide detail on our guest insights research and merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter. Kathee?", "Kathee Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. During the third quarter our merchandising and marketing team has continued to innovate and drive initiatives to surprise and delight our guests. From game changing merchandising reinventions to our loyalty inspired 5%, REDCard Rewards Program and our distinctive Life's A Moving Target marketing campaign we continue to find new ways to remain relevant in our guests lives. One of the ways we stay connected to our guest is through a considerable investment of time and resources to help us understand their shifting attitudes and preferences creating insights into their evolving wants and needs. ", "Through these efforts, we know that guests continue to be very deliberate in their shopping behavior. The recession taught them to create and live within budgets and even as the economy improves, they continue to shop with a list. More recently, guests have started to put an occasional indulgence on that list. In those cases, they're willing to wait and save for the right item rather than settling for a substitute item at a lower price point. To feel good about these occasional indulgences guests focus intently on price and value in their everyday purchases. ", "Our third quarter results reflect these cross currents in the consumer environment. We continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store with meaningful gains in beauty, baby, apparel, toys, healthcare and of course, grocery. In fact mature sales in grocery continues to grow at a double-digit pace as guests are attracted to our quality and great prices particularly in our newly remodeled stores where guests tell us they love our expanded assortment. ", "Sales in Beauty have been strong all year. In both women's and men's apparel third quarter mature sales growth outpaced the overall company even though we faced tough prior year comparisons. Third quarter sales in Home were driven by seasonal categories as guests responded to our back-to-school and back-to-college offering. Third quarter electronic sales remained soft although in October we began to see improved results as guests responded to declining TV price points, new video game items like Xbox Connect, Red DSi and Wii systems and in entertainment which has become a very hit driven business, we saw great success with the new Taylor Swift album which includes tracks exclusive to Target. In its first week, this release sold more units than any other album in our history. These results demonstrate that even in a tough environment we continue to find new ways to satisfy our guest\u2019s wants and needs and deliver on our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise.", "As we move into the frenzy of the holiday season, we're continuing to focus on delighting our guests by offering compelling assortments and exceptional value. As always, we expect the season to be highly competitive and promotional so we're planning tremendous deals across every department throughout the season. And of course, every time a guest uses one of our REDCards they can receive an additional 5% off our already great prices. ", "This year\u2019s toy catalog features more toys than ever before and guests will be delighted to find even more discounts this holiday season. The catalog features 48 coupons, including 50% off top brands like Thomas & Friends, FurReal and TRIO Building systems by Fisher-Price. From popular Barbie Dolls to Zhu Zhu Pets, well-known Lego blocks to Nerf, there's something for every child on our guest shopping list this year. New this year to the storewide holiday catalog, a tear out kids insert allows parents to give kids their own catalog highlighting the items they care most about. Also, guests can scan the catalogs quick response codes with their Smartphone\u2019s and go directly online to further explore items of interest. Just one more innovative way Target is inspiring guests this holiday. ", "In apparel and accessories, designer partnerships continue to be an important part of our commitment to offering guests unique styles at affordable prices. This holiday season we'll share on trends fashions and accessories with guests through a number of exciting designer partnerships. We'll wrap up our very successful partnership with British luxury handbag designer, Mulberry at the end of the month. Through and up to December 26 guests can experience beautiful and distinctive jewelry from Temple St. Clair and beginning December 19 we'll round out our holiday assortment in apparel and accessories with the William Rast clothing line founded by American music star Justin Timberlake and his business partner, Trace Ayala.

Coupons will be available in Sunday's weekly ad to provide even greater value on hot holiday gifts. While our stores are closed for Thanksgiving, guests can get a jumpstart on their holiday deals during Target.com's exclusive one-day online Thanksgiving Day event where they'll find online only deals not available in the two days sale. We'll also be offering our biggest free shipping event ever covering more than 800,000 items from December 21 through December 11 when guests spend $50 or more on select items.

To find these authentic modern day Christmas carols, holiday tunes that reflect our lives as we live them right now, we reached out to more than 50 bands, big, small, independent and asked them to write a song to celebrate the joy of the season. We're pleased to be featuring the top tracks of our holiday campaign and we're offering them as free downloads to our guests on Target.com. Through it all, we wanted to demonstrate that we are uniquely equipped to help guests conquer the stress of the holiday season through our amazing prices, outstanding assortments and convenient and friendly shopping experience. ", "We're pleased with our performance through the first nine months of the year, believe our inventory is appropriately planned for the all important fourth quarter and are excited about the plans we have in place to drive our sales throughout the holiday season. As long as we continue to listen to our guests, make their lives easier, save them money and help them to indulge in small ways we believe we will continue to be their favorite place to shop, driving market share gains today and well into the future.  ", "Now, Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?", "Doug Scovanner", "Thanks, Kathee. In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter results by segment and on a consolidated basis. I'll discuss very early results from the national launch of our 5%, REDCards Rewards Program and I'll provide some color on our fourth quarter expectations. ", "As Gregg mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our business segments generated solid profitability and we continued to execute our share repurchased program at a robust pace. Our third quarter EPS of $0.74 was 28.5% ahead of last year\u2019s performance and included the benefit of a much lower income tax provision. Even without this benefit, our EPS growth rate was well into double-digits.", "In our retail segment, overall sales grew 3.0%, the results of the combined effect of 1.6% increase in comparable store sales and the contribution to our sales growth from new stores. Same store traffic or transaction count increased 2.1%, and was offset by a half point decline in average transaction size. ", "Net of remodeled related disruptions, our PFresh stores contributed about nine-tenths of a percentage point to our same store sales growth. In light of the October completion of this years remodel program today we operate 462 PFresh stores and together with our 251 Super Target stores, our guests now enjoy fresh food assortments in about 40% of the 1,752 stores in our chain. ", " ", "In the quarter our retail segment EBIT grew slightly faster than our overall sales, which led to our best third quarter EBIT margin rate in the past several years. As a reminder, the third quarter's our seasonally lowest quarter on this key measure of profitability. ", "There were no remarkable changes or issues to call out in gross margin or SG&A expenses in the quarter. More specifically the impact on ", "gross margin rate of sales mix was essentially neutral in the quarter. ", "Strong credit card segment performance continued in the quarter due to sequential improvement in many measures of risk including delinquencies and write-offs. These favorable trends led to a sharp reduction in the bad debt expense recorded in the quarter which was the biggest factor driving our increase in segment profit from $60 million last year to $130 million this year. We ended the quarter with an allowance of $775 million or 11.5% of receivables compared to $851 million or 12.2% of receivables at the beginning of the quarter. The majority of this $76 million reduction was the result of improving risks in the quarter with sequential declines in receivables making up the rest. ", "Beyond segment specific performance, we enjoyed an unusually low affective income tax rate in the third quarter as favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters increased our third quarter EPS by approximately $0.06. Our enterprise continues to generate far more cash than necessary to fund all of the capital we believe is appropriate to reinvest in our core business and to fund our dividend. As a note, we began trading X, our $0.25 dividend today. Strong cash generation together with an attractive share price allowed for another robust round of share repurchase in the third quarter. We acquired just over 15 million shares at an average price of $52.29 for a total investment of $793 million. In just nine months, we have repurchased more than 40 million of our shares representing more than 5% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. ", "Before I turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter I want to provide an early read on the results we've enjoyed since the mid-October national launch of our 5% REDCard Rewards Program. As you know, under this program guests who use either a Target credit card or a Target debit card received an immediate 5% off the point of sale. So far, the results are fully meeting our expectations. As expected issuance of credit and debit cards is sharply higher since the launch and usage of our cards measured as a percent of our sales, a statistic we call penetration has increased as well reversing a decade long trend in four short weeks. ", "As you see in today's press release, we've added a table to the retail segment page showing our REDCard penetration separately by credit and debit products. Specifically, through the first four weeks since the national launch our sales penetration on our cards has averaged about 1.3 percentage points above last year compared to the 0.4 percentage point decline we were running year-to-date through the second week of October. Based on our experience that nearly half of incremental card penetration represents incremental sales we continue to estimate that this program will drive about a percentage point of same store sales in the fourth quarter and between one and two full points in 2011.  ", "In Kansas City, you will recall that our sales lift was heavily concentrated among a subset of a 10% of Target guests who ring up nearly half of our sales. So far, it appears that a similar concentration is taking shape nationally. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter outlook. In our retail segment we continue to believe that our merchandising and marketing execution combined with the impacts of 5% REDCard Rewards and our remodel program will lead to an increase in the pace of our same store sales. For the quarter, we believe we are likely to enjoy growth in same store sales in the 2 to 4% range. By the way, we need to beat our first quarter 2010 performance of 2.8% on this metric to deliver on Gregg's press release quote this morning. We're further encouraged by our sales results through the first two weeks of November, which have run in the mid single-digits on a same store basis. ", "Overall, we expect to produce EBITDA and EBIT margin rates consistent with last years performance in the fourth quarter as we believe favorable leverage of SG&A and depreciation expenses will offset the gross margin rate declines associated with our two key sales building initiatives. In our credit card segment, we expect results to reflect trends you've seen so far this year although likely reflecting more moderate rates of improvement. We expect year-over-year receivables declines in the fourth quarter to be in line with our experience so far this year even with a small increment of premium FICO receivables resulting from the 5% REDCard Reward Program. The dollar value of expected write-offs should be consistent with our third quarter experience and again we'd expect our bad debt expense to be lower than write-offs, just how much lower will be determined largely by the degree of improvement in risks in our existing portfolio and to a lesser extent by seasonal dynamics. ", "Beyond the performance of our two segments we expect to continue to repurchase our shares, as what we believe will turn out in hindsight to have been highly attractive levels. The current median first call estimate for our fourth quarter earnings per share is a $1.38. Based on our expectations we believe this is a reasonable single point estimate within a range of possible outcomes. ", "Now, Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "", "We\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance and our momentum as we begin the fourth quarter. We're confident that our merchandising and marketing plans combined with our key growth driving initiatives will generate profitable, market share growth and target this holiday season. That concludes our prepared remarks.", "Now, Doug, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Hi. Good morning. The first question that I have is on the gross margin this quarter, can you maybe address why the mix has not been a detriment given the increased penetration from the PFresh stores?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Sure, we had better than expected performance in apparel and other higher margin categories throughout the month. ", "Doug Scovanner", "Bob, this has been consistent with our experience in the last couple of quarters as well. PFresh continues to contribute to our same stores sales growth but even that of the PFresh impact overall our sales mix has been a relatively neutral item in the makeup of our gross margin rate changes.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Got it and on the PFresh with the remodels complete, I guess one thing I'd be interested in hearing is the assortment editing that has gone on. What you really learned as you've rolled out the stores and with the remodels complete, like some of the fine-tuning that's going on within the assortments?", "Kathee Tesija", "Are you talking specifically food or around the whole store with the whole remodel?", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Mainly food but I'd love to hear any additional thoughts as well throughout the store?", "Kathee Tesija", "So, as you know our assortments are fairly segmented within food depending on the market we're going into. Of course, we expanded our food footprint across all areas of food adding the Fresh but as well as expanding from other categories like Dry, Dairy and frozen. And so we were able to bring in much more items across all of the food areas and we have segmented that by market where appropriate to local preferences. So we have learned a lot as we've gone along. Mostly I would say not any big revelation. I think I would qualify it more as tweaking, the fresh product is really the most wanted items on the guests list every week so those are pretty stable across all markets. ", "Where we get into specifics by market, whether that's snacks or just different items within dry, dairy or frozen that are specific to that market, we've seen different rates of sales maybe than we expected but not necessarily brands or items that we didn't anticipate. Throughout the rest of the store some of those areas we're shrinking of course to make room for food in those remodels and so we were decreasing assortment in those cases and for the most part I would say they correlated with it with some new presentation. For example in beauty, with Destination Beauty we were changing how we were presenting the product and editing at the same time. The same with home. The same with electronics and so within that we're now going back in and looking at productivity to make sure that we made the right choices and that we haven't eliminated skus by guests rally cared about but overall we feel very good about the assortments.  ", " ", "Doug Scovanner", "Just one quick add to Kathee's comment about the learning\u2019s and the food category. In aggregate we were dead right on the assortment but as she said the rate of sale was a little different than what we expected and so the big adjustment really has been about the number of facings that we have applied to the various items within the assortment, sometimes it was the presentation moving things from one part of the store to the other so we changed lead ins or what was on the back wall or what we stood for in terms of making a bigger impact in store levels so those were more of the adjustments that we made and it was really less about that assortment because we did a lot of research in advance market by market to make sure that we had a highly customized assortment.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with JPMorgan.", "", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning. On the month to date trends up mid single-digits can you elaborate on what's driving that relative to what you did in October? Is it a greater lift from PFresh, is it gains from the 5% or is the base business across the chain improving?", "Doug Scovanner", "We're a bit reluctant to get into mix and drivers in a period shorter than a month. The reason that I called that out is that even though we're halfway through the month of course it's much less than half of the month\u2019s sales because of the importance of what lies ahead but I thought it was useful to remark on the tone in the front end of the month. It's the first time in several years that the front end of November has been at all encouraging.", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "Okay. Fair enough and then just wondering, when you guys did the Kansas City test, how the sales list progressed out of the gate and are there any major changes today after you've rolled that out nationwide?", "Doug Scovanner", "Nothing major that's different in Kansas City and now nationwide. Of course, at the very beginning the sales lift was driven by increases in the frequency among existing cardholders. Over time as we issue more and more and more cards, as a result of the program, the mix of the incremental sales begins to be more and more influenced by new cardholders. Nationally we're only four weeks into the program of course, so we're still in the same position we were four weeks in Kansas City on these factors. Nationally the one difference is of course that we have a much larger marketing emphasis on this program than we had in Kansas City. So we're ahead of the Kansas City pace at this point. Impossible to know without some more passage of time whether that's simply a timing issue or whether we'll get farther along faster six, 12, 18 months down the road.", " ", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "Okay and my last question. On the PFresh remodels I was wondering if you could just quantify for us how the comp list progresses after you make the changes to the store? ", "Doug Scovanner", "Well almost instantaneously once we re-grand open that store we see an approximately 6% lift throughout the total store and based on what prior food print existed before the remodel we see anywhere from a 40% to 60% increase on the food side of it. So the guests respond rather quickly once we complete that remodel and re-grand open the store.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Over time we expect it to improve in the second and third year out we expect continuation of sales increases but to a much lesser extent and over a couple of year time frame we believe that and we fully expect to see potential around the 10% overall increase from Pre and post timeframe.  ", "Charles Grom - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict - Robert Baird", "Hey. Hi, guys. A couple of questions. First of all Doug, how much oft he 20 basis point reduction in gross margin rate in the third quarter can be attributed to the 5% off program? I recognize it was only in effect for a couple of weeks so it may not be material but any color on that and really what the expected impact would be for the fourth quarter as its in place for the full quarter?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well of course we're in a period right now Peter where we're not only incurring the full weight of 5% off every time the guest uses the REDCard but in addition we are experiencing the run off of the coupons issued under our prior 10% program so for a period of time we end up with both forms of discounting. To the heart of your question in the quarter this incremental year-over-year aggregate effect was less than 10 basis points so it truly is in the trivial category. Looking forward it'll be bigger than 10 basis points of course but we expect to favorably leverage SG&A expenses as a result of the incremental sales by pulling it back together at EBITDA and EBIT margins. ", "Peter Benedict - Robert Baird", "Okay. Good. That's helpful and then I understand the frequency amongst the existing cardholders is up given the new program? Has the basket changed at all with that increased frequency? Any more addition to the general merchandise part of the basket that you see or does that kind of come later?", "Doug Scovanner", "The basket, now we're talking about the incremental list in 5% rewards, not talking about PFresh?", "Peter Benedict - Robert Baird", "Right.", "Doug Scovanner", "The basket related to the net lift associated with the 5% Rewards program is reasonably similar to our overall basket. It is modestly lower in gross margin rate so directionally it's a little bit less rich but it is not even close to as different in it's characteristics as say the lift associated with PFresh. Directionally it's lower but not by a whole lot.", "Peter Benedict - Robert Baird", "All right. Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie with UBS.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on PFresh and just ask, you had obviously a little remodels during the third quarter, is the wave quantifying the disruption impact during the quarter?", "Doug Scovanner", "Just as we experienced in the first two quarters of the year the disruption was in the range of two or three tenths.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "Okay and in terms of the post remodel performance are you still seeing a combination of uplift in average basket and traffic when it comes to the remodels?", "Doug Scovanner", "No, the vast majority of the lift has been and remains traffic driven not average ticket driven.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "Great and although it's very early in the 5% REDCard Reward performance to see what the mix affect is but based on what you saw in Kansas City, in terms of how people are utilizing the card, would you say they are using it to buy more of the food items or was it more broadly spread across the store?", "Doug Scovanner", "As I remarked a minute ago it looks a lot more like the rest of the store at the margin. The incremental sales look a lot more like the rest of the store. Directionally somewhat lower, slightly lower in gross margin rate but not hugely lower as in PFresh.", "Neil Currie - UBS", "", "Thanks and just finally do you have any updates or comments on cotton inflation and labor inflation from China and how that might affect the fourth quarter and next year?", "Kathee Tesija", "No we don't see it impacting much of the fourth quarter at the total level. There are certainly some categories that were affected. Really this will be affecting 2011 starting in the first quarter and, as you know cotton prices are up considerably compared to last year. It really affects synthetic fabrics as well so it's across the board in apparel and of course soft home where we're experiencing cost increases.", "", "Neil Currie - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research", "Hi. Good morning.", "Doug Scovanner", "Good morning.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research", "I was wondering if I could ask about the core business veering away a bit from the impact of PFresh and 5% Rewards? Could you comment a little bit about how you see the performance of that business in the quarter? It looks like comps were just barely positive? How do you feel about that relative to what some of your competitors have produced? Is there anything that you think you might be doing that's not as successful as you'd like it to be or is there something you can tell us about the outlook for that business, excluding the impact of these two big programs?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well first on the numbers side of your question, we generated about a positive one excluding the impact of PFresh. Based on our disclosures, you can do that math obviously. And 5% Rewards was trivial in the quarter because it only impacted a couple of weeks and as I step back and look at positive one against our competitive sets paying careful attention to our sales mix I don't see perhaps the problem that you're seeing. Gregg?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, I would say overall we executed well against our Expect More, Pay Less strategy content or marketing were very relevant. This included what seems a long time ago our back-to-school and back-to-college businesses which were both fairly healthy. We've seen market share gains in virtually all of our frequency and consumable categories. Some of the outdoor decor, just discretionary parts of Halloween were soft but candy was strong. Apparel outpaced the store. Electronics and some of the entertainment categories were soft in that month although we've started to see both of those categories strengthen as we move through the quarter so overall we don't really see anything inconsistent with the strong execution of the strategy.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research", "Great. Thank you very much and good luck for holiday.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thanks.", "Doug Scovanner", "Thanks.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Co.", "Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Good morning. The question I had was around electronics. you mentioned the strengthening you're seeing there and I think it's been a fairly soft category for a good part of the year and I'm just curious as you look out for the holiday period, is this a category that you think can get back to positive territory on comps and if you're willing can you give us a rough idea of what percentage of your sales that represents during the fourth quarter?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes. Electronics has been difficult over the past couple of quarters. Due to a variety of issues in a number of large categories, which we're now starting to see turnaround as Doug mentioned. One of those is TV where last year we were up against the digital conversion and besides selling a lot of converter boxes we also were selling  a lot of digital TV's. That's now been improving as price points have been dropping and guests have been responding. So much stronger sales recently in that category. Video games is another very large category within electronics. That's in a very mature place. The hardware systems have been out for several years and earlier in the year there wasn't enough newness to create a lot of excitement but starting last month, we're starting to see that turn around with things like Xbox Connect, Black Ops released which was our largest release of all time so some help there. And then I would point to several new items that are really driving business up like the iPad, the new iPod, the Kindle so there is some momentum in electronics that we will think will carry through the fourth quarter.", "Doug Scovanner ", "In terms of your percentage of our business question, electronics is a subcomponent of what we disclose as the hard lines and in the case of electronics we're talking video games, hardware, software, music, movies, excuse me in the case of hard lines not only electronics but also music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods and toys. There's no, while our sales mix is different in the fourth quarter it's not different in any material sense in contributing to our financials. ", "Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay and then maybe just one follow-up, if you can give us a rough idea, what you might expect on the portfolio growth given your expectations around the 5% Rewards programs and the signups you're seeing?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well on a net basis we do not expect the program to grow measured and receivables. What we've said before is that the bigger macro factors, which have colored the declines in our receivables, are and will remain larger than any impact on our receivables from new cardholders. I will continue to expect our receivables will stabilize over the next couple of years in the range of five to $6 billion gross but that would clearly represent a decline not an increase from today\u2019s levels.", "Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Kathee, just wanted to follow-up on the inflation topic. It sounds as if you're bracing for those cost increases? Perhaps shred some light and some quantification on the magnitude of the cost increases and then what your plans are in terms of passing it along or absorbing some of those pressures?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes. We're still in the midst of that Adrianne. We've been working on sourcing for the first quarter but we're now working on second quarter and a lot of those programs and garments will be in stores for the full season so we need to look at them together so still a work in progress but cotton is up about 80% and synthetic fibers are up about 50 so some pretty hefty cost increases. I would say as that that translates into the garment there\u2019s a lot of things we can do to help mitigate that. Whether that's where it's produced or efficiencies within manufacturing and how we're cutting the fabric, using different fabrications. So we're going through the motions of making sure that right now we're designing the best apparels but at the same time with our eye on those cost increases and trying to mitigate that. And then I do think some of that will get passed on in higher retails where there warranted. We don't want to get to the place where we change the garment so much just to hit a price that they're not appealing. We will design them appropriate to what the guests want and make sure we charge accordingly.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Great and then maybe moving on to the food category. We're hearing some rumblings of inflation brewing there? Maybe of course as PFresh becomes a bigger component of your business what you\u2019re seeing on the food side and also the ability to pass along that inflation? ", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes. There are some issues coming in food in the way of corn and soybeans and of course that affects many different categories. All of the package, meat as well given the feed that they're fed and so there are many categories that are starting to look inflationary. ", "We've been in more of a deflationary mode in things like perishables and water so some of that will continue but I will tell you that most of it is inflationary at the moment and I think it's still to be determined what will happen in the marketplace in terms of retails. There's been slight movement but not a lot of movement yet.", "Doug Scovanner", "I'd be very careful in interpreting this whole discussion. We've been in a deflationary mode, relative modest deflation for a while. I think it's highly likely that the sign is changing in terms of the impact of inflation, deflation on our top line but I don't believe that translating all of this is going to move us into territory that is new or remarkably different in the aggregate. I think we're talking about fairly subtle changes and overall, not item by item but overall it's clearly our objective to try to preserve margin rates with the only caveat being that if the competitive landscape won't allow that we will certainly remain competitive and adjust appropriately.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. That's helpful Doug. And then Gregg, in your prepared remarks you had mentioned that as you're ramping up the remodels up to 380 next year looking to improve the process, reduce the disruption? Maybe give us some specifics in terms of ways you've done that, whether in terms of the time of remodel or what you're doing to improve the process that could help mitigate the disruption next year?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Sure. First thing we did, this year we had six cycles of remodels and next year even though we're going to have more stores we're only going to have four cycles. And we've timed those cycles to coincide with when there's not other category transitioning going on in the stores. So we're picking fewer and better times to disrupt the sales floor. We've shortened the cycle time of disruption on the sales floor. We're going to be better and smarter at sequencing the work that we do on the sales floor and then just being far more attentive to making sure we're providing better guest service and redirecting the guest to when categories shift in location from  one part of the store to the other. In some stores where we are not undertaking a major disruption, we call those a rightsizing. Those do not have much impact at all in the guest, the stores that are more disruptive are ones where we're really realigning the entire store and moving categories significantly from one end to the other. And we're just going to be a lot smarter having been through what we went through in 2010.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Great and my last question. Just as it relates to marketing, obviously some big initiatives, game-changing initiatives this year to spend behind. As we think about the fourth quarter, maybe help us think about that marketing spend year-over-year. Obviously the 5% is a bigger impact and maybe, Doug how do you think about next year in terms of marketing now as you're cycling some of the step up and spend? What does that line item look like? Thanks.", "Doug Scovanner", "", "Marketing hasn't moved materially in 2010 versus 2009 and I doubt that it will move much in 2011 versus 2010 all expressed as a percent of sales. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Yes. So, I mean it's up slightly in the fourth quarter and we continue to adjust and shift the promotional dollars within the large marketing budget. Clearly right now we have a very strong emphasis on holiday and our 5% Rewards and as we transition into the new year we will continue those same emphasis on storewide events and PFresh but again we will remix based on what\u2019s appropriate in each of the timeframes that we're evolving through.", "Doug Scovanner", "And retime during the year. This is a much bigger issue quarter over quarter but I couldn't begin to guess which quarters will be adverse and which ones will benefit '11 versus '10.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Best of luck. ", "Doug Scovanner", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Grant Nelik with ISI.", "Grant Nelik - ISI", "Hi, thanks. Really two areas that I want to talk about SG&A and CapEx. Doug, first on the CapEx side with 20 new stores next year and the remodels hopefully getting a little cheaper but being very effective what should we be budgeting for next year?", "Doug Scovanner", "At this point, this year I would say we're narrowing into a fairly tight range around $2 billion plus or minus and that's up several hundred million from last year. I think in sequence next year yet again will be up several hundred million but I need a little wider range around that. Half or more of the capital for the new stores is invested prior to the year of opening so one of the big drivers this year is that next year's store count in terms of new stores is bigger than this years store openings. But generally speaking a nice round number would be 2.5 billion plus or minus a fairly wide range next year versus two billion plus or minus a tight range this year. ", "Grant Nelik - ISI", "Got it and then given the sales do seem to be coming in better than expected, at least early in the quarter? I remember last quarter you guys talked about buying into a pretty conservative comp and hoping it was better? It seems like its better. How do you feel on the inventory situation and trying to maybe get some more inventory in the stores in the next month?", "Doug Scovanner", "At the moment we're in fine shape from an inventory standpoint.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "And philosophically our position hasn\u2019t changed and we're within six weeks of Christmas. There isn't a whole heck of a lot we can do from an inventory standpoint except in those very short cycle businesses which all along we've been committed to be in the 99% in stock range and so as those businesses fluctuate we just buy more or less but the longer cycle import oriented business we're locked in for the fourth quarter and it's about selling through our ownership.", "Grant Nelik - ISI", "And in SG&A dollars last year the fourth quarter was when we grew over 4%. Given that that's your easiest comparison is it possible that SG&A dollars could actually be flat or down in the fourth quarter or given the sales they should probably creep up?", "Doug Scovanner", "", "It all hangs in the balance of the sales but no matter which way it plays out I would expect in SG&A rate terms to see some meaningful year-over-year progress.", "Grant Nelik - ISI", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Doug Scovanner ", "", "Thanks ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America", "Thanks. Hey, Kathee actually just a quick question for you. I think you mentioned something about the customers maybe doing a little more impulse shopping? Can you comment on whether you're actually seeing signs of customers trading up specifically within categories and also maybe related to that are you seeing any relative momentum changes in customer trends say through the third quarter by income demographic or any other ways you measure that that could maybe shed some light for us on the tone or change of what's going on out there? Thanks.", "Kathee Tesija", "Robby, I would say that what we're seeing in the third quarter is a bit of a continuation of what we talked about a little bit in the second quarter and that's that guests are still cautious. They're shopping from their list but at the same time they're looking for great value, which Target offers in many different categories. So in some cases, beauty, they're buying beauty at Target versus other places and while even though they might be buying more expensive items within beauty, like skin care, it's much cheaper than perhaps what they were buying before so it's a great value in their minds. Things like C9 and apparel where still could be looked at a spend a discretionary item yet given the marketplace and the other brands that the could buy, C9 is an incredible value. So I would tell you that we're seeing that across the store. I can give you examples. I gave you one in apparel. In home I would tell you the trend to stay at home and cook. We're seeing some strength in the higher end brands like kitchen essentials by Calphalon so we're really seeing it across the store in many different categories but I will tell you that guests are just being selective but they are investing when it's something they really want.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "Good morning. Doug, just want to check in and make sure that your leverage point is still in the 1 to 2% range and also just want to see what the additional opportunities are in terms of SG&A?", "Doug Scovanner", "Well generally yes our leverage point has not changed. We have at different points in time characterized that as either lying in the 1 to 2% range or closer to 2%. That of course is an annualized comment. It certainly isn't going to be true each and every quarter. Three really aren\u2019t any fundamental changes here to talk about other than the facility that once we begin enjoying both the full benefits of PFresh and 5% Rewards here in this quarter we would expect to get our sale lift up above that leverage point and therefore produce some beneficial leverage as a percent of sales that in margin terms should offset the deterioration in gross margin rate due to sales mix on the PFresh side and due to the markdowns or discounts on the 5% Rewards side.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "Great and then where are you right now in terms of self-distribution of food?", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Our food supply chain is a highbred and over time we continue to take more and more control so we have a combination right now where we do food distribution through CNS on the coast. We control the supply chain on our own through the center part of the country. We still do some food distribution through Super Value although that is winding down over the next couple of years. So it will be a combination of Target and CNS as we look out of the next two to four years. ", "", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "And then based on the success of the Harlem store? I think there were collections that were specific to that store? Will you be doing more localization at that level going forward?", "Kathee Tesija", "Some of that collection was in other stores as well and we do look for opportunities where we can segment and some of our designer don't go into all stores. They're into smaller, 250 up to about 1,500 depending on the program. So I wouldn\u2019t' say we're looking to do a lot more but certainly when we have some of the great designers who have come to us like we have in Harlem, we would love to add that into our mix.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "And Kathee, on the food side as you guys have gained more experience have you also tailored food at a more granular level as well?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes we segment food. The most segmented areas of our store actually because as of the local brands and flavor profiles there is a lot of segmentation throughout all of food.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "Well, great. Thanks so much and best of luck this holiday season.", "Kathee Tesija", "Thanks.", "Doug Scovanner", "Thank you very much. We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Our final question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "Thanks. Just a quick follow-up Doug. In terms of the REDCard knowing that most of the lift now is from existing cardholders, as that transitions to new cardholders and may be based potentially on your experience in Kansas City what is the primary tender that displayed? Is it credit, debit, what kind of credit and if you could loop into your answer some comments on how you're thinking about ", "the Durbin impact in the next year as well?", "Doug Scovanner", "Based on our experience in Kansas City the program will build throughout 2011 nationally and that's what should take us from the more or less 1% beneficial impact here in Q4 to something well into the range of 1 to 2% annualizing probably at closer to 2% by the end of the year. Clearly we're displacing other forms of plastic payment but of course there are both seasonal factors and secular, longer-term factors at play here. The business is moving at the margin away from credit and towards debit so generally speaking this is a little bit more precise than we can actually measure but generally speaking guests who want to use credit are going to use credit whether it's ours or someone else's and similarly for debit. ", "On the Durbin side who knows where that's going. One of the banks of course has filed a lawsuit to try to stop implementation. I think that given the competitiveness nature of retail whatever the benefit might turn out to be to us and to our principal competitors is highly likely to be passed along to our guests in the form of lower pricing. I doubt very seriously that you'll see any meaningful impact on retailer EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as a result of the Durbin amendment.  ", " ", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "And if I could just follow-up with one question for Kathee. You know the home category continues to be relatively sluggish for you especially relative to some of the more pure play retailers? Any thoughts there on what's different in your guest or in your merchandise versus what we're seeing elsewhere? ", "Kathee Tesija", "You know, home has been strengthening over the past year but I would say that it's been selective to categories that really fit our family\u2019s lifestyles. So I mentioned cooking and food preparation a minute ago. I think with families eating at home more, we're seeing categories like that that are starting to come back. Things like the seasonal area have been very strong for us because guests are entertaining at home. They typically have small children. They're having parties or events at home so we're seeing strength there. ", "I think where we've struggled to turn the business around the most is some of the more decorative businesses or  the domestics area, which again has been improving but not to the level of say apparel, what we've experienced on the apparel side so still far more discretionary even than apparel when you compare the two and I just think that's lagging as our guest is making their budget and trying to stick with it. Some of the home products are just the most discretionary and they can go without them right now.", "Colin McGranahan - Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thank you. Good luck with the holidays.", "Kathee Tesija", "Thank you.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thank you very much. That concludes Targets third quarter earnings conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corp.'s Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Good morning, and welcome to our 2010 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, along with our priorities as we enter 2011, then Kathy will discuss our fourth quarter category results, share recent guest insights and highlight initiatives for 2011. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our 2010 financial results, our outlook for 2011 and our longer-term growth expectations. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "We're very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year financial results we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.45 were above our expectations, resulting from solid performance in the Retail segment, unexpected strength in the Credit Card segment and favorability in our income tax rate. Our full year earnings per share increased 21.4% over 2009, reflecting strong results in both business segments, along with the impact of a robust share repurchase program. ", "In our Retail segment, the pattern of our fourth quarter sales was far more volatile than expected as consumers retimed their holiday gift purchases weather across the country drove dramatic swings in our daily sales. Traffic remained strong in the fourth quarter, up 1.6% on top of the robust 2% traffic increase we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "Our Credit Card segment continues to generate strong results due to disciplined execution and underwriting, as well as improving consumer balance sheets. Beyond the profit this segment generates for Target, it creates much more value through its integration with our retail strategy. Most recently, as the platform for our 5% REDcards Rewards initiative. Our REDcards are helping to deepen our relationship with our better and best retail guests. ", "As we pursue a potential transaction, sell the receivables assets created by this segment, a key priority will be to preserve the valuable integration of our card offering with our overall retail strategy and brand. In addition, we're committed to maintaining our card operations, including all aspects of the interaction between our team members and our guests. ", "Beyond the performance of our business segments, fourth quarter and full-year financial results benefited from our robust share repurchase program and favorability in our income tax rate. Going forward, we believe we will continue to have ample excess capital to devote to opportunistic share repurchase without adversely affecting our credit ratings after we funded strategically and financially appropriate investments in our core business. ", "As we enter 2011, we're focused on driving results in the near term while we continue to invest in initiatives that will sustain our future performance. To ensure successful performance today, our merchants are focused on creating newness and excitement, staying reliably in stock on basic and commodity items and delivering outstanding value through our assortments. And as always, our stores' teams continue to focus on appropriately controlling expenses while delivering a superior guest experience. Our goal, both today and in the future, is to be our guest's favorite place to shop. ", "We have several transformational strategic initiatives that will position Target for success over time, namely, we continue to remodel our existing stores to deliver an optimal merchandise mix along with a great experience. After a record 341 PFresh remodels in 2010, we expect to set another record this year by remodeling approximately 380 more stores. Consistent with last year's remodels, our 2011 projects will expand our assortment of dry, dairy and frozen foods at a thoughtfully-edited assortment of the best-selling perishable items and incorporate reinventions in other areas of the store, including home, apparel, beauty, shoes and baby. In addition, when we're making these merchandise changes, we also update visual elements and refresh every part of the store. ", "The under existing store base we continue to add locations in the United States when they meet our strategic and financial criteria. In 2011, we plan to open six new stores in March and another 15 locations in the second and third quarters. We continue to develop our plans for a small urban format called City Target, and we expect to open pilot locations in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco in 2012. If successful, this format will provide us more flexibility to operate in densely populated areas on sites that won't accommodate our larger store formats. And as we announced last month, we're excited about our plans to open between 100 and 150 Canadian Target stores in 2013 and 2014 as a result of our acquisition of leasehold interests in Zellers sites. This transaction gives us access to key locations and markets throughout Canada and will allow us to achieve an efficient scale in a very short period. We believe that the addition of Canada provides Target with better potential to grow sales and earnings per share to higher absolute levels several years out than we would have otherwise. ", "Beyond physical stores, we're investing in target.com to ensure that we deliver our Target brand experience anywhere, any time for our guests. We expect to launch our own platform for target.com in the third quarter, marking the end of our multi-year partnership with Amazon.com. This project is on track and portions of the new platform have already launched, including order management and fulfillment. This new platform will completely transform the online experience for our guests, driving traffic and sales by serving as the platform for our multi-channel initiatives. ", "And finally, we expect our new 5% REDcard Rewards program will continue to deliver incremental sales and traffic in 2011. Nationwide since last October's launch, active new accounts are running almost 4x ahead of prior year, and new REDcard guests are shopping more often and spending more at Target. In Kansas City, where we launched this program in October of 2009, we continue to enjoy strong increases in REDcard penetration in year two as more and more new REDcard guests sustain their higher level of engagement, a good indicator of the program's strength in creating deeper guest loyalty. ", "These are some of the strategic initiatives that we believe will create value both today and well into the future. With the addition of Canada, our growth plans anticipate that Target sales will exceed $100 billion in the next six to seven years, and we believe that we can at least double our earnings per share over that same time period. Our teams are energized and eager to make each of these initiatives a success. ", "While we're very excited about our plans to expand in Canada, we remain focused on thoughtful, disciplined execution of our strategy here in the United States. Because of our decade-long focus on recruiting, developing and retaining strong leaders, we have a wealth of talent at Target that will ensure we deliver on all of our initiatives around the world. ", "I want to thank our great team for all of the work they've done to deliver strong financial results in 2010 and for the energy they devote everyday to making our future plans a reality. Now, Kathy will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline key initiatives for 2011.", "Kathryn Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. In many ways, the fourth quarter was a lot like the rest of the year with times of surprising strengths followed by unexpected sales softness. We believe this pattern is indicative of a new economic reality in which consumers think and behave differently than they have in the past. We believe we're well positioned to continue to thrive in this new world because of our strong brand, loyal guests and our singular focus on deepening the relationship with our guests. ", "As Gregg mentioned, the pattern of our sales in the holiday season was more volatile than expected. November sales and traffic were quite strong as favorable weather drove apparel sales and guests responded to holiday promotions like our pre- and post-Thanksgiving events in the final week. We now believe that some of these sales were pulled forward from later in the season as we experienced a meaningful slowdown in sales and traffic in the first half of December, most notably in gift-giving categories like toys, electronics and housewares. The last two weeks of December strengthened once again as guests responded to our differentiated assortment and the one-stop shopping convenience provided by our stores. ", "As we've noted in prior conference calls, today's consumer is focused on value, and this was clearly evident this past holiday season. Not only did promotions affect the timing of sales within the quarter, a higher-than-expected percent of overall holiday sales were from items on promotion. We offset this pressure through our ongoing efforts to increase gross margin within categories, meaning that the year-over-year reduction in our fourth quarter gross margin rate was entirely driven by our PFresh remodel program and REDcard Rewards. ", "Following a pullback in the second and third quarters, consumer optimism is once again increasing and close to where it was in the first quarter of 2010. Even so, guests are telling us that they are still risk-averse. They're concerned about losing their jobs and focused on controlling household budgets, leading to increased coupon use and a focus on promotions. For everyday purchases, guests often choose the good items rather than the better or best items within categories. In turn, they use those everyday savings as justification to occasionally splurge on the best items in categories most important to them. This has created softness on better items in some categories, making it more important than ever for us to help our guests understand features, quality and value at every price point. ", "As we turn to 2011, we're working to provide the right assortment, great quality and low prices while delivering the excitement and newness our guests love. We continue to differentiate with our own brands, from value brands like up & up and Room Essentials, all the way to our upscale Smith & Hawken brand. In addition to our store collection, we've introduced an expanded assortment from this iconic brand on target.com, offering the highest quality garden and home products, including expertly-crafted teak patio furniture, copper pots and solid-forged gardening tools. The relaunched assortment incorporates many of Smith & Hawken's original designs, offering the highest quality at amazing prices. ", "We continue to offer limited-time programs that create newness and encourage our guests to explore our store. We recently completed the Great Save event, in which we offered great prices on bulk packaged stock-up items in a club setting with no fees. For the second year in a row, we saw great results with this limited-time program. ", "In 2011, we'll continue to create excitement and differentiate our assortment by offering limited-time collections from great brands and designers. In apparel, beginning in March, Target is celebrating the five-year anniversary of our fashion-forward and affordably-priced Go International program, with the Blockbuster Collection featuring 34 dresses from 17 past Go International designers. Guests will be excited to have a second chance to find the most coveted pieces from past Go collections and will have a unique opportunity to find all of these acclaimed designers and affordable looks together for a limited time. ", "Just in time for Easter, Target is launching a line of Godiva chocolates beginning March 13, featuring an Easter bunny and a collection of ice cream parlor-themed items. Prices on these delicious items will be amazingly affordable, ranging from $3 to $10. And beginning May 1, Target is partnering with Calypso St. Barth, a brand which has grown from a small resort wear line to a luxury lifestyle brand with 26 boutiques across the United States, St. Barts and Paris. Calypso St. Barth for Target features apparel and accessories for women, girls and babies, as well as home goods such as candles, decorative pillows, dinnerware, glassware and serving pieces. Prices for this collection will range from $2 to $80 and will be available in most Target stores and on target.com. ", "This spring in electronics, we're rolling out Target Mobile Kiosks and the electronics trade-in program to an additional 600 locations, bringing the total to approximately 1,450 stores by June. These kiosks provide guests the opportunity to work with a trained expert who can assist them with the purchase of cellphones and data plans from the nation's largest carriers. The kiosks also allow stores to offer a trade-in program that provides store credit usable for any Target purchase in exchange for used and working video games, cellphones, iPods and MP3 players. ", "In gaming, we're excited about the new Nintendo 3DS system coming this March. This is the first Nintendo release since the launch of the Wii system in 2006. This system will retail for $249.99 nationwide, and as always, guests who use their Target REDcard will save 5% on a Nintendo 3DS purchase, along with almost everything else sold in our stores and online. ", "This spring, we're launching a blue and white theme across multiple divisions and brands in Home, creating a differentiated and trend-forward look across our Home area. As part of this initiative, our in-house design team has created unique exclusive products for both our Room Essentials and Target Home brands, which will be presented in unique and compelling displays both on end cap and in line. We're partnering with Sabrina Soto, our Home Design expert, to educate guests on how individual items can be incorporated into existing looks, allowing them to refresh their homes without breaking their budgets. ", "As Gregg mentioned earlier, in 2011, we're continuing our ambitious effort to update our store base. Our 2011 remodels will incorporate all of the merchandising innovations from the 2010 program, including grocery, home, apparel, beauty and shoes. And later this spring, we'll add the Newborn/Infant/Toddler area to that list. We began testing this newest innovation in a small number of stores in July 2010. In these test stores, we removed the visual barrier between baby apparel and the gear and furniture area to facilitate cross-shopping. We created a new sleeping destination including cribs, bedding and accessories with larger floor-level displays. We moved all apparel on to the hanging floor pad, and we created a car seat and gear shop that's easier for guests to navigate. ", "Guests in these stores told us that the shopping experience was better, more integrated, intuitive and easy to shop. Based on this feedback and the financial performance of the test, we will begin incorporating this innovation into remodels that launch this March, and by year end, we expect to have it in more than 300 store locations. ", "Beyond our stores, we're investing in our online and mobile capabilities as well. At Target, cross-channel shopping, in which guests engage with us both in-store and online, is growing faster than either distinct channel. One of the primary enablers of cross-shopping is mobile phones. Mobile phone traffic at target.com increased nearly three-fold in 2010 and accounted for 8% of our online page views. We will continue investing to keep Target at the forefront of mobile retailing, and we're pleased that we were recognized by Mobile Commerce Daily as the 2010 Mobile Retailer of the Year. ", "Target.com had a great holiday season, growing faster than online industry sales due to increases in traffic, conversion and average order value. Our expanded free shipping offer played a major role in this performance as we expanded the offer to 950,000 items on orders over $50. And our target.com team is on their way to launching the complete reinvention of the website this fall. This new platform will place a premium on guest experience and will feature greater personalization, expert advice, navigation, product detail and a much more compelling visual content. ", "Before I turn it over to Doug, I want to comment on our efforts to mitigate the impact of commodity cost inflation. While cotton inflation gets the headlines, we're also seeing cost pressures in other fabrics along with food and other parts of our store. Our goal is to maintain our gross margin rates within categories by addressing cost pressures in a variety of ways. For example, we've performed research to determine which garment features are important to our guests and applied these insights to the product design and development phase to ensure we deliver quality garments with features that add value for our guests. ", "To our raw material strategy, we've standardized fabrics across multiple items and categories, allowing those to achieve greater scale and drive production costs down. And we're optimizing pricing and promotional plans within categories. While these efforts will mitigate some of the impact, in some cases, we will need to raise prices to offset higher costs. We will be thoughtful and strategic when making these changes, and we'll monitor the marketplace to ensure we continue to provide outstanding value. ", "Our focus on our guests is unwavering. We strive to stay ahead of her with an unbeatable combination of brands, exceptional quality and value and the ability to deliver a great experience and surprise her on every visit, both in-store and online. We're confident that this focus will create delighted guests and strong performance in the year ahead and well into the future. Now, Doug will cover our fourth quarter and 2010 financial performance and provide details on our outlook for 2011 and beyond. Doug?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results. Then I'll provide a view of our 2011 outlook for each of our business segments, including our new Canadian Retail segment. And I'll wrap up with a discussion of our objective to grow sales to $100 billion or more and to at least double our earnings per share over the next six or seven years. ", "For the fourth quarter and full year, we produced EPS growth of 17.0% and 21.4% respectively, both of which exceeded our expectations. Our annual EPS of $4 eclipsed our previous record annual EPS performance by 20%. As a reminder, exactly a year ago, we outlined our plans for 2010 that supported our belief that the then current First Call median EPS estimate of $3.62 seemed like a reasonable single point estimate. Our actual performance exceeded this figure by $0.24 per share, excluding the net favorable discrete income tax items that added just over $100 million or another $0.14 of EPS to our results. ", "For the year just ended in our Retail segment, we met the sales and EBIT objectives we outlined at that time. In our Credit Card segment, we far exceeded them. Additionally for the quarter and year, EPS also benefited from robust execution of our share repurchase program. We invested almost $2.5 billion in repurchase of our shares during the year, and net of stock plan issuance, we reduced our shares outstanding by 40.6 million or 5.5%. In fact, we returned just over 100% of our net income to shareholders this year through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. ", "Our return on equity or ROE, derived by dividing our net income by beginning of year total shareholders investment, was a strong 19.0%. In 2011, we expect our shareholders will enjoy their 40th consecutive increase in annual dividends. ", "In our Retail segment for the quarter and full year, our sales were boosted by our two key growth strategies: PFresh remodels and the October national launch of 5% rewards. As expected, our Retail segment operating margins remained very strong, replicating EBITDA and EBIT margin rate performance for the quarter and year in line with our record 2009 performance. As I've observed many times, the key to future prosperity in our Retail segment is to rejuvenate our sales growth while generally maintaining our premier EBITDA and EBIT margin rates. ", "Fourth quarter penetration of our sales on our REDcards, our internal credit and debit products, was 1.8 percentage points higher than last year, precisely in line with our expectations for the period and representing the first significant increase in nearly a decade. So far, our national experience is a near-perfect replica of our earlier Kansas City test market experience in all material respects. ", "Our Credit Card segment continues to deliver superior results, far exceeding our expectations for the quarter and for the year. Our segment profit of $541 million for the year was $340 million or 169% better than the $201 million we earned in 2009. This drove the pretax return on the $2.8 billion of capital Target has invested in these assets to a record 19.5% for the year. Key measures of risks, including trends and delinquencies and trends in dollar-weighted portfolio FICO scores, continue to migrate swiftly in the right direction. ", "Now let's turn to our outlook for 2011. In our U.S. Retail segment, we continue to expect that our remodel program and 5% rewards will each contribute significantly to our comparable store sales growth, against the backdrop of persistently weak overall market growth in the U.S. for the kinds of goods we sell. In the case of PFresh, we expect this favorable contribution, net of the adverse impact of remodel disruption, to grow to a run rate of about 1.5 percentage points as we progress through the year. ", "Separately, we expect our 5% rewards program will grow more rapidly in its importance, possibly adding close to two percentage points to our same-store sales growth later in the year. Combined with an expectation that our base sales growth would remain slightly positive, this adds up to an expectation of a 4% to 5% increase in comparable store sales for the year. Obviously, this is well above our current experience and above any overall same-store sales growth we've experienced in quite a while. So if it were to unfold for the year, we clearly would expect stronger growth in the fall than in the spring. ", "Our forecast envisions essentially flat retail EBIT margin rates for the year as the decline in the Retail gross margin rate is expected to be offset by favorable leverage on both the SG&A and depreciation and amortization expense lines. Importantly, this offsetting balance for the year is unlikely to occur in the spring season and especially in the first quarter as we cycle against the strongest quarterly EBITDA and EBIT margin rate performance achieved in our modern history. In other words, given all that we know and expect regarding sales growth and timing matters, today, we would envision modest pressure on our Retail EBIT margin rate in the spring and modest favorability on this measure in the fall. ", "We expect to invest about $2.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, in capital in the U.S. Retail segment in 2011, up modestly from the $2.1 billion we invested in 2010. This increase is driven in part by a larger remodel program and in part by modestly higher investment in future new stores as well. In our Credit Card segment, we expect receivables will continue to decline, although the pace of decline should begin to moderate as the year progresses. ", "Measures of our rate of profitability should remain very strong for the foreseeable future. In this segment, we've begun the process of identifying the right strategic partner to purchase our assets, fund our operations going forward and most importantly, to work together with us to optimize portfolio performance metrics while continuing to deliver credit products that exemplify our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. We'll update you from time to time when we have something to add. And at this point, I would only observe that we're pursuing a transaction that would remove the receivables assets from our balance sheet, preserve the integration of our card offering with our retail strategy and maintain our card operations, including all guest contact touch points. This process will most likely take several quarters to unfold, such that if a closing were to occur, we would expect to achieve it late in 2011 or early in 2012. The kind of transaction we have in mind, if closed, would produce a gain on sale, followed by an expected sharing in the robust economics this overall portfolio is likely to continue to produce over time. ", "Now let's turn our attention to our Canadian market entry and the effect it will have on our financial statements in 2011, specifically looking at our Canadian Retail business segment, the results of which will be segregated from our other segments beginning with the current quarter. As you know, we've agreed to pay a little over CAD $1.8 billion to control the destiny of up to 220 valuable leaseholds for space currently occupied as Zellers stores, and which will continue to be operated by Zellers for quite some time. We'll invest this capital in two separate closings in 2011, one in our second quarter and one in our third quarter. ", "We're currently deeply into a process involving scores of discussions with individual landlords to determine which leases we might want to assume and in partnership with our new landlords, invest all the capital necessary to convert into new Target stores. We're also considering which leases we might want to turn back to the landlords, which leases might be assigned to other retailers and which ones will ultimately remain as Zellers stores. Coming out of this process, we continue to expect to open 100 to 150 Target stores primarily in 2013. ", "Even though these dynamics are quite fluid at this time, I can share some detail surrounding the effects of our Canadian market entry will have on our 2011 financial results. There will be two direct effects and one important indirect effect. The direct effects will result from accounting, for SG&A expenses and from accounting for all aspects of the leases we elect to assume. The indirect effect is that our investment in Canada will cause us to slow down the execution of our share repurchase program in the short term. The primary SG&A components will include the portion of IT development costs that are expensed not capitalized and the compensation and benefits of the Target team members tasked with planning and executing this exciting market entry. ", "Separately, we'll begin to amortize the aggregate CAD $1.8 billion allocated to individual leases, primarily on buildings that we intend to convert to Target stores, and we'll begin to recognize interest expense and depreciation on leases for these sites that are capitalized. These lease costs will be partially offset by sub-lease income. Overall, SG&A and lease-related direct costs might add up to an EPS equivalent in the range of $0.10 for the year, an estimate that will surely continue to evolve as the year progresses. ", "GAAP requires that we recognize these expenses in 2011, even though they're in a very literal sense, important investments that will drive strong sales growth and strong EBIT growth in 2013 and beyond. Also as a reminder, if we were to assume any leases that were later assigned to other retailers or sold to landlords, there could be gains or losses recorded at that time. ", "Separately, the slower pace of share repurchase will cause modestly slow EPS growth in 2011, perhaps in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share, depending on the assumptions you might use. Combined with Canada-related expenses, this means that our best current estimate is that the aggregate effects of our 2013 market entry will create a $0.15 to $0.20 headwind on 2011 EPS. ", "With this in mind, let's turn to our outlook for aggregate 2011 EPS growth. We actually earned $3.86 per share in 2010, excluding the $0.14 impact of the income tax items we previously discussed. Net of all effects of our Canadian market entry, we still expect to be able to grow EPS from our tax-adjusted 2010 results into a range approaching or perhaps exceeding 10% year-over-year growth. Given its near term diluted impact, why are we so excited about our transaction in Canada? The explanation is quite straightforward. We strongly believe that several years out, Target's sales and EPS will be higher and our long-term growth prospects stronger with this transaction than they would be without it and instead bought back yet more shares. ", "As Gregg said earlier, with this transaction, we expect to exceed $100 billion in sales in the next six to seven years, and we believe our EPS will at least double in that same time period. This means we believe that our execution of our core growth strategy in North America will cause EPS to grow over the next six or seven years at a compound annual rate of at least 10% to 12% per year, achieving annual EPS of $8 or more by 2016 or 2017. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're very pleased with our 2010 results, and we're energetically pursuing transformational initiatives that will drive performance in every part of our business. With a great team, millions of loyal guests and one of the strongest brands in retail, we're prepared to thrive in 2011 and for many years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Question on the sale of the Credit Card. I was wondering if you could just talk about what some of the benefits are that you expect from selling it? You've talked about how profitable it was and how it's exceeded expectations. So can you just clarify for us why you think now is a good time to sell that business? And then is that -- should we assume that, that is necessarily going to be a dilutive transaction?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Lot of different issues wrapped up in that series of questions. Let me see if I can address all of them and follow-up if I missed one or two. Regarding your timing question, we think the timing is better now than it has been in three or four years for a variety of reasons. The performance of our portfolio is strong. The change in performance is headed in the right direction. The capital markets are much more receptive to an efficient funding of a transaction like this, and many banks have ample liquidity and are looking for interesting and exciting places to invest their capital in order to achieve growth objectives. So I think from a timing standpoint, this point, is better than any we've seen since late '06, early '07. Regarding the performance of our portfolio and the more important strategic question of why consider selling these assets at all, I think that over time, we have grown to believe that it's in our best interest, the corporation and its shareholders' best interest to remove the funding equation in some of the inherent volatility of results from our financial statements while retaining the expected benefit of a handsome profit stream that should be left over, that we expect to be left over, after meeting the needs of our partner. Probably most importantly, we believe that with the right partner engaged with our current financial services team, we should be able to either improve the performance of this portfolio or grow it faster or both over time. And we very much look forward to enhancing the prospects for growth and profitability in the portfolio with that partner. Did that cover the waterfront?", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And then lastly, should we believe -- when we do the math, it turns out that this could be a dilutive transaction. Is that necessarily the case?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Depends on where you put the pencil down in your analysis. Certainly, if you stop at the level of selling the business, selling the assets, that is, and making some reasonable assumptions about funding and sharing and so forth, before application of proceeds, more likely than not dilutive. But of course, the application of the proceeds will give us an opportunity to take the equity capital portion that we had tied up in those assets and devote it to share repurchase, net of share repurchase may or may not be dilutive depends on the sharing relationship, and of course, it depends on the share price as well. The longer we continue trading at 6x projected 2016 or '17 EPS, the more beneficial share repurchase is.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "So you can envision a scenario under which it's actually accretive?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Possible. It isn't going to be a big issue one way or the other in all likelihood. Possibly mildly dilutive, possibly mildly accretive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Two questions. Could you just give us a number of what you think like-for-like inflation did to the comp last year? And Kathy, you talked about the plans on the rate strategy but what do you expect on that comp forecast that you guys talked about, what portion of it could be inflation?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Inflation, deflation was not a meaningful issue in our 2010 sales results. And while it's hard to say with any precision what it will be looking forward, obviously, we expect it to be a more meaningful contribution. I do resist putting a concrete number on it. There are too many variables right now for us to be able to make that prediction without misleading you.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, we are arithmetically calculated one time a year, and when we looked at the waterfront of our businesses some were deflationary, some were inflationary, and the net effect all in, was just a handful of basis points deflationary in 2010, just virtually negligible.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Don't you talk about that sort of 3.5% to 5% comp this year that it could be -- you're not assuming -- you assume that, that's the same this year?", "Douglas Scovanner", "No. The 4% to 5% same-store sales expectation that I laid out is an all-in figure. We're not going to be adjusting it. That's not a real increase that we'll adjust for inflation to be able to analyze it. That's an all-in figure from all sources.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "And then secondly on the working capital, the inventory did rise, I guess, about 5% or 6% last year more than payables. Is that -- are we comfortable with that level? And was there basically, is that a trend we should expect, given the growth of PFresh?", "Kathryn Tesija", "I'm very comfortable with our inventory position. I think our in-stocks are in very solid shape, and we did have some opportunity there last year. This time of year also is one where we do a lot of different transitions, and so the year-over-year comparison is a little less meaningful than other times of the year. But I feel very good with the categories that our inventory is in, and yes, food does have a lot of it. And I'm pleased with our in-stock position.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Imports have as much to do with this equation than anything else when looking at the relationship between payables and inventory. Obviously, we take title much earlier in the process on imported goods than domestic goods.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Kathy, first question would be on price increases, price pass-throughs of inflation rather. We're observing in the apparel sector that some of those price increases are moving through, observed it specifically in some of the branded product in apparel and denim. Just curious, your strategy, will you let the national brand sort of lead this and then take private label and follow in order to kind of test consumer reaction in apparel? And then any comments in Home specifically on inflation? The second question would be on overall sourcing strategy. I know TSS,  your internal sourcing, has been gaining or had been gaining share the last couple of years, which is a potentially a source of margin. Could you update us on that and the potential for that to offset some inflation?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yes. So your first question in terms of apparel and branded versus own brands. Of course, we control much more of the costing in our own brands because we design them and we source them and with national brands, we're working with them to understand what their increases are and make sure that we're being fair and equitable with what we take. And where we can't offset that, whether that's with promotional optimization or clearance optimization, we have been passing some of that through, as we will with our own brands as that happens. But we do have many more levers with own brands in terms of offsetting that. For example, how the garment's constructed, our standardization of fabrics helps us not only improve the quality and the consistency of those fabrics but then also allows us to aggregate yardage with fewer mills and get better costing. And then there's things we're doing with the supply chain as well. So it's not necessarily that national brand is leading and own brand will follow. They both will happen as the need arises. And really, the same thing in Home. But you are correct in that the apparel national brand basic product has already happened. And then in terms of overall sourcing, we are continuing to increase our share of imports versus domestic products, up just slightly this past year. But with the growth of our own brands, which is ahead of our total comp, that does help our import penetration.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Kathy, just to clarify, so that TSS penetration accelerating faster than your overall sales growth, that is a margin benefit for the company or one of those levers that can offset inflation? And then just to clarify in apparel, what kind of net cost increase are you expecting out of the category for the year?", "Kathryn Tesija", "It is a benefit to our gross margins, to import more through TSS so that is correct. And then we're seeing probably low- to mid- single-digit increases for the spring in apparel.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Jeff, just one more follow-up. A lot of cost pressures this year, probably more cost pressures than we've seen in a very long time. Clearly, private brand penetration is one of those offsets we continue to be pleased, with the private brand growing in food and with up & up. So that's plus size. On the negative side though, there is some shifting of the mix. So I wouldn't read in a whole, a ton if our import plantation goes up by 50 basis points or down by 50 basis points. Over time, we think that it continued to grow very slowly but there will be periods where it's both up and down based on what's happening with the shift in the mix of businesses that we have and the strength of those businesses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Gregg, you talked a little bit about the jeans and consumer shopping patterns this holiday season. What did you learn from that? And not to share any secrets of hot [ph] holiday 2011 but what might you do differently as a result?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, I think the learning. It's really not surprising that every year it is a different season, and you have to develop a good plan but be prepared for unanticipated changes in consumer sentiment, the use of technology, mobile devices and things like that. So we expect it to always be competitive. This year, we had a very strong beginning and start to the season. And we pulled some of those December sales forward. So we're focused on really understanding the guest research and their shopping patterns week-by-week all throughout November and December and trying to customize and tailor our plan to make sure that we are delivering the right kind of incentives and excitement that is consistent with what they are expecting in each of those weeks. Sometimes, they're very value-focused, sometimes they're very convenient-focused. Sometimes, they're in planning and preparation mode. So we're really trying to dissect the season and be more thoughtful in terms of how we market and approach the season on a week-by-week basis.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "And then Kathy, can you talk about the performance you've been experiencing recently in the hardlines and Home categories and initiatives that you have there in 2011 to maybe jump start the sales there?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yes. So as you know, sales have been more difficult in those two businesses than the rest of our portfolio. And in hardlines, I would say that it's mostly centered around the electronics and entertainment categories. I am excited about some of the new releases that we have coming up early this spring. I mentioned Nintendo 3DS, which is the first platform from Nintendo since 2006. So that should be very beneficial for Target since we over-indexed with Nintendo being more family-focused and young kids. And in Home, it's been really a mixed bag. We've seen some strength in housewares and certainly in our stationery and holiday categories. But we're still having some difficulty in domestic and part of the deck home business. So also within those categories, I think we're seeing some great results in our good product or opening price point when you look at Room Essentials and some of the things happening there. At the same time, we're seeing great strengths in the top end, things like Calphalon has been performing very well or KitchenAid or Keurig. So we're definitely seeing some more action in Home but it's still under-performing the rest of the company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Couple of questions. First, the 4% to 5% comp plan for 2011, Doug, just maybe any more granularity in terms of how you expect that to flow through the quarters. February maybe a comment there, how that's trending versus the low-single-digit plan? And then what does this earnings guidance you've laid out for 2011, what does it assume in terms of the amount of buyback that you will ultimately do?", "Douglas Scovanner", "As I tried to lay out in my remarks, if we actually end up in the 4% to 5% range for the year, we would expect to be lower in the spring than in the fall, not because of some economic crystal ball but primarily because of the contribution differentials, spring versus fall of those core strategies PFresh and 5% rewards. Much more specifically, I said that we expect PFresh to be about 1.5 for the year. It'll be certainly less than that in the first quarter and in that range for the balance of the year after the first quarter. Separately, as you know, 5% rewards, the contribution to our sales will build like a freight train as more and more and more households request the cards and begin using the cards driving incremental sales. So I said in my remarks that we think that, that increment might approach two full percentage points by the fall. It was only one full percentage point or $200 million, net of effect of the discounts in the quarter just ended. So think of that as a data stream that grows smartly from one today to two in the fall. And really the only comment I'd make is the fourth quarter will be a little lighter year-over-year than, say, the third quarter because of A, natural seasonality; and B, we'll be in year two, not year one by the time we get to the fourth quarter. So pull all of that together, it means I would expect that our aggregate same-store sales performance will be lowest in Q1 and lower in the spring than in the fall. Separately in Q1, as you recall from my remarks, we're cycling against the highest quarter in modern history measured in Retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margins. So clearly, we have a taller EPS challenge staring us in the eyes here in the next 90 days than in the other quarters. Share buyback, we, in round numbers as you know, we bought back about $2.5 billion, we invested $2.5 billion, that is to say, in share repurchase in 2010. The 2011 figure will be lower. It's certainly not sharply lower but depending on the progress we make in executing our business plan for the year, maybe it ranges in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion bracket for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just wanted to just touch on two things. First on your earlier comment about certain areas or certain categories where the better business has been tougher. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on which categories those are? And are you changing the mix to this year to adjust for that? And then on the consumer electronics space, which has been a really difficult area and I know is very product cycle-driven, are you starting to give any consideration to that area of the store, the type of space allocation you give to areas, particularly like packaged media? And then finally on the Gogo International, it seems like you're really pulling together your best designers and just kind of curious what your expectations are, if you're willing to share it from a comp perspective on that front? I think that was three items, I apologize.", "Kathryn Tesija", "All right. Let's start with the first, the better section being somewhat softer than good or best. I think we see that, in a few areas of the store, the one I would point to really is Home, where we're having incredible strength in the good brands that we carry things like Room Essentials, and we're also having fantastic response in the best, things like Calphalon or KitchenAid or Keurig as I mentioned earlier, Caldrea. But in the better area, things like our Home brand have been a bit softer, and so I talked about some of the things that we're doing: one, making sure that we are very clear about the benefits and the features of those products so guests understand when they're stepping up in price why that's worth it to them. And then also infusing more trends, so I talked about our blue and white trend statement that we're doing this spring, which will go across many categories in the Home area, and I think bring some freshness there and innovation in terms of not only the color and how that's infused in decorating but also within print and pattern. In terms of electronics and space allocation, it's still a very productive part of our store even though we have had issues with sales in some categories and even in the Packaged Media, still a very productive area. So we have cut space there over the past several years, and we will always be evaluating and looking out over the next five, 10 years to anticipate what those sales will be like and what kind of space we need. But I don't see any large changes happening there at the moment. I guess what we've sort of lost on the packaged good side over the year, we've picked up in the digital side within the electronics business. And so all-in-all, the space still remains in that area of the store. And then in terms of Go International, I don't have a comp for you but obviously, this is the frosting on our cake, it's the most fashionable product that we carry, and so it certainly won't compete with our core items in terms of volume but it does add an enormous amount of excitement, particularly for our young, very fashion-forward guest.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with JPMorgan.", "Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Doug, just wanted to clarify your guidance for the full year. Did you say 10% off the $3.86, does that include or exclude the $0.15 to $0.20 from Canada that you expect to incur?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I said a range surrounding 10% off of the $3.86, and that is net of the $0.15 to $0.20 adverse impact of Canada.", "Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then in the fourth quarter, gross profit margins were down about 40 basis points, and it sounds like that's mostly PFresh and 5%. Is that a good proxy for 2011 when we look at the gross profit line?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Actually, let me clarify the comment about the Q4 2010. The combination of the impact of PFresh and 5% rewards adds up to more than the gross margin rate decline. So net all other factors, we're slightly positive, and therefore, as an outlook, particularly as these strategies build to more importance in 2011, the combination of the two will be larger not smaller than 40 basis points.", "Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then, your allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the fourth quarter as a percentage of average receivables is about 10%. If you go back to in '06, '07, that was in the range of like 7% to 8%. Where do you think you get to by the end of 2011?", "Douglas Scovanner", "That's a heck of a question. Certainly, the risk trends, as I mentioned, are moving in the correct direction and rather swiftly, so it's fairly easy to see that the allowance as a percentage of receivables will naturally decline in the next couple of quarters. What might happen after that is a little more speculative because obviously, today, we can see, for example, as every credit card operator can see, the migration from current to one month past due and one month past due to two and so forth, and we have lots of internal science to be able to predict write-offs out three to six months. There's nothing in our current portfolio measured metrics that would tell us where those statistics will be in Q3 or Q4. But clearly, we're headed in the right direction, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that we could get back to the level of experience you just described by this year end.", "Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And just to John's earlier question about the profit stream that you could potentially retain, I mean, could you give us a range of what you think you could, in a perfect world, retain if you were to sell it in the fourth quarter of this year?", "Douglas Scovanner", "It's premature to speculate on what that looks like because it's premature to speculate exactly how the sharing will occur, said in much more straightforward terms, a partnership arrangement where we each have, where the partner has more skin in the game, would naturally be a partnership arrangement where the partner would have a much greater share of the potential upside. So in the more robust times, that kind of arrangement would leave a little more with the partner and a little less with us but the mirror image of that of course is, in thinner times, the differential for us wouldn't be as large. So it's a trade-off that we'll need to analyze together with individual partners to decide how much volatility we want to embed into our financials versus how much we'd want in the way of projected profits in the more robust times. Every credit card transaction executed by retailers with partner banks has these features. We're no different from anyone else in being at the beginning of exploration of how to analyze those trade-offs.", "Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then last question on February, you guys outlined positive low-single-digits, I believe, a few weeks back. Do you guys still feel pretty comfortable at that range?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Here's the first question that I have is, when you look at the comp trends over the last couple of months, I guess including February as well, can you just let us know why you're so confident in the 4% to 5%? And I think when I look at the metrics that you gave us around Kansas City, could you share with us the comp in Kansas City?", "Douglas Scovanner", "First of all, I don't think I used the word confident in the same sentence as the 4% to 5% so let's start from scratch. If we're confident about anything, we're confident that the two sales buildings strategies that we've launched, PFresh and 5% rewards, are working as advertised and contributing significantly to our same-store sales performance. Yet in contrast, I mentioned earlier that the U.S. market, for the kinds of goods that we sell, is not enjoying robust growth. I think that we certainly -- I don't often comment on competitor's information but we certainly saw earlier this week that the largest player in the marketplace had yet another quarter of very slight negative same-store sales. I think a lot of people are picking on my big brother. I think that's much more a reflection of what's happening in the macro economy to them and to some extent to us than having anything to do with their stumbles. That's as far as I'll go in analyzing their results. But for the record, I think that was a positive comment, not a negative one in terms of the challenges that they face and how they're addressing them. So I think the wildcard here, Bob, is what happens to the U.S. economy and while unemployment remains stubbornly high, we're not likely to see a robust base performance in our numbers. So there is clearly an expectation of that base performance remaining modestly or slightly positive that would get us into the 4% to 5% range for the full year, much more confident about the contribution of our strategies that we control than any confidence we'd exhibit about the macros and how that will play through the consumer.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes. I'll just add in addition to the unemployment, as you know the housing market still is not healthy and is a big challenge, and there is some very strong early signs of inflation that we've already talked about in terms of product categories from apparel and soft home and food. But the impact on discretionary spending with the pressure that's coming with rising energy prices can be a dampening effect on the broader economy. So as Doug said, we are confident in PFresh. We're very confident in 5% rewards. We have far less confidence about the underlying base macro environment that will affect all retailers in a like manner.", "That concludes Target's Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 18, 2011. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Good morning, and welcome to our 2011 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our first quarter results and priorities going forward, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our first quarter financial results and outlook for the rest of the year. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "This morning, we announced first quarter earnings per share of $0.99, up 9.8% on top of last year's 30% increase. This performance was the result of unusually strong profitability in our Credit Card segment, which offset the impact in the Retail segment of softer-than-expected sales. ", "In the Retail segment, driving sales continues to be our biggest challenge and #1 priority. Comparable store sales grew 2% in the first quarter due to the contribution from our remodel program and 5% REDcard Rewards. Outside of sales and traffic driven by these initiatives, guests were cautious in their behavior as they faced continued economic headwinds, including near record high prices at the gas pump. As a result, food and commodity categories performed well while we experienced less consistent patterns, including some sales declines in the rest of the store. ", "In our Credit Card segment, we continued to benefit from strong execution and disciplined underwriting by our team, combined with an improving credit environment. As a result, portfolio risk levels continued to decline, leading to a strong improvement in expenses and profitability compared to last year. While the U.S. economy is showing some signs of improvement, we expect the recovery will continue to be slow and uneven, particularly for more moderate-income households. We believe these households need to see further improvements in housing and income growth before they'll have the capacity to meaningfully increase their discretionary spending. In addition, unemployment remains stubbornly high, hampering overall consumer sentiment and spending. ", "Our PFresh remodel program is on track in driving meaningful increases in traffic and sales. We now have 550 general merchandise locations incorporating our expanded food layout, and we expect to remodel approximately 300 more locations by the end of October. These remodels completely transform the look and feel of the store, creating a more relevant assortment in a more compelling and exciting shopping environment. Guests continue to tell us how much they love what we've done to their Target in these remodels, and they show us by increasing their trips to remodeled stores, causing traffic to increase an average of about 6% in the first year after the remodel is completed. ", "Our other major sales driving initiative, 5% REDcard Rewards, is also performing as expected, enhancing loyalty and driving incremental traffic and sales among our better and best guests. Even though this program only launched nationwide last October, REDcard sales penetration increased 2.7 percentage points above last year to 7.6%, a level we haven't experienced since 2003. And household level data continues to confirm that just under 1/2 of this additional sales penetration is the result of purchases that are incremental for Target. ", "Beyond these broad initiatives, our merchandising teams are working diligently to drive units, consistent reliability and value on high-quality well-designed merchandise in every assortment. We are fostering an environment that rewards appropriate risk taking, ensuring our teams are constantly seeking new ways to surprise and delight our guests on every visit to our stores and target.com. We want our guests to be confident that they can find reliably low prices on the items they need while creating excitement with the latest fashions and trends throughout the store. ", "In our stores, we are vigilant in our efforts to provide a superior shopping experience with clean, safe, well-organized stores and fast, friendly service on both the sales floor and at checkout. We opened 10 new Target stores in March, getting 5 locations net of one relocation. We expect to open another 15 stores in the next 2 quarters, and we continue to look for opportunities to open additional locations of our current formats in markets throughout the U.S. ", "We're very excited about the upcoming launch of our new online platform, which we expect to greatly improve the shopping experience for online and mobile guests. This ambitious project is on time and on budget, and our team is now focused on executing a flawless launch in terms of stability and the overall experience. We've designed this experience to be best-in-class, providing greater personalization, advice, community, navigation, product detail and visual appeal. ", "Looking beyond 2011, we will continue to open additional locations of our current formats in the United States when we find projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. In 2012, we expect to open 15 to 20 new stores in our current formats and expect to slowly ramp up that pace in future years.  ", "In addition, we continue to develop our plans for a new small urban format called City Target and expect to open about 5 locations of this concept in 4 markets in 2012.  We're planning each of these locations with a very customized and local approach, designed to fit the particular trade area in which each store will operate. While this approach is a key to success for the City Target strategy, we expect to gain insights from these stores that we can apply to our larger format stores in the U.S. and Canada. ", "Our Canadian market entry continues to generate a great deal of excitement. We're still in the process of evaluating sites, working with landlords for the current Zellers stores to determine which sites we will begin to lease and subsequently how many of those sites will become Canadian Target stores. ", "Separately, we're building and developing a Target Canada team, which is responsible for developing and executing our marketing entry strategy. This team is deeply engaged in studying Canada broadly, along with each of the separate markets throughout the country. This will allow the team to develop a detailed merchandising and marketing strategy that will meet the unique needs of the Canadian guests in each province. ", "In addition, this team is developing technology and supply chain solutions that will allow us to open our first Canadian Target stores in early 2013. In each of these efforts, our goal is to stay true to the Target brand while ensuring that our strategy is appropriate for the Canadian market. ", "At Target, we say \"Speed is life\" and we're living it every day. Today's challenging environment requires that we carefully listen to our guests to understand their wants and needs. We need to constantly monitor the economic and competitive environment and understand how they impact our business. We're seeking new ways, both large and small, to drive traffic and sales in existing stores, while thoughtfully growing our store base in the U.S. and beyond. We won't take anything for granted. We're proud of our brand and long history of strong performance and committed to enhancing both.  ", "Our team, more than 355,000-strong, is aligned, energetic and moving our business forward. I want to recognize them for their tireless effort. They define our competitive advantage and make me proud to be at Target every day. ", "Now, Kathy will provide more detail on our first quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline initiatives for the second quarter and beyond. Kathy?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. In the first quarter, we experienced consistent strength in our less-discretionary assortments like healthcare, beauty and food, while we saw volatility in the sales of many other categories. At times, the volatility correlated with weather patterns across the country, and clearly, Easter timing had a dramatic impact on the pattern of March and April sales. ", "As we've outlined in prior conference calls, guests are shopping closer to the moment of need, waiting until the last minute to come out and cautiously spend. We saw this pattern in April as holiday-sensitive categories like candy, toys, entertainment and kids\u2019 apparel experienced a notable surge in the 2 weeks before Easter. ", "Recent guest research indicates that confidence in the future is once again increasing, particularly for upper-income households. Consumers continue to place a priority on reducing debt and are now more likely to save up before spending on events like a vacation. Guests continue to indicate that household budgets are tight, particularly in the face of higher gas prices but they acknowledge that their spending discipline creates fatigue over time, leading to an occasional indulgence when presented with the right opportunity. ", "As Gregg mentioned, we're working diligently to provide our guests compelling reasons to visit our stores and to fill their baskets on those visits. While we can help our guests by providing great prices on high-quality items, we can also help them to find opportunities to splurge, in small ways, that feel smart and responsible.  ", "In electronics, committed to providing more knowledgeable service, helping guests make more informed decisions and find exactly what they want. Our guest surveys show that we've made meaningful progress with higher ratings for an engaging experience and having knowledgeable team members who are available when they're needed. We've also added a trade-in program at our Target Mobile locations, providing guests a convenient way to responsibly return outdated devices while earning Target store credit that can be used for purchases in any category across the store. Target Mobile is in about 1,300 stores today, and we'll have this concept in about 1,490 stores by the end of June. ", "We're also pleased with the results since we launched My Target Tech last year. Guest satisfaction with this free support service has been very high, and we've seen a decline in electronics items returned since the launch of the program. ", "In healthcare, we're pleased with increases in awareness resulting from our Ask Us campaign, which highlights our approachable and friendly pharmacists. This year, we're continuing to focus on assuring our guests that Target can make healthcare easy and affordable, offering convenient services like flu shots at an amazing price. ", "In both Healthcare and Beauty, we've identified an opportunity to enhance segmentation across stores and markets, providing deeper multicultural assortments and addressing demographic groups like empty-nesters. ", "In Home, we've identified opportunities to better serve key guest segments in assortments like kids party, where we're seeing great results with our new owned brand Spritz.  We're also strengthening our assortment and presentation in key areas like kitchenware because we know that many of our guests are increasingly focused on cooking and eating at home. We're focused on an opportunity to help guests furnish small living spaces, providing thoughtful and affordable solutions that make these spaces feel more comfortable and functional. ", "And with our current dominance in seasonal holiday programs, we're focusing on an even stronger presence in key seasons: Valentine's Day, Easter, summer, Back-to-School, Back-to-College, Halloween and the fourth quarter holiday season. ", "Target's theme for summer this year is Make Summer Funner, highlighting Target's role in helping guests make the most of the season. We'll offer nautical-themed graphics on water bottles, beach towels, lanterns and paper goods and incorporate bright colors and sunny patterns in tabletop items, backyard essentials, picnic and beach supplies. ", "In apparel, we continue to see incredible growth in C9 by Champion active wear and we believe we have the potential to continue to grow this billion-dollar brand. This assortment is a perfect fit with the Target brand and core guest, providing men, women and kids with outstanding value on the latest technology on products that support their family's health and well-being. ", "We continue to evolve our designer partnership strategy, focusing on fewer but bigger programs. We're currently enjoying strong sales across multiple categories with our limited-time assortment from Calypso St. Barth. And we're very excited about our recently announced partnership with Missoni that will launch this September for a limited time. Target will be partnering with this high-end designer brought brand to introduce a limited-time collection spanning multiple product categories, including home, baby, beauty and apparel for women, men and kids. ", "Beyond limited-time programs, we're focusing on bringing value, differentiation and newness to every part of our store. For example, in denim, we continue to build on successful strategies from last year like adding additional fit options for women and deepening the category throughout apparel. In addition, strong back wall presentations look great and allow us to be more reliably in stock every day. We're particularly excited about our partnership with Levi Strauss and the launch of their Dennison brand exclusively at Target in July. This will provide a great opportunity to expand our branded offering and will serve as a perfect complement to our existing denim assortment. ", "In home, we're pleased with early results from the recently expanded Smith & Hawken collection available on target.com, which includes expertly crafted teak patio furniture, solid-forged garden tools and decor items.", "In food, we just launched 2 exclusive new Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream flavors in April, Volun-tiramisu and Peanut Butter World. These whimsical flavors support Target's partnership with Ben & Jerry's in support of volunteerism by encouraging guests to visit VolunteerMatch.org after they've enjoyed one of these summer treats. ", "In entertainment, we continue to enjoy partnerships with world-class artists across the musical spectrum, offering deluxe edition CDs with additional content available only at Target. In the first quarter, we announced partnerships with Grammy award-winning singer and actress Jennifer Hudson, and country artist Alison Krauss. With the theatrical release of the movie Cars 2 in June, we're planning a broad assortment of themed items across multiple categories, including bedding, sleepwear, food and toys. ", "In toys, we will make a dominant statement with 65 items, including 21 that are available only at Target. In our stores, we'll capture every child's attention with an interactive end cap showcasing an exclusive line of powered racing sets.  ", "And in beauty, we continue to make specialty beauty accessible and affordable through designer cosmetic and hair care collections. This spring, we're launching new products from Sonia Kashuk, Jemma Kidd, Napoleon Curtis and Pixi by Petra Strand. ", "In the last conference call, I outlined our plans to preserve gross margins in the face of input cost inflation in fabrics and other raw materials. During the first quarter, these pressures accelerated as rising oil prices lead to increases in shipping costs. As I indicated last quarter, we're attempting to drive down costs through product design, fabric standardization and optimization of pricing, promotions and sizing. However, in some cases, we've had to increase retail prices to offset higher costs, and we've seen others in the marketplace do the same. ", "For the spring, we've increased prices in the low- to mid-single-digit range for some categories in apparel, and increases have been in the double digits for some items in soft home. For the fall, we now believe increases will move into the double digits in both apparel and home and will affect a greater portion of these assortments than in the spring. We'll continue to be thoughtful and strategic in our approach to pricing, and we'll continue to monitor the market to ensure our prices remain competitive. Importantly, when we anticipate retail price increases, we are diligent in adjusting unit buys to ensure that our inventory position remains appropriate. ", "While we noted the environment presents numerous headwinds, we embrace the challenge of driving profitable sales and providing our guests ever-increasing value on the items they want and need. We know our guests expect Target to deliver on both halves of our \"Expect More. Pay Less.\" brand promise, and we are confident we can continue to earn deeper guest loyalty by anticipating their ever-changing needs and surprising them with newness on every visit. ", "Now, Doug will cover first quarter financial performance and provide details on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Doug?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide additional detail on our first quarter results then summarize our progress on the 2 major transactions we have underway, our acquisition of Canadian leasehold interests from Zellers and our intended sale of guest accounts receivable, and a related agreement to service these accounts going forward. At the end of my remarks, I'll wrap up with some clarified guidance on our expectations for the rest of the year. ", "As you know earlier today, we released our results for the first quarter which included earnings per share of $0.99, representing a 9.8% increase from the record $0.90 we earned in the first quarter of last year. As is usually the case, these results contain certain elements that should be celebrated and another set of elements that clarify our near-term challenges. ", "In our U.S. Retail segment, our sales growth was weaker than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, while our EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were in line with our expectations. Although these margin rates were lower than last year's levels, as we discussed in our prior conference call, this had more to do with the exceptional strength of last year's pace than with any aspect of this year's performance.  Our EBITDA margin rate of 10.1% of sales, for example, is the second best performance on this metric in any first quarter in modern history, second only to last year's achievement of a 10.7% of sales. ", "We expected our gross margin rate to decline in the first quarter due to the strength of last year's base and the impact of our 2 sales driving strategies, if the magnitude of this decline was slightly worse than we expected. Offsetting this impact, our expense performance was a little better than we had expected. Net-net, the key to our future prosperity lies in the continuing challenge to reinvigorate our sales growth while generally preserving our very healthy EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in this segment. ", "In our U.S. Credit Card segment, our core performance measures segment profit grew from $111 million last year to $194 million this year, principally as a result of an acceleration of favorable trends in nearly all measures of risk related to these Credit Card loans. As a result, bad debt expense recorded in the quarter fell to only $12 million compared with $197 million last year. While the magnitude of this improvement is not likely to be sustainable, our risk trends continue to be very impressive in this segment. ", "Also as previously discussed, our results today included a Canadian segment for the first time. In the quarter, we recorded $11 million of startup expenses in this segment, diluting our aggregate EPS results by about $0.01. ", "We aggressively executed against our share repurchase authority in the quarter, as we wanted to get a strong jump on our annual plan early in the year. In total, we invested just over $800 million buying back our shares, reducing our outstanding shares to 689 million at quarter end. This is the first time in decades that our shares have fallen below 700 million on a split adjusted basis. For reference we peaked at just over 913 million shares in the first quarter of 2004. ", "We continue to believe that this activity will create a lot of value over time for our remaining shareholders, as we believe that our shares are significantly undervalued, even in light of our challenges in the current environment. The value created from this activity will be especially strong if we come even close to producing the $8 of EPS we believe is achievable by 2016 or 2017.", "Turning to the 2 transactions which are in flight at the moment, let's first review our Canadian market entry. As you know, we agreed in January to pay Zellers a fixed price of CAD $1.825 billion for an option to acquire up to 220 of their existing store leases. At that time, we outlined our plan to convert somewhere between 100 to 150 of these sites to open as Target stores in 2013 and 2014, as the first step to what will likely add up to more than 200 Target stores in Canada over the next 10 years. ", "Our first payment of 1/2 of the amount owed to Zellers is due at the end of next week, enabling our acquisition of up to 110 of these leases. We're delighted with the progress we've made so far with landlords who collectively comprise the significant majority of the stores we want to convert and nearly all of the best stores we hope to convert.", " ", "Within the next few weeks, we expect to be in a position to clarify how many leases will be named in this first tranche, and more particularly, of that total, how many we expect will become Target stores after a significant investment in leasehold improvements. ", "Between now and September, we'll continue our discussions with the remaining landlords and also with third-party retailers to determine from the remaining Zellers stores which leases we might choose to assume for our use and which leases we might elect to assign to other retailers or assign back to the landlords, in either case, in exchange for some form of consideration.  Of course, any leases that are not ultimately part of our transaction will remain with Zellers. ", "Turning next to our intended sale of credit card receivables and to the related servicing agreement we intend to execute with a bank partner, the initial interest in partnering with us was as strong as we would have hoped and expected.  And at this point, we're proceeding to a phase of more detailed 2-way due diligence with a smaller set of carefully selected, high-quality, large financial institutions. Importantly, we continue to believe that such a transaction could potentially close later this year, allowing us to sell the existing portfolio and enter into a strategic and financial arrangement with our new partner, all on terms that each of us would view as in our best interest. ", "During the quarter, we successfully completed discussions with the Chase Card Services business segment of JPMorgan Chase to allow, at our option, an early exit of our 2008 transaction with them in exchange for paying a make-all premium at the time of such an early exit. This enables us to market our Credit Card portfolio to others without the complexity of needing the workaround or otherwise accommodate this existing 2008 arrangement. ", "Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and for the rest of the year. The dynamics I've just described regarding Canada envision closing on a large number of highly valuable Canadian lease transactions sooner than we originally anticipated. Strategically, this is terrific news. Although in the short run, it will create more of an expense burden as we recognize additional depreciation and amortization expense. 90 days ago, we said that the direct expenses of our planned Canadian market entry would burden our 2011 EPS by roughly $0.10.  And that together with indirect effects, our overall results would be $0.15 to $0.20 lower in 2011. ", "We also tried to be clear that these figures were likely to change as we gained more clarity throughout the year. As of today, we believe that the estimate for direct expenses should be raised from roughly $0.10 to a new range of $0.16 to $0.20 for the year, reflecting an expected $0.05 to $0.06 EPS impact in each of the next 3 quarters. This provision is driven in part by these strategically important real estate dynamics and in part to a more refined analysis than was possible until we were further along in the process. ", "In summary, both the expected profits once we open in Canada and the expected burdens prior to opening, are larger than we thought was likely 90 days ago. ", "Today, the median First Call estimates for Target for the second quarter and full year are $1 and $4.23, respectively. Our ability to deliver results in line with these projections depends in large part on 3 key measures of our performance. First, we clearly need to pick up the pace of same-store sales increases to drive the top line growth required to deliver this kind of EPS performance. We continue to expect same-store sales growth to meaningfully accelerate as the year progresses, even in light of our softer-than-expected sales performance in the first quarter.  So far through the first half of May, we've enjoyed a stronger sales trend, and were on pace to achieve growth in same-store sales, consistent with the low- to mid-single-digit outlook we shared at the beginning of the month. ", "Second, we would need to produce U.S. Retail segment EBITDA margins in the range of a fully healthy 10% for the year. In the first quarter, as expected, we experienced a margin rate decline, which put this rate at just over this 10% benchmark. And in the second quarter, we again expect to deliver EBITDA margins in line with our first quarter experience. For the fall, we would need to at least stabilize year-over-year trends to achieve a rate close to 10% for the year. ", "Finally, we would need to continue to experience the very strong trends we've enjoyed over the past several quarters in our U.S. Credit Card segment. We believe we're likely to enjoy average pretax returns on the capital Target has invested in this segment in the range of 20% or better on an annualized basis for the rest of the year. Please bear in mind that beginning in the second quarter, the kind of year-over-year growth in segment profit we've enjoyed for some time will be behind us, as the amount of capital Target has invested in this segment is quite a bit less than we had invested last year and as we cycle prior-year periods that produced similarly strong ROIC performance, driven in part by reserve reductions ", "So what does this all mean? To us, it means we recognize there are clear risks to our ability to achieve the magnitude of EPS growth implicit in current external estimates, and some of these risks were underscored in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, an EPS outlook of $1, which represents the current median First Call estimate, seems potentially achievable. Although as of today, it is above the midpoint of a reasonable range of likely outcomes. ", "Similarly for the year, $4.23 seems as if it is above the midpoint of a reasonable range, requiring us to achieve some combination of all the 3 key performance benchmarks I outlined a moment ago to get there. ", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We're pleased with our first quarter EPS performance but we're not satisfied with our Retail segment results. We are focused on driving sales through major initiatives like our PFresh remodel program and the 5% REDcard Rewards, while driving value and innovation in every category in our stores and online. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strasser with Janney Montgomery Scott.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I'm just trying to look a little bit at the demographics. I mean, I think one of the things that you've talked about a bit, Wal-Mart has talked about it particularly low [ph], and on work we've done at the lower end, in particular, continues to be a lot tougher than mid or higher end. Can you just kind of give a little bit of a view about what percent of your business is $50,000 and below? Or however you feel comfortable giving some of that graphics and just kind of frame sort of where some of that difficulty is coming from?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, the way we would characterize our answer to that question is that we take a look back at the profile of household income demos of our guests and the guests of several competitors through some purchased research. The last time we looked at this carefully, our median is just over $60,000, that is well above that of Wal-Mart and well below that of say Kohl's, Costco, Macy's, Bed Bath and others.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I guess if I ask you a little bit differently, what -- as you kind of look at your analysis of your customers, how different is sort of the, I guess, if you want to use the median, how different is the spending that you're seeing below your median income versus above or how impactful do you think that is to the business?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I think it's highly impactful, and I personally don't need to look any farther than what's happening with the success of our 5% Rewards program to see that the response by guests driving the incremental sales is very heavily skewed to guests who are already our best, better and best guests measured in annual sales. And by and large, that set of guests is above the median 60-plus thousand dollar income figure that I referenced earlier. So our sales growth is coming from the top 1/2, not the bottom 1/2 of the income profile of guest households.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "I would also add that the affinity for Target and whether they like us and enjoy shopping in our stores is very robust, and it's the same in all demographic strata. So even those that are more economically challenged at below the $60,000 or below the $50,000 a year household income still love shopping at Target but they just have less discretionary income to spend on those want kind of trips that as when times are better, they would look to Target to come to.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And just one last final question, I apologize, but as you kind of look at the REDcard, I know you kind of look at sort of the trend so far relative to what's happened in Kansas City. Has that continued? Has it gotten better or worse? Or is it still very much in line with that?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Our aggregate experience nationally is very much in line with precisely where we were in Kansas City a year ago, which gives me even greater confidence that what we said 3 months ago remains true today. And that is that we expect the contribution to our same-store sales performance from the 5% Rewards program to grow more rapidly in its importance, possibly adding close to 2 percentage points to same-store sales growth later in the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just, Doug, following up on that, if you could update us in the quarter in terms of the 5%, PFresh, what that contributed to the quarter comp and maybe help us think then what that implies for the core?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Each of 5% Rewards and PFresh contributed more than a full percentage point, by our estimates, to our total same-store sales growth of 2.0% implying that the core, as you term it, was slightly negative in the quarter. Using that same definition, I think it's important to observe that we're cycling against a core figure that was the strongest quarter last year by some measure. We do not expect the core, by that definition, to remain in negative territory for the balance of the year.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So just following that line of thinking, as you updated or gave us your thoughts on guidance, what does that imply for comps for the remainder of the year? I mean, last call, it sounded as if 4% to 5% was the commitment for the year. And how should we be thinking about that today?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I don't believe that I used the word commitment. I certainly used the words prediction or estimate or best guess or something of that kind in making that forward-looking statement. I believe that we remain quite likely to achieve 4% to 5% same-store sales performance in the fall. I believe that we're quite likely to experience better same-store sales growth in Q2 than we did in Q1. And likewise in sequence, better same-store sales growth in the fall than in the spring. Whether the math actually adds up and weights out properly for the full year to be better than 4%, hangs in the balance of how much better than 4% the aggregate of the next 3 quarters might be compared to the 2.0% that we just posted. Obviously, 2.0% was less than what we expected going into the quarter and therefore, it certainly adjusted the prospects of achieving 4% to 5% for the full year.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, helpful.  And then, Kathy, maybe your comments on inflation in terms of  what have you seen so far? You talked about low- to mid-singles in the spring, with soft home up double digits. Maybe give us a sense of elasticity and as you're expecting prices to be up double digits in the fall, you talked about being sensitive to units, how are you planning inventories in light of what you're seeing today in terms of elasticity of demand?", "Kathryn Tesija", "So in general, Adrianne, I would say that we are encouraged by our experience so far this spring. So you're correct that our apparel increases were up in the low- to mid-single-digit and we hit double-digit in some categories in home.  And in general, we're seeing that our competitors are also taking their retails up so the market is moving along with the cost increases.  And the response from our guest has been neutral to slightly positive on the sales line. So obviously, as we enter the fall season and the increases continue to grow in number of categories as well as the size, we need to continue to be very thoughtful and strategic in where we take those retail increases. But so far, based on our spring results, I'm encouraged.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Then just lastly, Doug, the fact that Canada, we should be expecting a bit higher and faster on the expense side, should that also imply that we should expect these stores to open sooner than originally expected?", "Douglas Scovanner", "No. Our timetable for opening stores remains the same as we previously outlined. We expect to open in several waves beginning in the spring of 2013 and we expect from among the Zellers leasehold interests to open 100 to 150 total stores between 2013 and '14, with the majority in 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Two questions. One is on the traffic in the quarter. Clearly, sales was a disappointment. And while PFresh and REDcard are building, we did see traffic decelerate really from at any quarter last year but right into this year to 0.4% from 1.6%. Could you describe what that is, if it is the REDcard is building, is it bringing that higher-end consumer into the store more? What was really driving that deceleration in traffic?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I think this circles right back to the discussion we were having a moment ago regarding, I think the word was the core. In other words, excluding PFresh and 5% Rewards, we were slightly negative for the quarter.  And the traffic trend that you're putting your finger on is right in line with that core figure. In other words, the fact that our units are accelerating and our average unit selling price is decelerating has a whole lot to do with PFresh, for example. And the traffic trend, excluding these initiatives, was negative in the quarter, and meaning that it drives -- it's a direct correlation with that implied negative core same-store sales result.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Again, I would also add that first quarter traffic deceleration trends could also be due to the fact that seasonal merchandise did not perform as expected throughout the store. You've heard from other retailers that it\u2019s been cooler and damper, so far compared to last year. And seasonal business is a big part of our business this time of year, and we too, were affected by that same trend. So portion of that was probably due to that as well.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Duly noted, Gregg, you mentioned the weather, not Doug.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We note it.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "And then -- and as a follow-up to that, if you're getting the traffic from that the higher-end consumer that has the REDcard, how are you thinking about really more aggressively changing the merchandising so that customer that is in your store more frequently actually cross-shops not just apparel, but home in particular where the comps have stayed soft?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we don't think the REDcard Rewards program changes the merchandising philosophy at all. I mean, we focus on newness and freshness and making sure that each and every experience is relevant. And so REDcard Rewards will complement that but there isn't any significant change in merchandising strategy as we think about that.", "Kathryn Tesija", "I would just add that because REDcard is our better and best guests and typically they are more affluent, that I think that's where we seeing some of the increases in our better and best price points, particularly the best. So some of our higher-end brands, this guest is shopping around the store, and we do see strength in that best category as well as good.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Gregg, you've comment -- or excuse me, Doug, you commented that expense performance is better than expected. Was that in Retail or just in Credit?", "Douglas Scovanner", "That comment was specific to our U.S. Retail segment.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Can you expand on that, please?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Certainly. So we're talking about favorable leverage in round terms of 20 basis points of sales on a relatively soft 2% same-store sales performance. 2% in same-store sales performance usually, all else being equal, would create more of a neutral than a favorable expense leverage environment. On the positive side of the ledger, and thinking through the things that are likely to influence future quarters as well, first of all, our stores' teams did a magnificent job, favorably leveraging hourly payroll and benefits in light of that sales performance. Separately, in the notes to our financial statements, you can see that effective with the launch of 5% Rewards, we re-characterized the intersegment intra-company accounting, essentially our Credit Card segment, has a profit-sharing arrangement with our Retail segment just as we would expect to have a similarly structured arrangement with a new bank partner moving forward. Those 2 items alone represented net 100% or more of the favorable expense leverage. Separately, in the category of things that happened in the quarter that don't really have forward-looking value or benefits from my standpoint, oh, there's a host of offsetting issues from timing issues to accrual adjustments to generally unfavorable leveraging of things that are inflating faster than our 2% sales. But in the aggregate, that whole bundle of issues, generally nonrecurring issues, if you will, was relatively neutral in the quarter.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "And then Gregg, you said that you're not satisfied with the results so far. How much of that is macro versus how much of that is within your control?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, it's hard to say. There's probably -- both factors are impacting our business. We clearly expected to drive stronger top line sales in the first quarter and we are disappointed that we didn't deliver on that. So we're working extra hard to try and gain share in both the discretionary and nondiscretionary side of the business. As we've said, our Beauty business, Healthcare, Food and need-based businesses were very, very solid and we struggled in the quarter in areas like electronics, music and movies, seasonal categories and some categories in home. All-in-all, we have to do better broadly across the store.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "All right. And then, Kathy, you talked about enhancing the segmentation in Healthcare and Beauty. Are you doing this in other areas of the store as well? And then maybe can you talk about is that technology-based or what's driving that?", "Kathryn Tesija", "We're segmenting across the whole store. My comment was, I think we, based on the success that we've seen, can go deeper in Beauty and in Healthcare. And this is fairly advanced at Target. We've been doing this for a number of years from volume strategies, climate strategies, lots of different segmentation. So this is just a continuation for us deeper into some categories where we still see opportunity. And particular, in both Health and Beauty, there's a lot going on there demographically. Our Hispanic and African-American guests are really responding for -- to our Beauty offering. And then I think with Healthcare, the aging of the population, that gives us opportunities to segment our assortment and improve upon our results.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "So this is really done at a centralized level as opposed to at the store level?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Was wondering if you could talk -- there seems to be a perception that 5% Rewards and also PFresh, to a lesser extent, are being met with some cherry-picking by customers. So in that regard, they're coming in, they're using the discount or they're buying the lower margin consumable items, and therefore the margin impact of these 2 programs is more severe to the downside than what was anticipated in the original guidance. So I know you've commented on this in the past, but could you just address that? What are you seeing in terms of cross-shopping in different areas of the store?", "Douglas Scovanner", "You need to segregate the analysis between the 2, but in either case, the assertion that you've heard is just not true. In the case of 5% Rewards, the mix of sales driven at the margin, in other words, the incremental sales mix, is only slightly different from the sales mix of our base business before 5% Rewards. In the quarter, that mix issue regarding 5% Rewards had a trivial impact on our aggregate gross margin rate. In the aggregate, gross margin rate was down between 80 and 90 basis points. And the mix issue related to 5% Rewards was a low-single-digit number of basis points of that 80 to 90 basis point change. So with respect to 5% Rewards, totally off-the-mark. With respect to PFresh, we have acknowledged many, many times that the sales mix on the incremental sales at the moment is very heavily skewed toward lower-margin merchandise in the store, but that is right in line with our expectations, not different from our expectations. There, there certainly is a sales mix issue. It is exactly the one that we expected. Net-net, taking everything into account, the gross margin rate on the incremental sales, the incremental expenses and so forth, PFresh continues to deliver aggregate profitability right in line with our original expectations. So the 2 programs do behave very differently. In total, if you look at the gross margin rate change for the quarter, the significant majority of the rate change is attributable to these 2 programs. Let's call it 50 to 60 basis points of the aggregate 80 to 90 total. The 50 to 60 is the impact that we would expect these 2 programs to have going forward. The residual amount, unexplained by these 2 programs in the quarter, having a lot to do with last year's base, by the way, is a little bit of residual mix, adverse mix unrelated to these 2 programs and net, a small amount of gross margin rate change, adverse gross margin rate change, gross margin rate decline due to things other than 5% Rewards and other than PFresh.", "John Zolidis - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And then on the Canada, just one follow-up. Do you still expect Canada to be accretive in 2013?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Expect the Canada, year-over-year, to be hugely accretive in 2014. Whether or not Canada is accretive in 2013 hangs in the balance of how dilutive it is in 2012, and that's something we have not commented on yet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Two quick follow-up questions. I was hoping maybe, Doug, you can answer this. Could you remind us historically, I am sure you guys have analyzed this up and down over the last 10 years, what gas pump price impact, generally, is on your customers\u2019 spending habits and traffic? And if where gas is now, if that pattern is playing out the way it has historically or is there something different this time? And then the second is just a follow-up on the line of questioning you've been getting from Gregg and John and everybody else. I just want to understand with the commentary you gave on the Rewards program. So I think you're saying that it's skewed to your best guests, and the incremental sales mix is generally in line with what you were looking for. So then if I look at that, is the non-REDcard part of your customer base comping even more negatively than we all realized in the non-consumables portion of your mix? And if you could just sort of give us sort of more of a picture of where the shortfall is then, in the sort of home and sort of non-food consumable space?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Let me address the second set of questions first, and we'll come back to the gas price question. Nothing's changed in our 5% Rewards experience from our initial read of the Kansas City data long ago. It's driving -- it drove in the quarter a little better than a full point of same-store sales performance. The combined impact of the low-single-digit basis point change in gross margin rate and the, call it 30-ish basis point, change in gross margin due to the markdown component of the program is right in line with our expectations, right in line with Kansas City. Nothing's changed yet the program itself is still small enough that it's not masking any kind of underlying changes that are different from what's aggregate and reported. This is 7% or 8% of our sales with a fairly small change in the aggregate, and so it's not changing or masking any underlying trends. What we're talking about is the underlying trends are the same trends with and without 5% Rewards. A 7% of sales component of our business can't have that kind of impact to change the underlying dynamics. Separately, on the gas price question. You have to see the smile in my face. We've employed MBA summer interns a couple of times to do a pretty careful and rigorous statistical analysis and has come up short of having something that is reliable in a statistically significant sense that I could describe as a correlation. So I would say that the relationship is logical but is very hard to show on a time series in any kind of proper statistical analysis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Just first on the CapEx, I don't know Doug, maybe you can talk about your most updated thoughts on what the CapEx could look like this year? Sounds like you've got some better visibility into what the new store plan will be for next year, so that's the first question.  And then the second question related to the inventory levels. I know at the end of April, on your sales call, you had said that they're a little bit higher. It looks like that was the case with the numbers today. Can you talk about kind of the complexity of that inventory? Your thoughts on markdown risk given it sounds like May is trending a little better?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Sure. First of all, on the CapEx front. 3 months ago, we said we expected CapEx in our U.S. Retail segment in 2011 would be about $2.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million.  And today, that outlook remains intact, $2.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million in the U.S. Retail segment. Kathy, do you want to comment on the inventory?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Certainly, yes. So overall, I think our inventory is in good condition as we enter the second quarter. We have very strong in-stock levels. As you mentioned, it is up. Our average inventory per store at costs versus last year is up about 6%, and it's really spread across categories so it's not lumpy or things that would worry me in terms of a markdown risk. So in total, I think it's good quality.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, that's helpful. And then one follow-up, if I could. Doug, on the D&A, it was -- you'd leveraged in the quarter down about 1% year-over-year, how should we think about those rates trending over the balance of the year, particularly as I think, we get towards the back half of the year probably it'd be some Canada stuff that's impacting that?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Yes, let's stick with the U.S. Retail segment for a minute and talk about Canada separately. Over the last 12 months, we reinvested capital about in line with our annualized depreciation and amortization expense, and that's why year-over-year in dollars, there isn't much change. Certainly, one of the underlying factors is that both in the last 12 months and in the prior 12 months, there's quite a bit of accelerated depreciation due to our PFresh remodeling program. You may recall that when we first launched this program, we talked about the incremental $100 million or so of accelerated depreciation as we're writing off and replacing store fixtures and other store-based assets before their economic life, before their book life is exhausted. So in both cases, maybe 5% of the annual figure is due to this accelerated depreciation phenomenon, certainly less than that in the quarter because there is seasonal impact to the accelerated depreciation. Turning to Canada, as we move into the back half of the year, we'll have amortization expense associated with the $1,825,000,000 of premium that we're paying to acquire the leases. And in addition, the stores that we intend to occupy for accounting purposes will highly likely be leases capitalized on our financial statements and therefore, not only do we end up with amortization expenses of premium but also depreciation expense on the underlying leases. A combination of those 2 for the year that are already embedded in the comments that I made about Canadian dilution, call it maybe $40 million to $50 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Just have 2 questions. The first one is on the e-commerce business, were the investments necessary in the potential top line benefits around the sole ownership and the responsibility for the e-commerce business as that business transitioned?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we don't disclose the investments that we've made in the technology in this overall re-platforming effort. I mean, it's been quite extensive over a multiyear period because Amazon has been the host for many, many years, and it's been a very significant undertaking for us it but it's one of the faster-growing parts of our business and we expect it to accelerate beyond even the fast pace that it is today when we launch the site fully later this fall.", "Douglas Scovanner", "And Bob, one thing I would add is the Amazon arrangement that we have today is largely a variable arrangement so it doesn't change margin dynamics at meaningfully higher or lower rates of sale.  And by pulling it in house, we're essentially investing a generally fixed amount that would create a problem if sales fell and will create a benefit, perhaps a very large one, if sales were to increase, especially if they were to increase a lot.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And the other question I have is back again on the 5% Reward program. When you look at the success that you're having with the top customers, can you talk about the ability to sort of penetrate the non-top 10% customers and sort of what you think the hurdles are to sort of get even more penetration up for the other customer base?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I think you're looking in the wrong place. Right now, the penetration of the top 10% with this program is very, very low. I think the path to prosperity lies in continuing to harvest more and more and more of the top 10%. I mean bear in mind, when we say that the sales lift among this top 10% who take up the card is 40% to 50%, it means that if we were successful in putting one of those cards in the hands of every one of our top 10 guests, who collectively today represent nearly 1/2 of our sales, we'd have a 40% or 50% sales lift on 1/2 of our base. We'd have an instant overnight 20% or 25% increase in our sales. The key to prosperity is continuing to market the program to the guests who already have a strong affinity for the brand and have the means and intent to spend a lot more when enabled with this vehicle.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Question on the allowance as a percentage of receivables. When I go back to pre-recession, I think you were probably somewhere around 7%, not quite at that level but around 7%. It looks like today, you're around 9% and I'm just curious based on what you're seeing and the progress there, what you think the likely level could look like at the end of this year?", "Douglas Scovanner", "I think that your observation is totally sound, and it is within the realm of possibility that our allowance by the end of this year could approach the figure you just discussed. 7% of gross receivables by year end is maybe not the center point of expectations but is clearly within the range of possibilities.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then if I could, a follow-up on or a separate question on price increases. You mentioned that the market was pretty rational in the areas, I guess, pertaining to cotton or cotton-related type, apparel-type products. I was curious in the case of food, what you're seeing in the marketplace as cost of goods rise for certain types of food products? Do you regard the market as being fairly rational?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yes. We see it rational across-the-board, not just cotton or fabric-based products, but across food and several other categories where we've seen some increases.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thanks, Dan.

Welcome to the Target Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 17, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I will provide a high-level summary of our second quarter results and strategic priorities going forward, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "We are very pleased with Target's second quarter financial results, which we released earlier this morning. We earned $1.03 per share in the second quarter, up 11.5% over last year's second quarter. This performance was a result of strong profit generation by our U.S. businesses, which more than offset $0.05 of dilution related to our ongoing investments in Target's Canadian segment. So far this year, earnings per share are up more than 10%, overcoming both dilution from Canada and the challenges of a volatile and sluggish economic environment. ", "As expected, the pace of our sales growth accelerated meaningfully in the second quarter. Across the country, every region experienced a healthy increase in comparable store sales. In total, our second quarter same-store sales increase of 3.9% is the strongest performance we've experienced in 4 years, and it reflects the continued relevance of our merchandising strategies along with the growing impact of our remodel program and 5% REDcard Rewards. ", "Our stores and merchandising teams continue to deliver healthy profitability in our U.S. Retail segment. Kathy and her team have successfully managed the impact of cost inflation, maintaining or improving category gross margin rates while delivering compelling value in the marketplace. And our stores' teams continue to deliver impressive productivity improvements while delivering great guest service our guests expect. ", "Our Credit Card team delivered outstanding results once again in the second quarter as disciplined underwriting decisions continued to deliver rapidly improving write-off rates. This team has done an amazing job managing the portfolio, successfully navigating through the economic pressures of the past few years and the regulatory changes that have resulted from them. ", "Serious economic challenges, including inflation, persistent unemployment, weak housing and financial markets and fiscal crises at every level of government continue to limit consumer confidence and spending. Though we are not immune to these factors, which are beyond our control, we remain keenly focused on ways we can create value for our guests and generate profitable sales for Target. ", "For example, we continue to leverage insights gained from our guest research to anticipate our guests' wants and needs and deliver the everyday essentials and exclusive fashion merchandise they expect. We continue to invest in new technology, enabling greater productivity, better decision-making and ensuring that our prices remain competitive.  And we continue to create a superior experience for our guests, whether they shop in our stores or online. ", "During the second quarter, we completed an unprecedented 180 remodel projects, a number that in the past would have taken us approximately 3 years to complete, and we expect to deliver approximately 140 more remodels by the end of the third quarter. These remodel projects continue to perform as expected. Our guests tell us that they love what we've done to their Target store, providing a fresh environment with enhanced visual elements and category transformations across the sales floor. ", "In addition to telling us that they like their new store, guests show us by increasing their visits and spending in remodeled stores. Beyond the value these remodeled projects bring to our current results, they're key to maintaining our relevance and guest loyalty over time. ", "When our guests choose to shop with us online, we want to deliver the same great experience they already enjoy in our stores. After 2 years of development, we're excited about the upcoming launch of the new target.com. This new site will present clean, compelling visual and will be easier to navigate and provide clear and consistent product information with an efficient checkout. This is a visible step in our ongoing investments in digital commerce, enabling Target to provide a seamless multichannel experience. Both in stores and online, guests continue to respond to our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty initiative. This program offers compelling value on top of our already low prices, leading our better and best guests to deepen their engagement with our brand, visiting more often and spending more across all of our categories. ", "Beyond our remodels, REDcard Rewards and our new target.com platform, we're also investing in projects that will drive future growth for Target. With our first City Target openings in 2012, guests in dense urban areas will be able to experience our stores without leaving their downtown neighborhoods. And in Canada, beginning in 2013, we'll bring Target stores to guests who already know and love our brand, but for whom a trip to Target has always required international travel. In both of these projects, the team is working to optimize assortments to match trade area preferences and demographics while fitting into smaller stores than we typically operate today. We expect to apply the insights we gain from these efforts to all of our stores over time. Of course, we also continue to invest in our traditional formats in the U.S., opening 9 new stores, or 7 net of relocations, in the second quarter. We plan to open 6 new locations in the third quarter, completing our new store program for 2011. ", "As I look ahead to the second half of the year, I'm confident in our position and the plans we have in place. Our remodels and 5% REDcard Rewards will continue to drive traffic, sales and guest loyalty, while new target.com will elevate the online experience. We've assembled marketing and merchandising plans to drive excitement and provide our guests outstanding value in every season throughout the third and fourth quarters.  And I'm confident that our stores' teams will continue their record of strong performance, driving productivity gains while delivering reliability and fast service to our guests. ", "Without a doubt, recent economic and financial market turmoil create additional uncertainty about what lies ahead. Our teams are vigilant and prepared to address unexpected challenges and opportunities as they arise. At the same time, our teams maintain an appropriate focus on the longer term. They're working to sell our Credit Card receivables portfolio on appropriate economic turns -- terms. They're developing next-year remodel program and the launch of City Target. They're working tirelessly to elevate the multichannel experience for our guests, and they're working around the clock to prepare for our Canadian market entry in 2013. Our teams are aligned in support of our strategy, and they have unparalleled energy and passion for our brand. Every day, I'm proud and inspired by their accomplishments. ", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on second quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline initiatives for the second half of the year. Kathy?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. We're very pleased with both the mix and pace of our second quarter sales. Within our assortments, some categories have been strong all year as guests continue to respond to our traffic-driving strategies and increase their shopping in areas like Grocery, Healthcare and Household Essentials. We've also seen consistent strength in Beauty, where guests are responding through our differentiated assortment, particularly in our remodeled stores. More notably in the second quarter was the improvement in sales trends of discretionary categories like Apparel, Home and Hardlines. Each of these areas experienced stronger same-stores sales compared with the first quarter. ", "In addition, sales of weather-related items in every part of the sore accelerated meaningfully in June and July, as more seasonable weather patterns emerged across the country. This improved sales trend created better sell-through in markdown-sensitive categories, helping our gross margin for the quarter. Apparel performed very well in the second quarter, led by Performance Active Wear, which continues to reflect rapid growth of the C9 by Champion brand. In addition, women's, men's and kids apparel each experienced healthy increases. Last year in kids, we took prices down to ensure we continue to offer a compelling value relative to the marketplace, creating a temporary headwind in our dollar sales even while unit comps stayed strong. We believe these investments in price paid off as we've gained market share in this key area and dollar comps are once again increasing. ", "We continue to see steady improvement in our sales trends in Home. Second quarter sales in every area of Home were stronger than the first quarter, with Housewares continuing to lead the way. Seasonal sales have been another bright spot, and we're pleased with early reads on Back-to-School supplies. In Hardlines, the most notable change has occurred in Electronics. Tablet sales, led by iPad, have been quite strong. And after some very challenging trends in earlier quarters, we're beginning to see stability and even some growth in TV sales. ", "As we've continued to study consumer shopping patterns, we're seeing clear contrasts between higher income consumers and more moderate income households. While optimism at all income levels has improved since the recession, wealthy households continue to be the most optimistic. Across all of Retail, the 20% of households with the highest incomes are shopping more often and spending more, while the other 80% have been cutting trips and spending less. Some of these trends are visible in our own results. We continue to drive meaningful traffic increases from a set of core guests with our remodels and 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, overcoming what otherwise would be a challenging traffic trend as moderate-income guests cut back on their trips. ", "As I look ahead to the second half of the year, I'm pleased with the momentum we've built in the spring, and I'm excited about our plans for the fall. We've always placed a high priority on driving trips and market share around seasonal events, and this year is no different. We feel great about our plans to create value and drive excitement for Back-to-School, Back-to-College, Halloween and the fourth quarter holiday season. As Gregg mentioned, our buying teams did a great job addressing cost inflation across multiple categories this spring, preserving category gross margin rates while maintaining our competitive position in the marketplace. I'm confident that these efforts will continue to pay dividends in the fall. We continue to believe that inflation will peak in the third quarter, with year-over-year cost increases beginning to moderate in the fourth quarter. ", "In Home, we've been listening to our guests, learning that they'd rather shop our domestics area by category, like sheets or blankets, rather than shopping by brand. While our guests still respond to our individual brands, they don't hesitate to mix and match between them, and they want us to make it easy for them to see everything that's available without shopping multiple aisles. With our September transition, we are going to do just that, create more dominant category presentations of items like sheets, comforters and blankets that will show the depth of our assortment. We're also rolling out improved signing to help guests navigate the department, and we'll continue to leverage our focal fixtures to feature individual brands and ensembles. ", "Across the store, we're focused on driving differentiation and value, supporting both sides of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. For example, in Apparel, we're excited to be the exclusive U.S. retailer for Levi's dENiZEN jeans for the entire family, which set a few weeks ago.  Priced to complement our established denim assortments, dENiZEN features sizes and fits that make it possible for all guests to find the right jeans. Our exclusive Vintage Varsity line takes inspiration from the Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum, which is located in a small Wisconsin town. The unique style of this artform translates to great design in a collection that includes everything guests will love for Back-to-School, from T-shirts to leggings to tote bags. Early results from this program has surpassed our expectations. ", "In Music, we continue to partner with some of the biggest names in the business to offer exclusives to our guests. This summer, we partnered with Grammy Award-winning artist Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles for the exclusive Deluxe Edition of her fourth solo album, 4. The Target deluxe album features 3 new songs as well as 3 additional dance remixes and DVD footage, all of which is exclusive to Target. Sales of this album have exceeded our plans, earning Target a very high market share for this release. ", "This year, we've already raised the bar with our designer partnerships, offering guests stunning and affordable limited-time assortments with high-caliber designers like Calypso St. Barth. And the momentum only gets stronger as we enter the back half of the year. We'll introduce our first-ever designer partnership in lingerie and loungewear at the end of October. Josie Natori is an internationally known designer, whose work incorporates a signature East meets West aesthetic. Her collection for Target will feature a full range of great options in bold Asian-inspired prints. Also in late October, we'll offer a line of decorative hats by Albertus Swanepoel, the South African-born milliner known for his handmade headwear. This limited-edition collection of unique and affordable decorative hats will be available both in store and online.  ", "L.A.-based designer Dana Kellin, known for her delicate wire wrapping and elegant stone combinations, has created an exclusive and affordable limited-edition collection of necklaces and earrings for Target starting this fall. Style icon Gwen Stefani is lending some of her own fashion credibility to our youngest guests. Starting in November, Harajuku Mini for Target, a spin on Gwen's adult line, will feature fashion for infants to tweens and will be priced starting at just $3.99. If we predict sales based off of social media chatter alone, we expect this collection to fly off the shelves as it's already been extremely popular on Facebook and a top-trending search topic on Yahoo! and Google. ", "Finally, our highly anticipated Missoni collection hits stores next month. Since 1953, the Missoni family has been known worldwide for its mix-and-match patterns, bright colors and unique textures. Target's partnership collection with this high-end designer is our biggest to-date, with more than 400 items, spanning multiple product categories, including Home, Baby, Beauty and Apparel for women, men and kids. ", "While our guests continue to shop cautiously and focus on value, they want us to continue to surprise them and offer them opportunities to indulge in smart ways. That's the essence of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. By listening to our guests and offering both value and fashion, low prices and a great guest experience, we earn their trust and loyalty, driving our performance both today and over time. ", "Now Doug will cover second quarter financial performance and provide details on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Doug?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide additional detail on Target's second quarter results and provide more detail surrounding the third quarter and full year EPS guidance we disclosed earlier today. In addition, I'll bring you up-to-date on the progress we continue to make toward our significant Canadian market entry in 2013 and our progress toward a sale of our accounts receivable. ", "In our last quarterly call, I described the 3 things that would need to happen for us to achieve or exceed the then-current EPS consensus estimate of $1 for the second quarter. At that time, I characterized second quarter EPS of $1 as achievable but above the midpoint of a reasonable range of expectations. Specifically, I said that to meet or exceed $1, we would need to enjoy a meaningful acceleration in the pace of our same-store sales growth from our first quarter experience, and we would need to sustain a healthy U.S. Retail segment EBITDA margin rate of 10% or more, and we would need to again deliver pretax ROIC of 20% or more in our Credit Card segment. ", "I'm delighted to report that our actual second quarter results met or exceeded each of these 3 performance benchmarks. And as a direct result, we delivered EPS of $1.03, representing 11.5% growth from last year's record $0.92. This rate of growth in our consolidated results was even more impressive, given that it was net of about $0.05 of EPS dilution from the results of our Canadian business segment, in line with our expectations. ", "In our U.S. Retail segment, our pace of comparable store sales growth rose to 3.9%, compared with our first quarter growth of 2.0%. In this segment, our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 10.3% and 7.2%, respectively. Similarly, year-to-date, these rates were 10.2% and 7.0%, in line with the annualized rates we strive to meet or exceed over time. Our U.S. Retail segment gross margin rate declined 35 basis points in the quarter, reflecting an adverse sales mix impact slightly higher than 35 basis points, partially offset by slight improvement in our gross margin rate within merchandise categories. In summary, I'd characterize these overall mix and rate changes as largely the direct result of our 2 core sales-driving strategies, partially offset by some unrelated strength in underlying gross margin rate within merchandise categories. ", "Once again, our teams exhibited excellent expense discipline in the quarter. In particular, we enjoyed favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense, which is our single largest expense driver that we control in the short run.  And yet again, we benefited from the year-over-year impact of the Credit Card profit-sharing arrangement between our 2 segments -- between our 2 U.S. segments. These 2 favorable items were partially offset by a number of smaller unrelated matters. ", "In the translation of EBITDA to EBIT, we also enjoyed 14 basis points of favorable leverage of depreciation and amortization expense, directionally a trend that we expect to continue to enjoy for a while. ", "In our U.S. Credit Card segment, second quarter profit performance was once again both outstanding and ahead of our expectations as we continue to benefit from rapid improvement in all key measures of risk. Segment profit was $171 million in the second quarter, up from $149 million last year. Measured against the capital Target has invested in this segment, we delivered an annualized pretax return of just over 28%, ahead of the very strong 20% we enjoyed in the second quarter last year. Very strong underlying performance in this segment is being augmented in the short term by substantial allowance reductions that will likely normalize sometime later this year or in 2012, meaning that the currently supercharged level of profitability derived from our receivables is likely to moderate somewhat in the near future, regardless of who owns the receivables at that time. ", "Our Canadian segment recorded $25 million of startup expenses and $11 million of depreciation and amortization expenses in the quarter. Outside of this segment, we also recorded about $10 million of interest expense related to capitalized Canadian leases, which Target assumed during the quarter. These 3 categories of expense combined to contribute to the $0.05 of EPS dilution I referenced earlier. Our balance sheet at the end of the quarter reflected about $2.4 billion of net property related to the Canadian store sites we selected in May, consisting of a combination of the allocated portion of the value to be paid to Zellers for the 105 leases we selected and the period-end capitalized value of the obligations we owe to landlords under the leases themselves. ", "Turning now to share repurchase. We invested almost $700 million on this activity in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to about $1.5 billion, already touching the low end of the annual range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion we laid out 6 months ago. To reiterate, this range of 2011 annual expectations is before the additional share repurchase activity that would likely result from a sale, if consummated, of our receivables. This latter activity would, in essence, represent application of the Target Corporation equity capital freed up in such a transaction. And we believe this repurchase activity would potentially offset the majority of ongoing EPS dilution from such a sale. Again, we plan to quantify all related EPS effects if and when we announce a sale, although we continue to expect that the ongoing dilution is not likely to be substantial. In summary, we believe that our shares currently represent an exceptional value, in light of our U.S. and Canadian prospects in both the intermediate term and long term, and we intend to continue to pursue the opportunity to selectively retire our shares on behalf of our shareholders. I plan to elaborate on this topic when we meet with you tomorrow in New York. ", "Let's now turn to our progress in the 2 strategically important transactions we're pursuing. As you know in May, we named the locations of the first 105 sites related to leases we assumed in our Zellers transaction. And in June, we announced that we had reached an agreement to transfer up to 39 leases for additional Zellers sites to Walmart Canada. We continue to work with landlords and third-party retailers on the remaining leases to optimize our economic and strategic outcome. We had originally forecast that we would likely end up with 100 to 150 Target stores flowing directly from this investment. And as of today, we can tighten this to a more likely range, a most likely range of 125 to 135 Target stores, including substantially all of the top 100 sites which drive the vast majority of our expected return on this invested capital. ", "Separately, our discussions with potential buyers of our Credit Card receivables also continue to progress as we hoped and expected. The level of mutual interest between Target and potential buyers has met or exceeded the expectations that we had when we began this process. In summary, we continue to believe a transaction which meets our objectives and those of a potential buyer could close later this year or early next year. At the moment, recent turmoil in global capital markets does not appear to have changed this view. We'll, of course, keep you up-to-date over time as appropriate. ", "Now let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year, which we clarified in EPS terms in our press release earlier today. Needless to say, the pace of same-store sales growth remains the most important variable in determining our actual EPS results in the fall season. In essence, we'll likely produce results at or above the midpoint of our disclosed ranges if our pace of sales in the third and fourth quarters meets or exceeds our second quarter growth in same-store sales of 3.9%. In other words, if there turns out to be little or no measurable effect on our growth related to the factors causing so much recent uncertainty and turmoil in the global capital markets. ", "Alternatively, if our fall sales growth were to fall short of our second quarter experience, we'll likely produce results below the midpoint of these EPS ranges. For whatever it's worth, our pace of sales growth month-to-date in August is within the range of our expectations for the month, although slightly below our June, July experience. Importantly, given that our guests continue to buy closer to the moment of need, the next 2 weeks will represent the heart of our Back-to-School and Back-to-College sales. As a result, we think it's too early to judge our overall sales growth in August. ", "Even though a significant portion of our year-to-date consolidated EPS growth has resulted directly and indirectly from the exceptional performance of our U.S. Credit Card segment, the majority of our planned fall season consolidated EPS growth will flow from the growth of our U.S. Retail segment EBITDA and EBIT, resulting directly from the results of our integrated sales-driving strategies. Contained within our consolidated EPS guidance is an outlook for our Canadian segment for this year, consistent with the previously disclosed range of $0.16 to $0.20 of dilution. Our consolidated EPS outlook of $0.70 to $0.75 in the third quarter and $4.15 to $4.30 for the full year means that our 2011 outlook has changed very little from the guidance we provided 6 months ago, as the unanticipated strength in our U.S. Credit Card segment will likely offset incremental Canadian dilution that wasn't in our forecast at the beginning of the year. Of course, this outlook excludes the impacts of a potential Credit Card asset sale in the fourth quarter, impacts we would outline in detail if we were to reach such a sale agreement. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "As I mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with our financial performance in the first half of 2011, and we're planning on delivering strong results in the fall season. We believe that a focus on both sides of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise will prepare Target to perform well in a variety of economic environments. ", "One final note. At tomorrow's financial community meeting in New York, we'll extend our outlook beyond 2011, outlining our strategic initiatives while providing additional detail on our longer, long-term financial goals. For those of you unable to attend, we'll webcast both the remarks and visuals live. That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Kathy, just a couple of questions for you or you and Gregg. In terms of the upcoming holiday season, could you talk more specifically about opportunities that you see for share gains? Given last year's performance, I know December, as a month, was slower in total retail sales for the industry. But I think a couple of categories, Toys and Electronics, were particularly challenging. Can you talk about opportunities you have there? And then just generally speaking, how has your competitive analysis changed, if at all, in the last few years in terms of how you're viewing competitors in each of these key categories?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yes, I'll start, Jeff, with your first question, about the holiday opportunity. And we do think that we have a lot of opportunity in the fourth quarter in a variety of categories. One, I would say certainly, Toys, which started off the holiday season very strong but ended weak, I think, we've got some opportunity, particularly in the month of December. And we've looked at our guests' buying patterns actually on a weekly basis throughout the holiday season to make sure that we're tailoring our assortment and our promotions with their mindset during each week of the holiday season, so I feel great about that category. Electronics was also challenging, but I do think some of the trends that you've seen building this spring with the iPad, for example, or e-readers, I think that those will bode well for the back half of the year. And we overindex with products like that. That's prime territory for our guests. I also think that our Apparel business has been gaining strength, and I think that bodes well for the holiday season, as well as a lot of the gift categories in Home. So we've talked about the improvement there really being led by Housewares. And I see that helping us as we move into the fourth quarter. In terms of our competitive analysis, I don't know that, that's changed. We continue to look at the same people, a wide variety of competitors. But I guess I would tell you that we're really focused on our game, making sure we understand our guests and how our products fit with their needs, so we haven't really changed how we look at competitors.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The only other thing that I would add, Jeff, is because we're -- we have high expectations for our online business now that we're converting to our own platform, we've been focusing more attention on other online retailers, and we've added them to the mix to make sure that we really understand the breadth and the depth of those competitive retailers. So that's really the only meaningful change that I would say we've made over the last 6 months.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay. Just one other -- one other clarification, just on mid-year cost of goods inflation. You see some mitigation of that inflation in the fourth quarter. Is that across categories? Is that Apparel specifically?", "Kathryn Tesija", "I would say it's fabric-related, so Apparel and soft Home, predominantly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Just a quick question, Doug, on the U.S. Retail SG&A. I know you did lever -- the growth rate did pick up, though, from the first quarter. Can you talk about maybe how you see that trending in the back half of the year, assuming, let's call it a 4% comp environment?", "Douglas Scovanner", "4% comp environment in the back half of the year, we would expect to continue to favorably leverage SG&A expense in each of the 2 quarters.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. And was there anything in this quarter that was maybe one-time or transitory in terms of the costs or no?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Certainly, and I would say that, that's usually the case, plus or minus, in every quarter. But net-net, I outlined the big issues that were isolated. Specifically, we continue to do favorably leverage store hourly payroll, which is obviously a wonderful thing to be able to do, and I think a reasonable leading indicator of what to expect in the fall season as well. Separately, as you know, there's a profit-sharing arrangement between our 2 segments, and some of the excess profitability of the Credit Card segment serves to reduce SG&A expense as a percent of sales in our Retail segment in a manner consistent with what you've seen many other retailers describe here in the quarter as well.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up, over to the Credit segment. Obviously, the profit is growing nicely. You talked about how that would slow. As we look through the balance of the year, I mean, is it reasonable to assume that credit profits still grow year-over-year? Or could we be in a situation by the fourth quarter where perhaps credit segment profits are actually down year-over-year?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Certainly, as I said in my earlier remarks, we expect the rate of growth to slow considerably sometime later this year or early next year, as we normalize write-off in allowance relationships. Could it happen by the fourth quarter? Yes. The wildcard question you're really asking is what -- in my terms, what will the annualized write-off rate turn out to be when we settle into a new pattern? It's been dropping rapidly for well over a year. In the quarter just ended, for example, our write-off rate was 6.5% of receivables, almost half of what the write-off rate was. Last year, in the same quarter, it was over 12%. So we ended the quarter with an allowance of $480 million, that's 7.7% of gross receivables of $6.2 billion. The real question is, will the write-off rate settle in at 6%-ish? In which case, it will happen fairly soon, things will normalize by the fourth quarter and the dynamics you outlined would come into play, given the lower level of gross receivables that we're carrying now compared to last year. Alternatively, if it settles in at more like a 4.5% or 5% write-off rate, then we'd have several more quarters of this kind of benefit. It's too early to tell what that timing will be. But certainly, no later than sometime in 2012, we'll settle into a more normalized pattern with a more typical amount of bad debt expense in our Credit Card business segment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Doug, I guess the first question I have is, given you talked about a lot of the uncertainty from the last couple of weeks, the forecast that you've given us today, sort of third quarter and fourth quarter, have you made any sort of changes to those over the last few weeks in light of what's happening out there right now?", "Douglas Scovanner", "No, we certainly don't react like that in the short run, yet I would step back and acknowledge that if we were to expand the list of things that have gone our way and things that have gone against us so far this year that allow us to still be in the same position with the same earnings outlook we outlined 6 months ago, in my remarks, I mentioned on the positive side, the exceptional strength of our Credit Card business segment. Certainly, a secondary issue on that list would be that the exceptional cash flow from operations, partly driven by profitability in the Card segment and reduced receivables has allowed us to pick up the pace of share repurchases and get much farther much faster than we expected. That clearly has a beneficial effect on this year's earnings per share as well. On the negative side, I mentioned that our Canadian dilution now, same as it was in our disclosures 90 days ago, is higher than we outlined at the beginning of the year due to a variety of factors, some of them very powerful positives in the long run. In addition, obviously, our U.S. sales have been softer than we outlined at the beginning of the year. But that's not a change that's occurred here the last couple of weeks. We expected sales to be stronger as the year progressed. We did not expect the first quarter to be as soft as it was. On an absolute sense, certainly, our sales aren't likely to be as strong in the third and fourth quarters as we might have thought 6 months ago, but that view hasn't changed in the last few weeks.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then I think Kathy said \"pleased\" with the early reads on Back-to-School supplies. Have there been any surprises thus far either competitively or within your stores on the trends in Back-to-School?", "Kathryn Tesija", "I don't think there have been many surprises. I would say guests continue to shop. Some of them are very planful and they shop early. The majority of guests, though, continue to buy close to need. So we still have a ways to go here before the exact results of Back-to-School, Back-to-College. But I would tell you that the early shopping results from Back-to-School supplies was very strong, and we saw guests trading into better product, which we were pleased with. I guess the only thing I would say is that I do think the competitive environment has been a little bit more reasonable this year in Back-to-School supplies. And so again, we've got the bulk of the season ahead of us. We'll see how that progresses, but so far so good.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Great. And then my last question is, Kathy, could you give us AUR maybe in the first half on Home and Apparel and your expectations for AUR in those categories for the second half of the year?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Well, I would tell you, obviously, they're both up in the first half. As we talked about previously, we were looking at low- to mid-single-digit in Apparel, and some mid-digits in Home. As we progress into the third quarter, we're going to see double-digit in both Home and Apparel. Most of that is hitting in Apparel here in August and September. So there's increase not so much in prices on particular items, but more items increase as we move into the third quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to ask how much of the sales mix right now is the food and consumables? And how far through the remodel campaign are you on PFresh?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Food and consumables represents midway point between 15% and 20% of our sales. By the end of this year, we will have completed approximately 900 out of the, say, 1,400 or 1,500 stores, general merchandise stores that we're going to be PFresh-ing. So that's 60%, 65% by the end of the year.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then your tax rate was a little lower this quarter. Is that a factor caused by Canada? And should we expect a lower tax rate over time because of Canada? And maybe just an outlook from Doug on the tax rate for this year and next year.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, as we disclosed 90 days ago, we expected a tax rate between 36% and 37% for the year, and it came in at 36.4% for the quarter, right on the midpoint of our range of expectation. So lower is lower than last year but not lower than expectations. And it's driven by all kinds of factors. Canada perversely actually drives it higher in the short run because Canada has a lower tax rate. And a lower tax rate during a period of losses in Canada actually increases, not decreases our consolidated tax rate. This will be an enormous benefit over time when Canada turns the corner. But in the short run, it's a drag.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "A couple of quick questions. One of them, I guess, is for you, Doug. Just quickly, the remodels, the 180, were they significantly disruptive to the comps during the quarter? And if so, can you give us any quantification on that? And then I have a few other follow-up questions.", "Douglas Scovanner", "No more disruptive than they've been recently. We've been working super hard to minimize the disruptive impact to the extent that we can. So it's a few tenths, but it's not any different from other quarters in which we've had this degree of disruption in the last year, 1.5 years.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then the other question I had for either Gregg or Kathy, in your comp composition, the selling price per unit was up for the first time in, I think, over 2 years. I think, when you were answering Bob Drbul's question, you talked about more price increases coming through. Can you sort of paint a picture for us? And I think you also mentioned trade-up, a little of a trade-up you're seeing now, Kathy. Can you paint of a picture of what -- can that selling price per unit keep accelerating? Is it mix driving that or price increases coming through? Do you think you are now finally seeing some of that trade-up we've all been waiting for?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yes, that's hard to give you an exact number, although I would tell you I think what you've seen so far is predominantly price increases and some trade-up. The trade-up we're seeing in very specific categories, as I've outlined in the past. In Home, in particular, our good segment has been the strongest. But we've also had some great strengths in the best segment. So when that 20% of guests that I talked about that are in the higher-income levels, they're willing to spend more. And in areas like Home, where we have high-end products like Fieldcrest Luxury and Smith & Hawken, we are seeing them trade up. And in fashion, I will tell you, where we have increased the retails and added more into the make of the garment, we're seeing those perform better. So I believe we're seeing some slight trade-up, but mostly so far, I think what we've seen is a price increase.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Analysis of average unit retails in a business with a breadth of assortment that we have is a supremely complex exercise. I'll take food for an example in the quarter just ended. There clearly was some inflation in our average, driving average unit retails higher in our food assortments, yet our food category grew much faster than the rest of the business. And food retails, on average, are quite a bit lower per unit than retails in the rest of the store. So even analyzing food for a moment has 2 competing and quite substantial factors that partially offset each other. This is a really, really complex analysis, given the breadth of our assortments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Two questions. First, Doug, quickly on the CapEx. I assume that number, the $1.7 billion in the quarter included the Zellers -- the payment for Zellers, the first one?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Yes.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "And for the full year, is the CapEx x those payments where you expect it to be, around the $2.5 billion still?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Yes.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Perfect. And then Kathy, maybe to follow up on something you said about the future on assortment. The changes you're making to bring sheets and other things together, is that just reordering things in the store? Or are we actually changing the SKU counts and buying different things as part of that?", "Kathryn Tesija", "I would tell you that the change that will start to happen in September, there's some product changes. Most of it is merchandising, putting components together. So in the past, we would've had collection bedding that would've been merchandised by brand. So for example, Fieldcrest Luxury would have had a run that would have sheets, blankets, duvets all mixed in together. And starting in September, we're going to break that apart so that all components will be together. So all sheets will be together, all duvets together, all blankets together. Of course, we always have product updates with every transition, so you will see some of that. But I believe from a guest perspective, the most notable change will be how it's merchandised.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Great. And then lastly, if we look at the inventory, up just over 4%. Maybe it's a follow-on from the AUR discussion. How much of that 4% increase would you say is attributable to the higher prices or inflation of what you're buying?", "Douglas Scovanner", "We honestly can't answer that question. I could speculate, but there's so much in the way of dynamics in that figure that it's not possible for us to know that. We analyze inflation at a fairly precise level or as precisely as we can analyze it once a year, and that's as of October 31.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "You mentioned that the pace of same-store sales was obviously key. I'm wondering, Gregg, when you step back and you look at comps have accelerated from Q1 to Q2, obviously, the weather was much more accommodating. That helped. But it seems as if discretionary categories started to improve. Are we finally starting to see customers cross the aisle as we had hoped?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, I mean, they never abandoned the other side of the aisle. They're just slightly more confident in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter. I mean, we've laid out the case, as Doug mentioned earlier, that we expected our same-store sales to accelerate throughout the course of the year. There's still pressure on the discretionary categories. But I think over time, if we offer the right items at the right price and we're offering value and our merchants do a great job, like they have been in terms of merchandising within the discretionary category, we'll continue to gain share and that side of the business will strengthen. We saw some of that in the second quarter, and we expect that to continue as we go forward.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. And then, maybe, you had talked about in the remodels you're seeing higher visits. Maybe shed some light in terms of what you're seeing between the categories, the discretionary and more staple side of the store, what you're seeing in the remodels.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, I mean, the pattern hasn't really changed materially from what we've been experiencing over the last 2 years. We get in immediately -- immediate large bump in our food business and related crossover categories, and we get a very slight increase in nondiscretionary. And over time, we expect to convert more of that traffic to the nondiscretionary -- or to the discretionary side of the business. But that's a long-term objective of ours. So out-of-the-box, it's primarily food, it's health and beauty aids, it's household chemicals, papers and those kind of related categories. And it's really about engaging the guests, getting her more comfortable shopping our stores more often, building loyalty and trust on the need side of the business, on the frequency side of the business, and then we will continue to market to her all the other great things that we have throughout the store. So the food is a planned trip, and then the less-planned trips, she will experiment and she will spend more time on the other side of the store as we begin to market those categories more aggressively to her via direct mail, receipt tape marketing and some of the other alternatives that we have.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, great. And then maybe just shifting to the gross margin outlook in the back half. As you have seen some improvement in the discretionary category performance, and you've obviously got some exciting launches coming in the back half, how do you think about the mix shift as we head into the back half if, in fact, discretionary perhaps starts to improve and you're lapping some easier comparisons from a year ago on the gross margin line?", "Douglas Scovanner", "There will be some shifts. I think they will be fairly subtle over time. Certainly as a broad theme, we would continue to expect year-over-year adverse mix Q3, Q4 in terms of the impact on gross margin rate just as we've experienced for quite some time, both as a result of our sales-driving strategies and as a result of what typically happens with the passage of time here, regardless of those 2 strategies. Separately, I would expect to continue to leverage operating expenses and continue to enjoy the benefits of favorable leverage in depreciation and amortization expense. Net-net, we said 6 months ago that we expect those very factors to generally offset within our Retail segment for the year, delivering EBIT margin rates in line with 2010 experience, and that remains our outlook today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "A few questions. You talked about on the call that the 20% highest income is really driving the growth. Is there any change in your thought process as regards to merchandising or marketing as a result of that?", "Kathryn Tesija", "First of all, Deb, what I was talking about is that, that's sort of an industry number that we're seeing -- that, that's the group that's shopping, taking more trips and being more confident. At Target, what we're seeing is a pattern of more trips through all of our guest segments. Clearly, it's stronger in that upper income, but we're seeing it in every income level. So we do believe that we are gaining some of the trip consolidation that's happening. As guests are trying to save money on gas and taking fewer trips, they are choosing Target as a one-stop shop, and so we think we're benefiting across all income levels.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "And then Doug, what do you think is the most important variable for your same-store sales growth?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Consumer confidence and GDP and employment all wrapped into one set of related macroeconomic statistics.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then last question, as we look at your core comp, how should we think about the contribution from PFresh and 5% Rewards for the quarter?", "Douglas Scovanner", "Well, certainly, it's getting harder and harder to give you a reliable numerical answer to that question because so much of our chain -- and not any random portion of the chain, by the way, has been converted to PFresh. And separately, with the whole country under a 5% Rewards loyalty program, we don't have any base stores to compare the incremental performance. But keying off of the outlook that we gave at the beginning of the year, we can certainly make a broad statement. We said then that we expected PFresh, as the year progressed, to deliver somewhat more than 1 point of same-store sales performance. We said that later in the year, we expected 5% Rewards to grow to more than 2 points of contribution. So haircutting those themes a little bit for Q2, any way you slice it, the contribution of those strategies clearly was less than the overall comp of nearly 4%, whether the base in isolation in that sense was 0.5, 1 point, 1.5 point becomes kind of academic in its exercise. But clearly in that kind of analytical workup, it would be positive no matter how you slice the numbers.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "You're really definitely seeing some underlying strength in your base comp?", "Douglas Scovanner", "No. As you're defining the base comp, certainly, that was the case for the quarter, yes.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes. I think what we're saying, Deb, is going forward, PFresh, 5% Rewards, that is so integrated into our strategy, that is really our base comp going forward. There really isn't a core base remaining group anymore because we've got 5% everywhere. There are no control stores. We have, by the end of the third quarter, PFresh-ed over 900 stores. There aren't good comparisons. We've done the best stores, best market. And so that really becomes the great one-two punch, and it's integrated. That really is the base business of Target going forward is it's the combination of those 2 elements that represents our base and our core.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes, just on that topic of PFresh and so on. Gregg, as you think about the stores that are left to do and what you have going on in Canada, would it be a fair assumption that we should be thinking about PFresh really getting scaled back in '12, just so you can manage all the things that have been going on? Or are you going to continue to try to finish up the remaining group?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "We have a plan for 2012 and 2013. We have planned for -- we haven't released the number next year, but we really believe that this is the right strategy. It has delivered great results. And so we are planning to continue with PFresh in 2012 and 2013, completing the chain. These are going to be fill-back stores in existing markets because there aren't any markets that we haven't already initiated this change. But this is core part of the strategy. And regardless of what's going on in Target Canada, we're going to continue and get through the balance of the chain over the next 2 years -- or 90-plus percent of the chain.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then Doug, just had one question for you. Coming back to the net write-off, where you were talking about earlier in the portfolio, that's also a function of growth in receivables. And it looked like the growth in average receivables, the decline was not maybe as bad as the first quarter. So I guess, as you think about the back half of the year, it still declines, but can you put some parameters around the rate of decline? And if that starts to grow again, obviously, that's going to drive that write-off rate even down more.", "Douglas Scovanner", "Yes, certainly. What's going on in terms of gross receivables is right in line with the expectations that we previously laid out, specifically that we expect gross receivables to be fairly steady sequentially, in the range of $6 billion, $6.2 billion in the quarter just ended. There will be versions of that theme moving forward. Against the year or against prior year actuals, it means the rate of decline will continue to be lower and lower.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Your main competitor has talked about price investment a lot in the past. And what they've said and done are sometimes different. But with that said, the language that they're using more recently seems to be stronger. And I'm curious, if we do see more price investment from them, would you use the 5%-off program as sort of a catchall to match them or essentially match them? Or would you be more compelled to match them on the item itself?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Our goal, Dan, is to be competitive with the value as well as the retail on all items. And our 5% REDcard Rewards is a loyalty program for the guests that have a credit or debit card. So in merchandising, we watch competitors very closely for their content, the quality, what's built into it, and of course, the retail. And we will be competitive.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. I don't know if I missed this. Did you give your best estimate on what inflation contributed to the overall sales growth?", "Douglas Scovanner", "No, we did not. I'm not sure that any retailer has the IT capabilities to give you a reliable figure on that.", "Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, and then my final question, if I could. The mix shift -- or the mix impact, I should say, was pretty impressive, I'd say, less than we would have expected, and you had some offsets in the gross margin that helped that along. As we think about it going forward, in a sort of a simplistic way, I realize, but can you give us sort of a rough idea of what you would think the sort of the base case would be for the mix shift? Is it 20-20-20 type impact from the core shift that we've normally seen and then 20 basis points each for the 5% and PFresh? Or is that too simplistic?", "Douglas Scovanner", "No, let me clarify. Let's go back to what I said in my remarks to understand the base case. When I talked about the impact on gross margin rate of mix and of rate within categories, the overall gross margin rate decline is 35 basis points. And I said that the mix impact was somewhat larger than that, slightly larger than that. And it was offset by rate within categories, and broadly, the 2 strategies combined drove most of that. Additionally, beyond the effect of the 2 strategies, there was some rate benefit within categories. So what does that mean? It means moving forward, we expect to continue to see some adverse mix due to those core integrated strategies, and there was some background adverse mix even before those strategies came along. But the mix impact is a PFresh impact, not by and large a 5% Rewards impact. So it isn't 20-20-20 even if you change different numbers. 5% Rewards has virtually no impact, tiny impact, on our consolidated mix statistics. So net-net, I would expect to continue to have adverse mix impacts partially offset by these rate effects, driven in large part by our integrated sales growth strategies. I would expect variations on the theme of the second quarter to be playing through our numbers for a long time to come.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Okay. Well, that concludes Target's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 16, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2011 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our third quarter results and strategic priorities going forward, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our third quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "We're very pleased with Target's third quarter financial results, which we released earlier this morning. We earned $0.82 per share in the third quarter, up more than 10% over last year's third quarter. This increase is particularly noteworthy because we're cycling an unusually low income tax rate in the third quarter of 2010, and this year's results includes $0.05 of dilution from our Canadian market investments. Adjusted for these 2 items, our EPS increased 28% over last year. ", "Our comparable store sales increased 4.3% in the quarter, reflecting our strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2007. This year's performance reflects the strength of our core Retail business, including the benefits of our remodel program and 5% REDcard Rewards, which are combining to drive meaningful sales momentum in an environment where many consumers are cutting trips and spending less. ", "Once again, our team did an outstanding job of maintaining the profitability of our Retail sales. Our merchant teams successfully managed gross margin rate within categories, creating an offset to most of the gross margin rate dilution we are experiencing as a result of our sales driving initiatives. And our store's team delivered another quarter of meaningful productivity improvement, contributing expense leverage while delivering great guest service. ", "And finally, again this quarter, we continued to benefit from the outstanding performance of our Credit Card portfolio as our financial services team delivered strong segment profit performance, overcoming the continued decline in the size of the portfolio. ", "I want to thank the entire Target team for their commitment to our brand and the energy they bring to work every day. Target's strong performance is the result of their innovative spirit and relentless focus on serving our guests. ", "Like many of you, we've been disappointed by the absence of any meaningful improvement in the economy so far this year as the most recent U.S. unemployment rate of 9% was unchanged from last January. Until the U.S. begins to see robust improvement in jobs and signs of recovery in the housing market, we believe consumer spending will likely continue to be soft and uneven, requiring retailers to carefully manage their expenses while finding innovative ways to drive profitable sales and market share. ", "Within this climate, we're pleased that through the first 3 quarters of 2011, we've grown comparable store sales more than 3% while enjoying more than 10% growth in earnings per share even while performing a record number of remodels, moving www.target.com onto our own platform, preparing to open our first City Target stores in 2012 and investing in our 2013 Canadian market entry strategy. ", "In the third quarter, we opened 6 new stores, completing our 2011 new store program. In addition, we remodeled another 133 stores in the quarter, meaning we now operate 875 general merchandise locations with an expanded food layout, including fresh food. Three years ago, this format was only a concept we were testing in 2 Minnesota stores. And in a very short time frame, it has become our core format, incorporating a more relevant assortment in a completely transformed environment that's visually compelling and easy to shop. ", "Late in the quarter, we marked our first anniversary of our nationwide launch of 5% REDcard Rewards, and this program continues to perform as expected. We're attracting new credit and debit cardholders who are already among our most loyal guests but for whom the ability to save an additional 5% every day causes them to become even more loyal, shopping more often and increasing their spending. ", "In addition, earlier this month, we launched our new REDcard free ship program, giving our current guests another reason to shop online with us more often this holiday season. ", "Looking ahead, we feel very confident about our holiday season marketing and merchandising plans, as Kathy will outline in a few minutes. We also expect this year's momentum to carry into next year as we continue to develop more ways to drive loyalty and engage with our guests in new ways. ", "We look forward to launching our City Target concept in 4 major metro areas in 2012, allowing urban guests to shop at a Target in their own neighborhood. We'll continue to enhance our Web strategy and offerings, providing guests a Target brand experience no matter when or how they choose to engage with us. And teams across the company are preparing to open Target stores in Canada beginning in early 2013, allowing Canadian guests to experience Target without crossing the border into the U.S. I am endlessly impressed with the energy of our team and the passion they share for our brand. Our store's teams are excited and ready to handle the holidays with Black Friday only 9 days away, and our online business and technology teams are working tirelessly to correct the issues that have arisen with the relaunch of www.target.com. We know we're not yet providing a consistent experience online, and we won't stop until these issues are resolved. ", "Finally, I'd like to comment on our recent announcement of Doug Scovanner's plan to retire as CFO of Target at the end of next March. Target shareholders have benefited from the outstanding financial performance under Doug's leadership, and he's been a valued and trusted colleague for 18 years. The timetable we laid out in our early November announcement is designed to provide sufficient time to carefully consider internal and external candidates to fill this critical role and to allow sufficient time for Doug and his successor to work together before the end of Doug's tenure as CFO of Target. ", "Separately, before Doug leaves, we intend to have some form of announcement regarding our intended sale of our Credit Card receivables. We continue to believe that the most likely form of such an announcement will be that we've reached an agreement with a buyer on both the terms of such a sale and on the nature of an ongoing arrangement with them as well. ", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on the second (sic) [third] quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline initiatives for the remainder of the year. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. We're very pleased with both the pace and mix of our third quarter sales. With our remodel program, we're becoming an even more trusted destination for our core guests, providing everyday needs at great prices along with outstanding value on trend-right content in apparel and home. ", "Across the chain, we've seen consistently strong sales in food, beauty, healthcare and other household essentials as guests respond to Target's great prices in a unique one-stop shopping environment. ", "On the more discretionary side of our business, we are pleased with our sales momentum in Apparel, which was led in the third quarter by a double-digit comp sales increase in Performance Activewear, featuring our C9 by Champion brand. ", "While trends have been slower in Home, we've seen steady improvement so far this year as comp sales in this category have strengthened every quarter. ", "Successful Back-to-School and Back-to-College campaigns drove third quarter performance in Housewares and seasonal categories, and we've been encouraged with recent sales spends in bedding, following our September reset. We believe we've positioned our Home category for continued improvement, but we expect progress will be slow and uneven in light of continued weakness in jobs and the housing market. ", "Our third quarter partnership with Missoni generated an amazing amount of buzz, and the guests' response on the day of the launch was unprecedented. Our largest collection to date created a frenzy, reminding some of Black Friday, as guests formed lines hours before some stores opened. Most stores sold out quickly in the first few days, and replenishment shipments sold out quickly throughout the month. ", "On www.target.com, Missoni demand created online traffic that outpaced any Black Friday or Cyber Monday in our history, putting a great deal of stress on our newly launched online platform. While we didn't anticipate putting our new site through such a dramatic test at such a young age, we are quickly moving forward to make improvements, applying what we've learned from the experience to implement hundreds of fixes that will elevate the guest experience and enhance stability. Moving to our own Web platform is part of a larger strategic commitment to enhance Target's multichannel capabilities, and we continue to devote significant resources in support of that commitment. ", "Our guest research continues to reflect the impact of a slow and uneven economic recovery on different income groups. The highest ", "[audio gap] ", "customers continue to shop more often and spend more at Target and elsewhere, while the vast majority of consumers are cutting trips and spending less. Recently, consumer confidence has fallen back to levels observed in 2008 and 2009, and optimism about the future has declined so far this year. Guests are worried about the economy and focus particularly on jobs, the housing market, government spending and debt. ", "Against this backdrop, we feel very good about the changes we've implemented to enhance our relevance in this challenging environment. As we remodel stores, we deepen our assortments in frequency categories, providing guests more reasons to shop at Target more often. And we continue to offer outstanding prices every day along with additional opportunities to save, including 5% REDcard Rewards, Pharmacy Rewards and our new REDcard free ship program. These efforts are clearly working, driving traffic increases in an environment where we'd otherwise expect traffic to decline. ", "While we expect guests to continue to spend cautiously as we head into the important fourth quarter, we're confident we have the marketing and merchandising plans in place to make us the top shopping destination for all our guests' holiday needs. Target will offer a variety of sale events both online and in stores throughout the season. As guests gear up for the biggest shopping day of the year, we're excited that Target stores will open at midnight on Black Friday 4 hours earlier than last year. And for the guests who want to get a head start on their holiday shopping, we'll again have our 4-day sale leading up to Black Friday. This Beat The Rush Sale is our biggest circular coupon event of the year and will include items in departments throughout the store. ", "Following our 2-day sale, target.com will have greatly discounted doorbuster deals across all categories on Cyber Monday and deals on thousands more throughout Cyber Week. Guests will be able to save even more on already discounted prices by using a REDcard. And as Gregg mentioned, guests now receive free shipping on every order from target.com when using a REDcard. ", "Just like 5% Rewards, we've designed this program to be simple. All target.com purchases using a REDcard ship free with no membership fee and no minimum purchase requirement. ", "Throughout the season, guests in our stores and on target.com will be delighted by our unique merchandise assortments in every department. Guests can find the perfect toy for everyone on their shopping list in our Target toy catalog. This year's catalog is 8 pages bigger than last year's and includes 48 coupons offering more than $350 in savings. ", "To make stocking stuffing easy, we'll have the most popular new movies and music, including exclusive albums from Beyonc\u00e9, Michael Bubl\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. Our Electronics assortment is stocked with all the most coveted tablets, cameras and video games. And in Home, we have all the pieces to make decorating and entertaining effortless this season, including throw pillows, candles and cookware. ", "We'll build excitement throughout the fourth quarter with headline-worthy designer collaborations. Earlier this month, we launched collections by Josie Natori in lingerie and loungewear, Dana Kellin in jewelry and Albertus Swanepoel in hats. Initial response has been positive, and these collections will be available throughout the holiday season. ", "The first installment of Gwen Stefani's highly anticipated Harajuku Mini for Target collection sat in stores this week. This exclusive collection starts at just $3.99 and features affordable fashion-forward Apparel & Accessories with a unique design aesthetic for infants, toddlers and tweens. ", "And we'll kick off 2012 with another exciting collaboration. Target is partnering with celebrated women's wear and accessories designer, Jason Wu, to create a limited edition collection of women's apparel, handbags and scarves. Jason Wu is one of the most influential designers in the fashion industry today, and we are excited to bring guests a collection that embodies his signature style at affordable prices. The collection will be available in early February 12, 2012 at most Target stores and on www.target.com. ", "In both our merchandising and marketing plans, we strive to support both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, and I'm pleased that these efforts are resonating with our guests. While we all hope that the economy continues to improve, we've developed initiatives that are driving traffic and loyalty today while positioning Target to succeed in a variety of economic conditions. ", "Now Doug will cover third quarter financial performance and provide details on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Doug?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide additional detail on Target's third quarter financial performance and provide more color on our outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond. ", "Our actual EPS of $0.82 reported earlier this morning set a new third quarter record by some measure, and as Gregg discussed, the adjusted EPS increase attributable to our 2 U.S. business segments was particularly robust in the quarter. ", "You'll notice that we included an additional table in our press release schedules this morning, in which we reconcile our reported EPS to an adjusted measure that I believe is highly useful in judging the results of our operations. We'll continue to include this table in the future to provide greater clarity around the impact of unique items that are also large enough to merit discrete analytical consideration. ", "The 2 matters that met these criteria today were the large and favorable state income tax settlements recorded and disclosed last year and the expenses recorded and disclosed this year related to our Canadian market entry. In the future, this table will include not only additional activity in these 2 categories, but also, for example, any income or expense directly or indirectly related to the intended sale of our accounts receivable if sufficiently large. As our results unfold over the next several years, this table will provide a framework for all of us to use in tracking Target's progress toward achieving $8 or more in EPS by 2017. ", "In the U.S. Retail segment, we enjoyed a third quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.3%, slightly above our second quarter performance and slightly above our expectation going into the quarter. This comp increase was driven primarily by an increase in average ticket, combined with a slight increase in same-store transactions or traffic. While we don't perform a comprehensive inflation analysis each quarter, it's clear that our average ticket currently reflects the impact of significant inflation in Apparel and Soft Home. ", "As you know, we've increased our retail prices in these categories in response to increases in our costs to acquire these goods. This means our dollar comps in these categories generally reflect fewer units sold at higher retail prices than we'd expect to see in an environment without such cost pressures. And as we expected, our guests have demonstrated a propensity to spend about the same dollar amounts through this period as they otherwise might have, essentially managing their household budgets by decreasing the number of units purchased. ", "U.S. Retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were higher than last year and favorable to our expectations going into the quarter. Our gross margin rate was down less than 20 basis points, reflecting about 30 basis points, driven by adverse sales mix, partially offset by gross margin rate favorability within categories. ", "Again this quarter, we enjoyed very healthy SG&A expense performance in the U.S. Retail segment as this segment benefited from the profit-sharing arrangement with our Credit Card segment, and importantly, our store teams led us to yet another year-over-year increase in store hourly labor productivity. ", "Between the EBITDA and EBIT lines, we enjoyed another 20 basis points of favorable depreciation and amortization leverage in the quarter, and as we've previously indicated, we expect to continue to benefit from a general tailwind of this kind for quite some time to come. ", "In the U.S. Credit Card segment, we continued to enjoy superstrong profitability, again driven by strong underlying performance augmented by substantial reductions in our accounts receivable allowance. Even with this latter benefit, our Credit Card segment profit increased only modestly in the quarter, as this quarter represents the first of many to follow in which we'll cycle against very large reserve releases in prior periods. I'll elaborate on this issue in more detail as I discuss our outlook in a few minutes. ", "Consistent with our expectations, the results of our Canadian segment included $18 million of start-up expenses and $17 million of depreciation and amortization in the third quarter. In addition, about $15 million of third quarter consolidated interest expense recorded outside the segment was attributable to Canadian leases. ", "Combined with a moderately lower Canadian tax rate, in the aggregate, these expenses contributed about $0.05 of EPS dilution in the third quarter, in line with our guidance of $0.05 to $0.06. ", "Also in the third quarter, we made our final payment to Zellers, and we've now disclosed the number and locations of all of the leases we've chosen in this transaction. In total, we exercised our lease options on 189 Zellers locations. After accounting for lease rights sold or transferred to developers and other retailers, we continue to expect to open 125 to 135 of these locations as new Target stores, with most stores opening in 2013. ", "We finalized our purchase accounting in the quarter, allocating just over USD $1.6 billion of net lease acquisition premium to the acquired stores. Separately, we've capitalized about $1.3 billion related to the assumption of the underlying leases. Combined, these Canadian investments of $2.9 billion represent the majority of our consolidated year-over-year increase in net property plant and equipment. ", "We also invested about $226 million in share repurchase this quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to about $1.7 billion. We continue to retire shares under our share repurchase program at a far faster pace than we issue shares under our stock-based compensation plans. As a result, our net shares outstanding at quarter end were 5.2% lower than this time last year. ", "In light of our realistic growth prospects, we believe our shares continue to represent compelling value, and as a result, we plan to continue to augment our cash dividends by returning cash to shareholders in this manner. ", "As Gregg mentioned, we recently celebrated the first anniversary of our national rollout of 5% REDcard Rewards, and our results continue to meet our very high expectations. In the third quarter, REDcard penetration, that is the percentage of our sales on REDcards, increased 4 full percentage points versus last year, with the increase about evenly split between our credit card and debit card core groups. ", "In the second year of the program, we expect to benefit from another meaningful increase in penetration as more and more of our better and best guests ask us to issue these cards, and once in wallet, use them to shop in our stores and online with sharply higher frequency. ", "Now let's turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond. In our U.S. Retail segment, our outlook envisions fourth quarter same-store sales performance in line with or slightly below that of the last 2 quarters, at around 4% or a little less. We expect our U.S. Retail segment EBIT margin rate will be quite close to last year's fourth quarter experience, driven by a familiar and comfortable recipe, modest gross margin rate deterioration fully offset by rate favorability on each of the SG&A and depreciation and amortization expense lines. ", "In our U.S. Credit Card segment, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2012. Realistically, though, as we cycle against prior-year periods in which our results were greatly enhanced by accounts receivable allowance reductions, we are very unlikely to continue to report increases in segment profit. ", "Premium performance in this segment used to be defined by an annualized pretax ROIC performance in the mid to upper teens, and this is the level of performance we believe we're likely to enjoy for the next several quarters and beyond, subject only to modest quarterly seasonality. ", "In our conference call 6 months ago, we laid out our expectations for expenses related to our Canadian market entry for the rest of the year. At that time, we discussed our expectation that the full year impact of these expenses would likely equate to $0.16 to $0.20 in EPS terms. We continue to believe that our annual result will lie in this range, more likely toward the upper end, driven by somewhat higher fourth quarter expenses and slightly lower expenses year-to-date compared with earlier expectations. ", "Specifically, we now expect the fourth quarter dilution related to our Canadian market entry will be $0.07 to $0.09 per share, putting the full year impact at about $0.18 to $0.20 per share. ", "The current median First Call estimate for Target's fourth quarter EPS is $1.48. From our perspective, this is a reasonable single-point estimate within a range of potential outcomes as evidenced by the range of $1.43 to $1.53 we provided in this morning's press release. At the midpoint of this range, we would earn about $4.32 for the year, driven by over $4.50 in the U.S. Either way you measure it, these figures are well above our expectations as we entered the year, reinforcing our confidence in the likelihood of generating $8 or more in EPS by 2017, enabling us to pay an annualized dividend per share of $3 or more at that time. ", "One final clarification. The guidance I've outlined does not include the benefit of favorable resolution of yet more state income tax matters, which we currently estimate will be in the neighborhood of $50 million in the fourth quarter. Also, this guidance does not reflect any potential direct or indirect impacts from a potential Credit Card receivables sale transaction, including the potential for extinguishment of the 2008 Chase Card Services transaction, which we have the right to prepay in whole on or before January 31st by also paying to Chase what amounts to a may-call premium. ", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We're very pleased with our third quarter financial results, and we expect our current momentum to carry into the fourth quarter. Our remodel program and 5% REDcard Rewards are driving profitable sales in an environment where consumers continue to be very cautious. ", "We expect to continue to benefit from these initiatives in the fourth quarter and into 2012 as we open our first City Target stores and prepare to open Canadian Targets in 2013. ", "That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Doug, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.", "Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I was just curious if you could give us a little bit of color on what your promotional posture will look like this holiday season versus last year.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, I'll take that one, Dan. This is Kathy. The fourth quarter is extremely competitive, and so far this year, our pricing has been spot on. We've been really pleased with how competitive our prices have been. And of course, with the 5% Rewards, our guests get an even greater deal. So we believe it will be competitive this year just as it has been in past years, and we believe our pricing will measure up.", "Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "If I could just follow up. I was curious, Doug, if you could just give us a little bit of color on how you would expect PFresh and 5% Rewards to contribute now that we're going to the second holiday season with it both from a sales and margin standpoint?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, first with respect to 5% Rewards, as you know, we piloted this concept in Kansas City for a full year before we rolled it out nationally, so Kansas City, have to see the twinkle in my eye, will always be one year ahead of the rest of the U.S. In our second year in Kansas City, we've had pretty meaningful increase year-over-year, not as large as year one but still quite meaningful. So moving forward for the next 4 quarters, still expect a couple of hundred basis points or better year-over-year increase in penetration. There is seasonality to this program so the benefit will be lower in Q4 than we expect it to be Q1, Q2, Q3 next year but continuing through year 2 in all likelihood and well beyond year 2 in terms of its year-over-year benefit. PFresh, a smaller benefit, of course, because of the nature of the program and also subject to seasonality, which makes it a little smaller contributor in Q4 than Q1, 2, 3. And for those 2 reasons, seasonality in each of those programs, that's why I believe that more likely our Q4 same-store sales could trail the last few quarters of experience by a small amount.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. The first was just on gross margin and the outlook there. The rate improvements, could you maybe talk a little bit about the rate improvements that you saw within categories? And was that primarily less clearance-driven year-over-year on your tight inventory management or is there something else that you figured out? And then the second question is, Doug, I think you talked about the Apparel and Softlines inflation being significant. Can you maybe give us some view into 2012 on whether that inflation benefit -- the comp that you saw in the third quarter, if that starts to anniversary as you move through the first half or second half of next year and how you guys are thinking about that?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "So I'll take the first one, Robby, on gross margin. As you know, our goal has been to maintain gross margin within categories or to improve it. And obviously, the team's done a fantastic job of that. Part of that, as you mentioned, was great inventory control. Certainly, optimizing our markdowns has helped. And then I would say in Home and Apparel, the team has been very thoughtful about how to offset some of those cost increases. And as we've talked earlier, there's a number of contributing factors to that. One is our standardizing of fabric, which gets us better quality and consistency, but we're also able to aggregate yardage and get better pricing. And then the work that the team has done in garment design and technical to make sure that we're taking out costs wherever that's appropriate. And then lastly, where appropriate, we have passed on some of those cost increases. So while our pricing in the marketplace is really rock solid, we've been able to improve on our gross margin.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes. This is Gregg. I'll tackle the inflation question. First of all, we really don't get the comp benefit from the inflation that we've experienced because as Doug mentioned in his remarks, the units are down, commensurate with what the inflation is in those primarily non-discretionary categories. So in a general sense, what's happening is the high -- or the higher inflation in cost inputs, that has mitigated somewhat, and as we turn the corner and we go into 2012, we believe we will experience far less inflation than we did in the second and third quarters and fourth quarters of 2011, but it will still be slightly higher than where we were as we entered 2011.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I know we're a bit of a broken record on this topic, but we've always believed that the impact of inflation on the way up and on the way down is much likely much lower than many of you on this phone call believe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up on the units versus price and the outlook for the fourth quarter. That sort of 4% comp or maybe a little less, is that what you guys bought for 3 or 6 months ago when you were planning for holiday or has something else changed in the consumer environment to make that shift a little bit? And I have a follow-up.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Nothing's changed, it's exactly what we bought for.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "All right. So then the follow-up is, Doug, you mentioned on the credit. It was very helpful as to how that starts to cycle. Would you expect that we've reached that point where the provisions on the balance sheet and bad debt expense sort of at that absolute dollar number now just has to stabilize given that the delinquencies are stabilizing? Is that the way to think about it?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "We're getting very close to the point where they'll be stabilized. I'd certainly leave the door cracked open to the potential for a much more modest receivables allowance reduction in Q4 than we've experienced. Certainly within the next several quarters, we're likely to reach that equilibrium. Again, the underlying performance of the portfolio remains quite strong. We'll simply move into a period where we will no longer experience the turbocharging impact of those receivables allowance reductions, certainly not to the same extent. And given the fact that the portfolio is, of course, smaller than it was a year ago, those factors will combine to produce segment profit lower than prior year actuals, even though segment profit will highly likely remain fully, fully adequate in light of the capital we have invested in that segment.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then Gregg or Kathy, on the dotcom, given some of the challenges at the launch and Missoni, all that going on at once, do you have a team in place now to actually fix dotcom? Or do we expect to be adding more people or maybe building it up some more?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we believe that the platform is stable. We are in the process of building out that team and adding more resources to that team. We have been doing that all along. We very shortly will be naming a leader of that team, but we have gone through -- we've made a tremendous amount of fixes as you can imagine with a replatforming effort of this magnitude. We really took a 3-year program and did it in just over 2 years. And so we fully expected to have some issues coming out of the changeover. And we've had that amount of issues and more. So we feel confident we've got the right amount of resources, the capital that we're spending to make those fixes as well as the team members in place to make great progress going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First on the fourth quarter comps, you talked about 4% or less. If you could shed some light on the monthly cadence, given some pretty wide swings that you're lapping a year ago, the tough November, easy December, the extra day in December. If you could provide any sort of clarification on how we should think about on a month-to-month basis in the quarter, that'd be helpful.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "We don't expect to experience the same degree of volatility month-to-month this year that we experienced last year. And therefore, if you're thinking of something like a 2-year stack, we would expect November to be stronger than December.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And is that also sort of inclusive of trends you've seen month-to-date?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Month-to-date, we're right in line with where we expected, so right in line with an experience that supports the comment I made a minute ago. Let's please remember, though, that even though we're halfway through the month in elapsed time, we're not even remotely close to halfway through the month in elapsed sales. So most of the forecast for November lies ahead of us.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure, appreciate that. And then the second, on the margin commentary, if you could -- the favorability that you're seeing in a category basis, maybe shed some light on the merchandise margin, what that -- what's the performance there? And then going forward, Doug, your comments on the guidance, modest gross margin rate deterioration. As we've seen the adverse mix shift seemingly moderate over the last few quarters and you're lapping a reasonably easy year ago comparison on the gross margin, kind of help us think about why we should expect some deterioration? Is that some of the REDcard free shipping, some of the new initiatives that could drive some of the contraction there?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, year-over-year, we continue to have pretty meaningful layer of 5% Rewards and a pretty meaningful layer of the impact of our PFresh initiative. So even though it might be moderating, to use your word, it's still adverse to gross margin rate. Separately, looking back into the third quarter, there's no doubt that our gross margin rate performance within categories exceeded our expectations going into the quarter. So stir all that together, when I've remarked about a familiar recipe, what I meant to describe is a circumstance where we'll continue to see gross margin rate deterioration. In Q4, I would expect it to be a little higher than what we experienced in Q3. Separately, we expect to continue to benefit in Q4 and beyond from the benefit of favorable SG&A leverage and favorable depreciation and amortization leverage. Our outlook for Q4 at this point is that those 2 expense-related benefits will be in line with maybe, a little larger, maybe a little less, than the gross margin rate deterioration, and that's why we think that EBIT margin rates in Q4 will likely be in line with last year's rate, plus or minus. Important to emphasize EBIT, obviously. With the depreciation and amortization benefit even year-over-year on EBIT would imply a slight deterioration in EBITDA.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And just to circle back on the gross margin, putting with your comments earlier that seasonally the REDcard is a little bit seasonally lower in the fourth quarter, appreciate there's an adverse hit from REDcard and PFresh. But it's in the fourth quarter, that's a little bit lighter seasonally. Maybe help us understand the greater deterioration?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Again, we experienced greater benefit from margin rate improvements within categories in Q3 than we expected. That is the single largest offsetting factor.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then maybe, Gregg, you mentioned obviously the announcement on Doug and the change of the management. There's obviously been other announcements, Michael Francis and online. Maybe just help us think about the timing in terms of assembling the new team. How should we be thinking about what the complexion, what sort of the skill set, what sort of -- what Target will look like going forward in terms of the executive rank?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes. I'm not really going to address the timing of this because the timing will come when it's appropriate. We have a very deep and talented bench. Clearly, Doug's retirement was a planned event, and we have great internal team members. We have a team of 355,000 strong. But we're also going to take an opportunity to look on the outside as well to make sure that we get absolutely the best individual in any of these positions that are open right now. So stay tuned. Timing is undefined, but I think the most short-term decision that you'll hear from us will be filling our multichannel and dotcom position and then the others will come after that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Two quickly. First just on the free shipping that you're offering with the REDcards, where does that hit in the P&Ls? Probably not super material, but I just wanted to kind of understand where that would hit. And then secondly, Walmart obviously talking a lot about making incremental price investments in their business right now and going forward. I guess my question is where are you seeing that show up in your business right now, if at all? And has that reality kind of changed your planning processes for the holiday and beyond?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I'll tackle your first question, and Kathy will tackle the second one. Free shipping will show up year-over-year as a decrease in gross margin rate. Given the magnitude of this one, I doubt that it'll be one of the -- I doubt that it would be one of the larger items in explaining our fourth quarter year-over-year. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "On the pricing side, we have not seen it show up yet at Walmart. Certainly they are competitive in their pricing as they always are, but there are not any more rollbacks today. In fact, there's a few less. And their discount is on par with where they have been historically. So of course, we watch that very carefully, and we will adjust our prices as appropriate. But so far, we haven't seen an impact.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, I think, Peter, what you're going to see from virtually all of our retailers is that everybody is focused on winning on price and making price investments, and they're going to talk about that broadly and loudly. And that's the primary tactic of Walmart. So it's consistent with what they have done as they lead into a Back-to-School or Back-to-College season or in the fourth quarter. They typically talk about the price investment they're going to make. They're a very aggressive retailer, and they have a lot of good deals. But it doesn't -- it's not all that different compared to where they've been in the past.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-up. On, and you may have mentioned this, but the fourth quarter comp view, what does that envision for traffic? Are you guys thinking transaction count is flat or slightly down, slightly up? That would be helpful.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "We don't forecast at that level of precision.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.", "Shane Palahicky", "This is Shane on the line for Deb today. I just thought maybe I just wanted to take a quick look at Canada. With you guys that kind of putting the real estate portion of it kind of behind you, I just wanted to kind of see where you guys are in terms of the kind of market entry and that execution and also kind of talk about your relationship with Sobeys and how that's going?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, from a market entry standpoint, we're right in line with all of our previous disclosures. We expect to open 125 to 135 stores resulting from the Zellers transaction. We are busily at work trying to identify additional sites to augment the sites that came about from the Zellers transaction. The majority of those will open in 2013. Some of them, the more complicated projects, especially ones that involve building expansions, likely 2014, not 2013. So from my standpoint, we're spot on where we would have expected to be. Gregg, do you want to comment on the Sobeys relationship?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, we're excited about the Sobeys relationship. There isn't really a lot to share at this point in time. I mean, we're developing a partnership with them as we are other key third-party providers as part of our Canadian market entry strategy. We're working hard right now in building out our team. We're working on our supply chain, both physically and the replenishment aspects of that and then the technology platform. So we know we've got a very good team in place. We're working very fast and furiously to make sure that we're ready to go, and we open our first cycle of stores in Q1 of 2013.", "Shane Palahicky", "And so just on that technology side, are you guys using some of the technology that you have in the States or does it have to be a kind of totally different platform?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We're using a different platform. We're using the SAP platform in Canada. Now we are also using an SAP platform for a portion of our business here domestically in the United States.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "But effectively, you should think of this as a blank sheet of paper approach, building from scratch.", "Operator", ".", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. One, Gregg, in terms of e-commerce, just following up on that, given that, that business has likely experienced some deterioration in growth the last few quarters, what has been the comp impact from e-commerce this year versus last year? Is that -- thinking about this as you get some of these things fixed in terms of the technology, is that a comp opportunity next year? And then also, Kathy, refining the question about the competitive environment a little bit, I'm thinking about toys and electronics as 2 potential categories of share gain this year, just given the comparisons from last year. Do you view those the same way as opportunities? And is anything happening competitively with Walmart in terms of their approach to toys, for example, that would make your share recapture more challenging?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, the comp impact even before we entered the period of a transformation was relatively immaterial. And as you point out, there's been a slight deceleration during this time frame. As we fix and become more experienced with the site, we expect to get back to where we were in the past. But overall, it is not a meaningful layer on top of our store-based business at this time in terms of comp impact.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "And Jeff, to answer your question on the competition in particularly in Toys and Electronics, yes, of course, we go into every year trying to grow our market share. I would tell you Toys is off to a slow start, and I think that's going to be a bit of an uphill climb for us this year, although we're still optimistic about the rest of the fourth quarter. Our in stocks are fabulous. Our toy catalog is great. We have over $350 of coupons in that catalog, so more to be seen on that. And then in terms of Electronics, we are feeling pretty confident. We've seen good results so far. It's been strengthening as the year's gone on. And the categories that are great for gift giving are ones that we're strong in. So whether that's e-readers or iPads or the iPod, we've got a lot of strength there.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Kathy, what do you think it is in Toys that's presenting the challenge this season?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, I think Walmart Layaway program has certainly hurt us in November. It still remains to be seen if that continues or if that is just a November issue. But I also think guests are still researching. We see a lot of that on our own site, researching what it is they want to buy. And so we haven't really seen the season kick off yet.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "I'd also add, Jeff, and I think you're see a little bit of the early Black Friday hype in the fact that in these more seasonally sensitive categories, the more people talk about Black Friday, the more of a perception that there is that perhaps, broadly, you can wait on some of these categories because the deals are going to get better, which really isn't true. But there is a perception out there, and there's a lot of discussion and a lot of other retailers release their Black Friday ads early, and so there is some comparison shopping going on. And unfortunately, it's amounting to doing more business in a shorter period of time, but that's just the way the market place has evolved.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just 2 quick follow-ups. First on Canada, what was driving the somewhat higher fourth quarter estimate of the operating start-up costs there? And in general, how are you progressing with hiring? So that's the first question. And then second, on credit, it looks like the net write-off ratio of 5.7% is approaching some of the lowest charge-off ratios that, that business has really ever experienced. With the better credit quality of the REDcard holders, where would you expect that to be bottoming out?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "First on the Canada side, from our point of view, we're dealing with a fairly trivial timing issue. Given the precision with which our Canada efforts are being followed, I understand why this is -- I understand partially why this is a matter of such keen interest. I would say that from a timing standpoint, it's in the SG&A side of the equation, not depreciation, amortization or interest expense. There, we have a combination of legal expenses, wages and benefits and consulting expenses, and those are certainly difficult to pin down with great precision. Put in round numbers, I'd say looking forward, you should expect to see maybe a $20 million increase, give or take, in the segment in Q4, and additionally, the Q3 interest expense of $15 million as a part quarter impact of the last round of stores, so maybe that rises to $20 million or so. So in the aggregate, that takes you to kind of the single-point estimate that's in the middle of our $0.07 to $0.09 a share in the quarter. On your question regarding credit quality, yes, certainly, the accounts that we have underwritten in the past couple of years, even beginning quite a bit earlier than the national rollout of 5% Rewards, are accounts that we would or vintages that we would expect to mature at somewhat lower write-off rates than prior vintages. By the way, we're only focusing on the write-offs, so that means they're also likely to mature at somewhat lower gross finance charge revenue yields than prior vintages. But sticking with the write-off rate discussion, hard to predict exactly where the net write-off rate will balance, will optimize, but we're clearly on track to have it balanced at levels that will test or go beyond, in a favorable sense, go beyond where we have ever been before.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "On the Canadian hiring front, it is going as we have planned thus far. We have worked hard at defining our employment brand. We've been on campus. We've been talking about Target and the employment opportunities both in the stores and in our field operations and at headquarters. We have a lot of positions to hire. This is going to be a Canadian company run by Canadians, and so we're spending a lot of time making sure that we educate the Canadians that we're looking to hire. We're spending a lot of time with casual get-togethers. We're on campus. We made offers. Our acceptance rate has been very good so far. So we're feeling good with where we are right now. We know that this will be an ongoing endeavor for us as we bring people on and sequence them over the next 12 months. So, so far, so good. We've got a great team up in Canada already, and they're really doing an outstanding job, and we're excited that many Canadians are really, really interested in coming to work for Target. So, so far, there's been a lot of interest in Target, and we take that as a very good sign.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And then finally, Doug, congratulations on your pending retirement. Would you care to use this public forum to maybe discuss that decision a little?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "It is a decision that I did not take lightly. It's something that I've been looking forward to for quite some time. My head remains very deeply in this equation here at Target. And I intend to make this transition as smooth as I possibly can in handing the baton over to my successor.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions for me. First, on the more mature PFresh stores, have you been able to tweak the store offerings and marketing to drive fill-in trips at all? And then the second question I have is could you elaborate a little bit more on the improvement that you've experienced in the Home category and what you've seen there?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes. We're pleased with our performance in PFresh stores as we cycle. And as we add more and more stores, when we get market density, we're able to market more broadly to the market rather than just geotargeting the marketing around the stores that are opening. So now that we have good density, you're going to see more broad marketing campaigns, market-by-market. Year 2 performance is still performing as planned. We're making changes and adjustments in terms of mix and space within the store, very typical to what we would normally do when we make a change of this magnitude, and we continue to see good results in year 2 in our PFresh stores.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "And in terms of Home, we continue to make progress in our Home business even though this is the most discretionary area of our store. As I said earlier, we had a very strong Back-to-School, Back-to-College. Our Housewares and Stationery business has been very solid, and we're also making progress in discretionary areas like Domestics and Decorative Home. So we believe that the changes we've made, both in assortment and presentation, position us for continued success in Home, but I would tell you that we still see that progress will be a bit slow and uneven given the economic conditions that we're in.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then just my last question is, during the quarter, did the Missoni launch in business meaningfully impact the comp or the gross margin that's worth calling out on the numbers?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, certainly both directly and indirectly, those were both benefits. But to the quarter's aggregate numbers, not at all meaningful.", "Okay, we have time for one more call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on Bob's Home question. It was positive in September. I know you mentioned Back-to-School and Back-to-College, and then it slowed down again. Could you maybe talk about how much Missoni helped Home in that month versus perhaps the halo effect of traffic as you brought in a lot of excitement to the stores? And then bigger picture, do you think there's any read-through about who is shopping the Home category, the 95% or the other time outside of when you have the traffic event that Missoni was?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "I'll take the first layer of that one and Kathy can follow up for clarity. First of all, I think, certainly as everyone is aware, we have a huge and hugely profitable Home business, and I think in our zeal to be precise, we may have inadvertently misled a little bit. When results year-over-year are essentially flat and they're slightly better than flat and we say favorable and about $1.52 worse than flat, we say lower than prior, we're just crossing over an interesting boundary, but sales were neither hugely positive in September nor hugely negative afterward. I would call the whole period and individual components flat, flat to prior on a huge and hugely profitable business.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "And in terms of the guests that shop in Home, I would tell you it's the same guest that has been shopping in Home, and particularly is our best guest, better and best guest. I think the changes that we've made in presentation about merchandising by component instead of by brand, has helped make the category a bit more compelling. And then just the content itself, you've seen us reinvent our own brands. Room Essentials was the first one, Smith & Hawken, we launched a little over a year ago, and Target Home has been evolving. So I think that's where we're starting to gain some strength. Clearly, we've had strength on our good brands and best brands, and it's been increasing on the better side.", "Gregg W.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2011 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Mulligan, Senior Vice President, Treasury and Accounting, who as we announced last month, will succeed Doug as EVP and CFO beginning April 1.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, along with our strategic priorities in 2012, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. Doug will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial performance and progress toward our long-term financial goals. And finally, John Mulligan will provide our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening today to our comments today via webcast.

Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "We are pleased with Target's full year financial results, which reflect the ability of our teams to manage our businesses in an up and down environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share, which we report as a measure of the performance of our U.S. businesses, were $1.49 per share this year, up 8.3% from 2010. For the year in total, our adjusted earnings per share were $4.41, up 14.3% from a year ago.", "For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales increased 2.2%, more than a percentage point below our expectation as we entered the quarter. This shortfall was concentrated in the peak of the holiday season as promotional activity throughout Retail was exceptionally intense, and we chose to maintain an appropriate balance between driving sales and profitability. Post-holiday, the pace of our sales returned to the much stronger pre-holiday pace, and we've seen sales momentum build, particularly in discretionary categories. Against that backdrop, our teams did an outstanding job maintaining the business, controlling fourth quarter inventory and maintaining our operating margin rates at healthy levels.", "For the full year, we grew our comparable store sales by 3%, our best annual performance since 2007. This growth reflects investments made in our remodel program and 5% Rewards loyalty program, both of which continue to drive incremental traffic and sales. These strategies make Target a more desirable shopping destination and enhance guest loyalty, both of which are critical for our long-term success.", "As you all know, last year's macroeconomic environment was less than robust due to slow GDP growth, persistent high unemployment, housing weakness and stagnant incomes, particularly for lower and middle class consumers. Both our PFresh remodels and 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program were particularly valuable in this environment, allowing us to maintain positive traffic and growing our comparable store sales in line with our long-term financial goals.", "For the year, our teams did a great job of managing the profitability of our Retail sales, largely offsetting the gross margin pressure from our sales driving initiatives through expense leverage. This discipline kept our operating margins in line with our goal and past performance, while maintaining strong service levels in our stores.", "And for both the quarter and the year, the Credit Card team did an outstanding job managing our receivables portfolio, generating outstanding profitability on a planned decline in the asset base. Of course, beyond the profits directly measured in our Credit Card segment, our credit and debit cards serve as the platform for our 5% Rewards and REDcard Free Shipping loyalty programs.", "In our Canadian segment, we reached the halfway point between the commitment to expand into Canada and our expected store openings in spring 2013, and I'm very pleased with our progress. We have a strong executive team in place at our new headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, and we continue to hire talented team members who will help bring the Target brand to life for our Canadian guests.", "In addition, we're building 3 distribution centers across Canada, and we recently hosted our first all-day joint planning session with the Canadian vendor community to familiarize them with the Target brand and our expectations and begin developing the foundation for our joint business planning process.", "While it has certainly been a volatile year for both the economy and our businesses, our teams have stayed rock solid, with consistent execution and a passionate commitment to our brand and our guests. Our team is the foundation of our ability to generate strong financial performance and a world-class brand.", "Looking ahead, we believe the pace of economic recovery will continue to be slow and uncertain. We've been encouraged by recent improvements in some key economic measures, and we're pleased with the pace of our sales since the holiday season. Yet we expect we'll continue to see mixed signals in the economy going forward. We're continuing to plan our business appropriately, maintaining flexibility to chase business if we see more robust improvement in jobs, housing and household income. Yet, even our base case assumption of a continued slow and uneven recovery would allow us to stay on track to achieve our long-term financial goals of $100 billion or more in sales and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017.", "As we look ahead to 2012, we expect to open 20 to 25 stores, adding 15 to 20 locations, net of relocations and closures. Including in this new store plan are 5 CityTarget stores which will begin opening in July. While these slightly smaller urban stores will incorporate the Target brand and store experience, we'll tailor our assortment to meet the needs of the trade area and adapt our operating routines to work in smaller spaces with higher traffic.", "Our initial group of pilot locations will allow us to further optimize assortments and refine processes, enabling these stores to operate at peak efficiency. We plan to take time to learn from these stores before we determine the appropriate pace of investment and number of additional CityTarget stores we'll open over the next few years. In addition, we'll apply what we learn in these pilot stores across the chain in our larger U.S. stores and in Canada.", "In 2012, we'll continue to remodel existing general merchandise locations, adding perishable food along with a deeper assortment of dry, dairy and frozen items and enhanced store layout and presentation in areas including apparel, home, beauty, shoes and baby. Our teams performed a record number of these remodel projects in 2011, completing nearly 400 and bringing us to a total of nearly 900 general merchandise stores. This year, we expect to complete approximately 230 more general merchandise remodels in the U.S., bringing us to more than 1,100 stores by the end of the year.", "Additionally, we'll continue to selectively remodel a number of Super Target locations and expect to complete approximately 10 of those projects this year.", "In 2012, we'll also continue to enhance guest loyalty with programs like 5% Rewards and REDcard Free Shipping. Penetration of sales on our debit and credit cards continue to run well ahead of the year ago and has now reached a level beyond any point in our history. Penetration in the Kansas City market, which launched 5% Rewards a year ahead of the rest of the country, is still growing and well ahead of the rest of the chain, giving us a high degree of confidence that this program will continue to be a meaningful growth driver in 2012 and beyond.", "Beyond these large initiatives, Kathy and her team are focused on driving excitement for our assortments, turning well-designed merchandise from partners like Jason Wu and Missoni, with a guest experience that's unique in Retail. We know that we need to continue to stay fresh and innovative, becoming even stronger as a destination for great style and design. Kathy will provide more specifics in a few minutes.", "And of course, we continue to devote meaningful resources to our multichannel efforts. Our teams continue to work diligently, implementing hundreds of fixes to target.com to address issues that have emerged since the launch of our new platform last fall. As a result of these efforts, performance metrics for the site have already meaningfully improved.", "We're planning multiple additional releases this spring to continue enhancing the website, and I can assure you that there is no higher priority for this management team than to bring a great experience to our guests of target.com, just as we put the highest priority on the guest experience in our stores.", "Finally, selling our Credit Card receivables portfolio to the right partner at the right time on appropriate terms continues to be one of our top priorities. Our announcement in January that we're taking a pause in our efforts did not reflect a change in our desired outcome, but only in our thinking around the timing of a potential transaction.", "John Mulligan, Terry Scully and our finance and Credit Card teams expect to once again engage with potential partners later this year, with the goal of concluding an agreement with a partner by a year from now. In addition, Doug will be available as a resource in these discussions until his part-time engagement with us ends in early November.", "Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to thank Doug Scovanner for his tireless work on behalf of Target and our shareholders. Doug and I have worked closely for 18 years now, and he has been a trusted colleague throughout that time. Doug has always maintained that it's his desire to retire young, and despite my efforts to try and talk him out of it, he has stayed true to that goal. Both Doug and his contributions will be missed, but he has developed a talented finance team and an outstanding successor in John Mulligan, and I am highly confident John will uphold this company's tradition of having a superior CFO who is a strategic thinker and trusted partner to the CEO and broader leadership team.  Additionally, Target's commitment to financial discipline and shareholder value creation remains as steadfast as ever.", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on fourth quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline initiatives for 2012 and beyond. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. As you know, competitive intensity reached an all-time high during the holiday season. Research indicates that across retail, 2 out of 3 holiday season purchases in gift-giving categories were on some sort of promotion, and these promotional discounts were significant, ranging from 25% in some categories to more than 50% in others.", "Against that backdrop, I'm very pleased that we came into the season with a conservative position, allowing Target to offer compelling value without the need to desperately participate in an unprofitable race to unload excess inventory. We ended the season clean, and we're pleased that our sales trends reverted to a more normal pattern following the holiday.", "The margin mix of our fourth quarter sales was solid and in line with the rest of the year. Among need-based categories, Grocery continues to lead the way with double-digit comps as we continue to add square footage in our remodeled stores, and our general merchandise guests increasingly associate Target with food.", "Beauty and apparel led our discretionary categories in both the fourth quarter and the year. In apparel, we've seen particular strength in boys and girls and Performance Activewear, both signature businesses for Target. Home was down slightly for the quarter, consistent with third quarter results, with stronger results in Housewares and seasonal categories. Hardlines comps were the most challenging in both the fourth quarter and the full year. These industries are experiencing soft secular trends overall, and fourth quarter promotional intensity was the most severe in these categories.", "Our sales throughout 2011 reflected the impact of cost inflation, primarily in apparel, soft, home and food. As expected, we've been able to generally maintain gross margin rates within these categories by managing costs, and when necessary, raising retail prices. Also as expected, guests have maintained their dollar spending by purchasing fewer units in categories that saw retail price increases. Recently, costs have begun to level off, and as we look ahead to 2012, we believe our guests will continue to achieve a balance between units and price, maintaining their dollar spending within their household budgets.", "As we look at the impact of our 2 large growth initiatives in 2011, it's clear that we are successfully leading our existing guests to become increasingly loyal and engaged. Even prior to the launch of 5% Rewards, our REDcard guests were among our better and best guests, shopping more often, spending more at Target and shopping a greater number of categories each trip. Since the launch of this new loyalty program, each of these metrics has improved, making REDcard guests even more valuable.", "With our store remodels, we create a more relevant assortment which invites our guests to make more of their shopping trips with us, and they've responded, adding trips and sustaining that higher frequency over time. Initially, these extra trips tend to focus more on food and commodity categories, but over time, these trips expand to more of the store.", "Programs like these, which deepen the relationship with our guests, continue to sustain our sales performance in an environment where moderate income households are cutting trips and spending. Data from 2011 indicates that we held or gained wallet share across multiple guest segments, but we gained the most wallet share from our already better and best guests, demonstrating the power of these programs.", "As we look to 2012, we'll continue to drive growth with existing programs and look for new ways to drive loyalty like our REDcard Free Shipping program, which we launched in the fourth quarter. In 2012, we're expanding our Pharmacy Rewards program beyond REDcard members in an effort to build greater loyalty among our current pharmacy guests. Like 5% Rewards, Pharmacy Rewards is a powerful tool for generating additional trips and sales across our assortments. By expanding this incentive program to non-cardholders, we expect to bring millions more guests to the program, generating incremental traffic and sales.", "Beyond loyalty programs, our merchant teams are constantly striving to bring guests the right assortment of trusted national brands, high-quality own brands and a steady stream of surprises with Target exclusives and limited time-only partnerships. Over time, we've engaged in more than 80 unique design partnerships, elevating our brand while creating a sense of urgency and excitement for our guests.", "Following up on our Missoni for Target collection last fall, we've been very pleased with the results of our collection with acclaimed designer, Jason Wu. The guest response was incredibly strong as they lined up outside of Target stores across the country the morning of the launch.", "We're also giving guests in Canada a chance to shop this amazing collection. As we announced last week, today, Target opened a one-day only Jason Wu for Target pop-up store in Toronto. The event, which includes a private, media and influencer gathering and consumer shopping experience is Target's first brand activation in Canada.", "Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Mini for Target collection has proven a big success in both generating buzz and driving sales. We launched this collection of affordable Apparel & Accesories for infants, toddlers and tweens in November and added more content at the end of December. Additional collections will be made available throughout the year.", "World-renowned actress, singer and best-selling children's author, Julie Andrews, in collaboration with Target and The Walt Disney Company, is launching the first National Princess Week beginning April 22 in Target stores and online at target.com. We'll feature an array of Disney Princess merchandise, including apparel, toys, books, CDs, movies, personal care items and stationary, many of which are exclusive and will highlight beloved princess characters such as Ariel, Cinderella and Snow White.", "In music, we partnered with Grammy award winner Adele to re-release her album 21 with 4 exclusive tracks. Target launched a new spot for the re-release immediately following Adele's performance at the Grammy Awards, and the guest response shows that both the ad and the album have been wildly successful.", "To usher in the spring season, we are launching a campaign to show our guests that color changes everything. This campaign supports our discretionary apparel, Home and Beauty categories with a simple upbeat theme. We're supporting this campaign with bold in-store signing, along with print, broadcast and social media marketing. We launched the campaign with a 60-second spot during the Grammy Awards that continues to generate an amazing amount of buzz.", "And finally, we're very excited about The Shops At Target, which we announced last month. Beginning May 6, we will create a sense of discovery with surprising designs across a variety of departments. Flight one will include collections from 5 very different, very unique shops from around the country, offering unique products in beauty, apparel, pets, home and candy. The collection will be available for a limited time and we'll launch other flights later in the year. Beyond this new strategy, we'll continue to work with designers and brands to create Target exclusive collections. The Shops At Target is simply our latest innovation in our effort to make great design accessible at amazing prices.", "I'm quite pleased with our plans for 2012 and our sales momentum coming out of the holiday season. We're constantly listening to our guests and developing new ways to give them what they want and need. This year, we will continue to focus on providing unbeatable value, while inspiring our guests every time they shop with us, deepening their loyalty to Target.", "Now Doug and John will cover fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Doug?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide additional detail on Target's 2011's financial performance, and I'll benchmark that performance against the long-term financial plan we discussed with you in detail last August at our Financial Community Meeting. Then I'll turn it over to John Mulligan who will provide insight into our plans for 2012 and beyond.", "Our 2011 performance reinforces our belief that we remain right on track to achieve $100 billion or more in sales in North America and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017. To summarize, we expect to achieve this sales performance 5 years from now through a combination of achieving 3% average annual growth in our U.S. comparable store sales and by generating $6 billion or more in annual sales in Canada by 2017.", "And we expect to translate this sales performance to $8 or more in consolidated EPS by maintaining our current U.S. Retail EBITDA margin rate of about 10% and by deploying excess cash flow to retire 3% to 4% of our shares annually throughout that period.", "In 5 years, this recipe would result in about $7.20 in earnings per share on $94 billion-plus in U.S. sales and about $0.80 a share on $6 billion-plus in Canadian sales. This performance would also enable us to grow our dividends to $3 or more per share by the end of that period, representing a compound growth rate of about 20% per year, matching our dividend growth rate actually achieved over the last 5 years.", "As you know, we recently began reporting an adjusted EPS metric to allow all of us to measure Target's progress against our goal to grow this measure from $3.86 in 2010 to our objective of $7.20 or more by 2017. In order to remain precisely on track, you can calculate that we would be expected to generate adjusted EPS of about $4.20 in 2011, $4.60 in 2012, $5 in 2013, $5.50 in 2014 and so on. These are simply the calculated figures that define the precise and smooth path from $3.86 in 2010 to the $7.20 U.S. component of our expected 2017 performance. As such, they represent the benchmarks against which our results and our future guidance should be judged.", "So let's review our 2011 U.S. performance in this light. We generated annual comparable store sales growth of 3.0%, spot on our long-term objective, driven in part by adding 340 basis points of sales penetration on our branded, credit and debit card products. We achieved a 10.0% EBITDA margin rate in our U.S. Retail segment, again spot on our long-term objective on this critical metric.", "We had an outstanding year in our U.S. Credit Card segment, and we retired more than 5% of our shares during the year. Altogether, we earned adjusted EPS of $4.41 in 2011, well above the relevant $4.20 benchmark, with Credit Card allowance reductions driving the favorable variance. Even if we ignore the reality of this 2011 income from allowance reductions resulting [ph] from reduced risk, we still slightly exceeded the relevant adjusted EPS benchmark. In other words, in 2011, we delivered performance in the U.S., fully consistent with the performance levels required over time to meet our objectives, and we retired a greater percentage of our outstanding shares than necessary to keep up the pace.", "Importantly, we achieved all of this while laying a very strong investment foundation for a bright future for Target in Canada. Viewed from another prospective, one year ago, we outlined how we plan to grow EPS 10% or more in 2011 from the adjusted EPS of $3.86 achieved in 2010, and our 2011 results well exceeded that growth rate although with several notable variances.", "On the one hand, we fell short of achieving our earlier more robust forecast for U.S. sales growth. In our Canadian segment, EPS dilution ended up a little higher than we expected. By the way, this higher dilution was due in part to faster and more substantial share repurchase execution and a lower Canadian tax rate, both of which will create substantial shareholder value over time. In EPS terms, these factors were more than offset by the much stronger-than-expected performance of our U.S. Credit Card segment and by the larger-than-expected EPS benefit, driven by buying back more shares and buying them sooner than expected.", "I'll leave you with one final thought regarding our valuation. Many of you directly incorporate our near-term Canadian -- reported Canadian losses into a PE analysis of Target. To be clear, this makes no sense to us. Even if our future Canadian profitability were to fall short of our expectations, it's almost certain that we'll enjoy some amount of income once preopening expenses are behind us late next year. Our view is that a valuation analysis of Target today should begin with an assessment of the value of our U.S. business segments, which we estimate will earn between $4.55 and $4.75 in 2012 and which we believe are likely to grow on average 9% to 10% per year for many years to come, inclusive of the benefit of significant and growing ongoing share repurchase.", "On top of that U.S. valuation, one should add the amount you believe Canada is worth. Our view is that Canada is worth several dollars per outstanding Target share as of today and very likely much more over time. Even if you elect to severely discount our view, it's impossible for us to understand why you would elect to subtract anything instead of adding something for the substantial profits and cash flow we'll generate in Canada beginning very soon.", "With that, I'd like to introduce John Mulligan, who will provide more detail on our outlook for the first quarter, full year 2012 and beyond. John and I have worked together for many years, and I am confident he will take us to the next level. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, Doug. I'm excited to be here with you today to cover our plans for 2012 and beyond, and I'm also looking forward to meeting and getting to know all of you in the coming months. As Doug just highlighted, our 2011 performance keeps us right on track to deliver our long-run financial goals. Today, I'm going to highlight how our plans for 2012 keep us on track to meet those goals, even while we face some unique dynamics created by investments in our Canadian market launch.", "In the U.S. Retail segment in 2012, we're planning comparable store sales of 3% or a little more for the full year. This performance is expected in an environment of continued sluggish economic growth, supplemented by the impact of our remodel program, which continues to meet or exceed our traffic and sales goals, combined with growth driven by 5% Rewards.", "Based on our experience with this loyalty program in Kansas City, which has exceeded our expectations, we now expect the penetration of sales on our cards across the country will grow another 300 basis points or more in 2012, moving us beyond 12% penetration for the year.", "In 2012, we expect these traffic and sales driving strategies will drive a small gross margin rate decline for the full year. And we'll rely on teams throughout the company, but most notably our store teams, to continue this strong record of disciplined expense control, allowing us to offset gross margin rate declines along with expense pressure related to our multichannel investments.", "In total, these expectations would sustain our EBITDA margin rate at around 10% in 2012, consistent with our long-range financial plan and our actual results in 2011. This also means that expected leverage in depreciation and amortization would achieve a Retail EBIT rate of 7% or more in 2012, also consistent with our long-range plan.", "In our Credit Card segment, we expect outstanding profitability to continue. And as you saw on our fourth quarter results, we're now cycling against a period of meaningful reserve reductions, which will continue through the third quarter of this year. We expect the size of the portfolio to continue to decline, although at a slower rate as our newer, higher-quality accounts have a much lower tendency to revolve, while still driving significant incremental sales for Target. As of today, this means we expect 2012 average receivables will decline another $0.5 billion or more from 2011.", "Given these expectations, we expect to generate a spread to LIBOR in the range of 7%, reflective of a very healthy portfolio, corresponding to fewer segment profit dollars in 2012 than we experienced in 2011 for the reasons I've outlined. As we discuss this segment in 2012, spread to LIBOR will become a more important metric because pretax ROIC has become less useful analytically with the retirement of the Chase financing at the end of 2011. As you know, we funded this repayment with low-cost unsecured debt, and therefore, the interest cost associated with this new funding will not be recorded in the Credit Card segment.", "In Canada, we'll continue our work to open 125 to 135 stores in former Zellers locations, with the first wave set to open in spring 2013. In total, we believe the expense associated with these activities will drive around $0.50 of EPS dilution in 2012, at the high end of the range we laid out at our Analyst Day last August. As Doug noted earlier, if we end up with a lower-than-expected Canadian tax rate or faster-than-expected share repurchase in 2012, we might end up with slightly more than $0.50 of Canadian dilution. In fact, these 2 factors are the reason our dilution expectations have moved to the high end of the range we outlined last August.", "Of course, that's good news, because both of those events are key value creators in the long run. Among the components of 2012 expenses driven by our Canadian investments, fourth quarter 2011 Canadian D&A and interest expenses were close to the run rates you'll see in each of the 4 quarters of 2012. On the Canadian SG&A line, we expect to see quarterly increases throughout 2012. As the team there continues to grow as planned, we'll begin to incur dead rent on Zellers locations around midyear, and we buildout our Canadian distribution and IT solutions.", "Now let's turn to our expectations for our capital structure and deployment of cash in 2012. We expect about $3.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2012, reflecting approximately $2.5 billion in U.S. Retail segment, essentially flat to 2011, as we continue to make investments in our substantial ongoing remodel program, new stores, distribution, multichannel and other IT projects.", "We expect 2012 capital expenditures of approximately $800 million in Canada, down from just under $2 billion in 2011. We expect to continue our uninterrupted record of quarterly dividend payments, and we believe our board is likely to increase the annual dividend later in the year as well. Beyond these investments, we believe our debt ratings will continue to accommodate meaningful share repurchase, allowing for $1.5 billion or more in 2012. At current share prices, this would allow us to retire more than 4% of our shares in 2012.", "If a Credit Card receivable sale were to occur later in the year, we'd be able to dedicate a portion of the proceeds to share repurchase, increasing our 2012 capacity beyond this level.", "So let's put this all together. In our U.S. businesses, we expect to generate adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.75 in 2012, putting us right on the growth curve Doug highlighted earlier. Adding our expectations for Canadian dilution would result in 2012 GAAP earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. Given our outlook for 2012, we believe we'll stay firmly on track to achieve the benchmark EPS Doug laid out of about $5 or more in 2013 adjusted earnings per share. In Canada, we believe we'll experience less dilution than we did in 2012, and we'll provide a more precise estimate as our plans develop. We continue to expect that the Canadian segment to become accretive in the fourth quarter of 2013, something we first outlined for you last August.", "Finally, I'll cover our expectations for the first quarter of 2012. As we look at our business today, we feel very good about where we are headed. Our current comparable store sales forecast for the quarter is roughly 4%. And for what it's worth, our February comps have been running well ahead of that pace. But as we all know, we shouldn't get too excited about single-month trends. We expect to deliver first quarter Retail EBIT margins in line with last year's performance.", "In the Credit Card segment, we expect to generate a spread to LIBOR in the 7% range. However, we'll face our toughest comparison during the year as we annualize $125 million in reserve reductions from a year ago. Altogether, our current forecast is for Target to earn $0.97 to $1.07 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2012, with GAAP EPS reflecting about $0.09 of dilution from the Canadian expenses.", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We're very pleased with our 2011 financial results and our sales trends coming out of the holiday season. Our plans for 2012 support our long-term financial goals, while we invest in new stores both domestically and in Canada, deepen our multichannel capabilities and continue our ambitious remodel program. On top of investments in our core business, we expect to continue returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in 2012 and beyond.", "That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Kathy, Doug, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess my main question is on the quarter, how sales progressed. You mentioned, Gregg, in your prepared comments how the holiday period was promotional, you guys successfully avoided it. But it was also when your comp was weakest and the traffic was weakest. How much of that do you think was driven by online, particularly for the mid-December period where shoppers seem to just be going more and more online? And how do you expect to address that especially given your .com launches and some of the challenges you had back in September?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, .com did contribute a portion of that, but it was a combination of .com and really those first 3 weeks in December that were the softest in terms of that holiday timeframe. And as I mentioned, we were down about 1%, and in that timeframe, we were strong leading in, we were strong coming out. So we're highly confident that the core fundamentals of our business are really, really solid. And as we move into this year, we're going to continue to work really hard over the next 6 months to prepare and get our multichannel program together so that when we hit fall, we are really ready to go, and we expect then for that growth rate to exceed the company's growth rate, and it will be a positive contributor to our same-store sales increase instead of the other way around last quarter.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And just to be clear, .com hurt the comps in the quarter or did it still help, just not as much as you hoped?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, it hurt. It hurt the comp in the quarter, and the primary timeframe where it hurt the most was really in the November, first couple of weeks of December timeframe. And as we have added fixes to the website and maintained the stability and worked on things like site navigation, speed, page loading, waiting and the overall experience, we have seen our business on the .com site continue to get better. Our traffic on the site continues to be very, very good. So we're very encouraged about the fact that the guests still love coming to the website. What we were disappointing in was the experience once they got there, and so our conversion rates were not to where they had been in the past, and that aspect is what we've seen an improvement on over the last 6 or 8 weeks.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Excluding the super important 6- or 7-week period that we all focus on for the right reasons, excluding that for a moment, we've been running pretty consistent, 4%-plus same-store sales performance since the second quarter last year, while obviously our results don't exclude that period, and so we're working diligently to address that in 2012 and beyond.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. If I could, you talked about commodity inflation, how you guys managed that successfully. What do you think that aided the comp by if you were to take that average ticket growth for the year? I know at the year end, you guys usually have some sort of estimate summary.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "We'll end up reflecting in our 10-K that inflation contributed a very immaterial amount aggregate to the picture in 2011. Now obviously, that picture was quite different by category, with much higher rates of inflation in some categories, think of anything involving cotton and most anything you eat, with continued deflation in lots of other categories mixing out to a trivial net figure.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "I'd also add that the peak quarters were really, second half of second quarter, all of third quarter, first half of second quarter and then we started seeing that inflationary pressure abate as we cycled through December, and now we're back to more reasonable traditional levels.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Importantly, despite all of the fears 6, 9, 12 months ago, that whole picture had no impact that we can see or measure on gross margin rates.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "My question is on the PFresh remodels. And I'm just wondering if you take a look at the class of 2011 versus the class of 2010, I'm wondering if you could compare the performances for us?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "I would say that the performance, both of those class of stores were relatively consistent, give or take. They both met or exceeded our expectations. They were some of our larger stores in more of our denser suburban, urban trade areas. We continue to see very, very good results in year one conversion, year 2 are meeting our expectations. We're now having some stores that are just starting to cycle in year 3. As we move into year 2, we're starting to see the sales expand beyond just the Food categories into some, more of the other crossover and commodity categories. And as we move through year 2 and into 3 -- year 3, we're starting to see the increase in the discretionary categories that we had planned for over time as well. So we're on track and feel -- continue to feel really good about where we are with PFresh.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is that flow-through consistent with like the first batch of stores you did, like the, particularly the Philadelphia market?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Philadelphia was a little bit of an anomaly in that when we did Philadelphia, it was primarily about Food. We did not incorporate all of the other signature elements, the broader elements of the remodel that we incorporated in subsequent cycles. So we did far more on the visual elements in the store, carpeting, apparel fixtures, the shoe area, the beauty, home. None of those were added into or part of that Philadelphia test market. So as we go back and we will add that back over time in the Philadelphia market. So it really is not a clear indication of what the comprehensive PFresh performance was all about.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just if I missed this, how many remodels are you doing in '12?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "In '12, the number is in the neighborhood of 230.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one quick question.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "So down about 150 from last year.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And why are you decelerating the remodels?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we have a -- we started with our suburban, urban, higher volume stores. And as over time, as we completed and we fill back into those market, we just believe that this cadence is a more appropriate cadence as we go forward, as we go into our -- some of our mid and lower volume stores. And secondly, we're working on a lower cost investment on some of these. And so we're just looking at just extending out the program a little bit. And we never were really all that specific in terms how long it was going to take to complete this program. We just feel, with everything else that's going on, it's the appropriate number for 2012.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "Well, at a big picture level, for heaven sakes, we've already completed 60% of the stores.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "So 60% of our stores, excluding Super Target stores of course, that aren't relevant to this discussion. So even this year's program will convert 1/3 of the remaining stores.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick question on credit. Your bad debt provision was up almost 2x from the third quarter, just wondering why. And then, looking ahead to '12, what would you expect that allowance as a percentage of period end receivables to become a year from now?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "The expense -- I'll handle the 2011 question, I'll let John take care of the 2012. The expense was up for the precise reasons we laid out in this conference call at the beginning of the quarter. We have achieved a form of equilibrium of sorts, where our write-off rates are more or less in line with our allowance rates, and that's why you saw bad debt expense and write-offs right on top of each other during the quarter. We tried diligently to communicate this as clearly as we could at the beginning of the quarter. So behind us are the days where allowance reductions will add meaningfully to our results. For the 2012 comment, John?", "John Mulligan", "So for 2012, we expect -- we finished 2011 at about 6.5% or so allowance rate. And for 2012, we expect the year to finish pretty much right on that. So the only meaningful change in the reserve dollars will be due to the actual reserve balances coming back. But as Doug said, we feel like we've hit just about equilibrium here on net write-offs in delinquencies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Carroll with UBS.", "Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I know you talked about some sentiment issues around REDcard, how it continues to do well, penetration is there. Are there any additional, I guess, some of the numbers you can put around that in terms of the contribution to the comp? I mean, if you're still seeing kind of the sizable uptick in new card placements coming in?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "There's a little bit of a different answer, debit versus credit. And one of the curious things that you'll see in our disclosed figures is that the year-over-year growth is now, give or take, 3/4 in the debit card program and 1/4 in the credit card program that is looking at penetration increases. But by the time you blend those together, certainly, there remains a very material percentage of the sales reflected in that penetration increase that are incremental sales. Maybe that's trailing off to 1/3 given the mix, where it was once in the 40% to 50% range, but it's still a very important feature of our results.", "Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I mean, if we were to do the math on that, to try and, I guess, just look at the contribution to the full quarter comp, do you guys have that number?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We're not breaking out that specifically anymore because that is so integrated with PFresh, and it's really part of the core business sales driving tactics that we had. And because we have now gone through over 60% of our general merchandise stores, it's impossible to really break those out anymore in any meaningful way. So it's really one integrated strategy. Those are frequency driving strategies, and going forward, we're not going to be really talking about them in anything other than part of the core business driving sales programs that we have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A few questions. Gregg or I guess it's John, you mentioned that February, it sounds as if you're tracking well ahead of the 4% comp plan for the quarter. Maybe if you could give us what's driving that? Where are you seeing the strength come from, consumables versus discretionary, any color?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Yes, I can take that, Adrianne. It's really been across-the-board. We've seen, as Gregg mentioned, our discretionary businesses bounce back both in January and continuing on in February, as well as continued strength in our Grocery business, Beauty, the product areas where you've seen strength in the past. So it's really been across-the-board.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And a combination of traffic and ticket, it sounds like.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Correct.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We'll give you the full details end of next week as well, but we're really pleased with where we are at this point in time in February. But as we noted in the comments, it's one month, we don't want to get too excited or too disappointed. And we're doing a lot of things right. We have a lot of really good sales driving initiatives. We're off to a good start. We finished the year with very clean in inventory. So our stores have been reset, and they are fashion fresh forward with our color campaign. Our stores are doing an awesome job of delivering a great guest experience. We hate to use weather a little bit, but it's been milder this year compared to some of the issues we had [indiscernible].", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "It's okay to confess once in a while that weather's favorable. Seriously, we won't know for several months how much of the apparel strength in February is pulling forward sales that otherwise might have occurred in March or April versus a little gift that we should all expect every once in a while.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then my...", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "But it's across the store. It's really solid.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Terrific. And then my other question relates to the competitive environment. Gregg, you characterized the holiday as intensely promotional. It obviously took its toll on your sales. It sounds as if we could look forward to ongoing pressure, besides Wal-Mart, obviously big changes from JCPenney. We just heard from Kohl's, some pretty significant price investment planned for their opening price point. It sounds as if you're planning a small gross margin decline for 2012. I'm wondering is that largely because of the mix shift -- ongoing mix shift that you expect. But having to think about merchandise margins in a world that continues to sound as if we're going to get increasingly competitive.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, I would separate the 6 weeks out of holiday compared to the other 46-plus weeks out of the year. It is just a period in and of itself. And so everybody makes price investment and is aggressive throughout the year. We saw that throughout 2011. But it goes to such a heightened sense during the holiday, and then it typically backs down to a more normal cadence, still aggressive but still more normal. That pattern is what we have consistently seen. That's the period that we're in. All of our retail competitors make investment in price on an ongoing basis. That's really nothing new. We do the same thing. We invest billions of dollars a year in our promotional markdown and delivering great value day in and out and that's going to continue. So most of the rate decline that you were talking about going forward in 2012 is it relates to the mix issues associated with our traffic driving strategies and not any significant change in the promotional environment.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So following on that, Gregg, does it sound as if the 3% comp for the year, we should expect it to be a bit more front-end loaded and perhaps rethink of the cadence of sales for the holiday period?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it. I think that our internal expectation is, let's really get ahead, let's really try and deliver in excess of that number. And then I think that when we get in the holiday, first of all, it's the peak sales month, and it's very difficult to repeat that same kind of sales momentum consistently in the largest month of the year. And the dynamics are such that so much is around that Thanksgiving weekend, and then it goes into a lull and then there's that big finish at the end, the last 7 or 8 days, and it's just -- we just don't think it's reasonable for us to be planning our business at the same kinds of sales trend that we've experienced up and to that. So we're going to take a more modest approach during that timeframe. We're still going to try and capture as much share as we possibly can. But we're going to continue to do like we did this year and prior years, and that's making sure that we are not just driving sales at any cost, that we are appropriately trying to gain market share profitably and being disciplined in our approach to the marketplace. And if that means slightly softer comps during that timeframe, we think that's a good trade-off to make because we are not going to get into this race to the bottom and give it away at all cost and to try and capture sales, lumping significantly below cost with the whole store on sale and things like that. That's just not our strategy. We don't think it's healthy over the long term, and so we are really trying to find that right balance between driving sales and maintaining the current high level, strong levels of profitability in our EBITDA and EBIT margin rates.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then my last question relates to the management team. It sounds as if we're all looking forward to meeting John, I guess, next week. But any updates in terms of the marketing role, when we can expect that role to be filled?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "No, there's really nothing that I can really share. This is in progress, and we're being very disciplined and thorough in our approach, as you would expect us to. And as soon as I have something or we have something to share, we'll communicate that broadly to everybody.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "First question on gross margin. Just in the fourth quarter, can you help us out a little bit on -- it sounded like the underlying gross margin x the impacts from PFresh and REDcard was up. Obviously, it was a disciplined promotional stance. But can you give us any quantification of what the underlying margins did and how you were looking at the impact from the collective RED-Fresh initiatives?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "The measured impact as best we can measure them is that PFresh and 5% Rewards combined drove a gross margin rate decline a little higher, slightly higher than the aggregate reported results. And excluding those impacts, there was a slight amount of mix deterioration and a larger benefit from rate improvement within categories. But by any measure, the lion's share of our gross margin rate change on a net basis was driven by the impacts of those strategies.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then a couple of questions for Kathy. Firstly, I guess in the near term, with the improvement in sales momentum you've seen since the holidays, is there anything changing in the characterization in terms of your price points, good, better, best? It sounds like your best -- your greatest share gain was from your best customers. Are you seeing any improvement as you can tell in terms of merchandise assortment or guest improvement?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "In the discretionary side of our business, we have seen some improvement in our better and best price points. And so you'll see that in fashion with some of our more fashionable collections as well as the must-have items. You'll also see it in Home in some of our better brands, Fieldcrest, for example, Smith & Hawken, which I've talked about before, C9 and Activewear. So we are definitely starting to see some movement, and that's one of our key objectives for 2012. We've had very strong results throughout the recession in our good price point and better, but we'd like to see increasing strength in better and best, and we have started to see that movement.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then longer term, the consumer electronics category and the larger media category has obviously been a significant and persistent drag. Can you just talk about any strategies you have that you think might be able to alleviate that, and obviously, there's some structural secular issues at work there.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Yes, there is a lot going on in those industries, and in particular, some that we are very strong on given our family orientation, like video games for example. So you have seen us over the past year make some changes there with space, adding in cellphones, expanding that section, going deeper into Apple product, which performs very well with our guests, with the iPods and iPad, iPhone, et cetera. And you also saw us work through a reinvention on the entertainment side, decreasing some of the space, devoting more to children, which is our strength, and we've seen some improved results in both of those areas because of that. But clearly, as you stated, there's issues across the industry. And we need to continue to work on staying ahead of that as best we can, going after the things that are working and in entertainment working on exclusives and products that our guests -- really resonate with our guests. Like for example, you saw our exclusive with Adele, and that came out a year ago with her 21 album and we were able to re-release it with the award ceremony this year and have had terrific results. So I think we need to continue to stay on that and do more of it.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, and then finally and then I'll get off here. Just in the Home category, would you expect to comp positive in 2012 in that category?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, I don't know that we're prepared to state a number for Home, but it has been improving and I would say at least flat, if not up, here coming in the next year. We've made a lot of improvements already, and we've seen, as I said earlier, some stronger results in our Housewares business as well as our seasonal business, so we're very pleased with that and we're going to continue to capitalize on that, particularly with the strength in the kitchen side of the business with our PFresh remodels. And what we're working on now is getting the more discretionary side, domestic, .com up to better numbers. And part of that, as I talked about a minute ago, is increasing the value in our home brand which are better price points and continuing the success we see [ph] in our best price points.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.", "Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Doug, I just had a question for you on credit and then Kathy, I have a follow-up question around the fourth quarter. Doug, some of the discussions we have with some of the potential buyers of Credit Card portfolios were talking about the changes in the regs would potentially require a retail partner to have some type of liability in the future in the event a retail portfolio cards became unprofitable. And so my question is, are you hearing that and was that a stumbling block in trying to get a deal done? And if so, how you get past that? Or can you give us some idea of why you think maybe later this year, you can get a deal done? And then again, I've got a question for Kathy.", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "That really isn't driven by the regs. It's certainly a fact that some other retailers have structured deals in a way that compensates them higher in the short run in exchange for incurring a potentially meaningful amount of risk in the event that portfolios melt down. That isn't driven by the regs, it's driven by deal structures willingly entered into by others. So we could do one of those deals, we could do some other form of deal, but that's not really a factor one way or the other in getting a deal done.", "Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, so you -- that's ultimate for a potential liability wouldn't prevent you from getting a deal done. Is that the way I should take what you're saying?", "Douglas A. Scovanner", "What you should take away I'm saying is, we have the option of structuring a deal either way. And some retailers have structured deals in one fashion and some have structured it in the other fashion, obviously in exchange for incurring a downside risk. I would assume that the retailers who have that risk are getting a much larger ongoing payment stream. It's a form of insurance, if you will. But it has nothing to do with whether or not we can get a deal done. We could easily structure a deal either way if we elected to.", "Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Kathy, I was just -- as you think about December or that 6-week period there, is there an opportunity for you to move more of the new launches into that period, particularly in the early part of December so that you're not just competing on price, more about innovation and maybe more full price selling around those new launches as opposed to where they've lined up in the past?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Wayne, we're looking at that, but I would tell you a little bit more broadly, we're looking at just gifting in general and how we've gone to market, particularly in Home but somewhat in apparel. So I don't -- I can't tell you at this point what our design partnerships will look like for the back half, but we are definitely considering appropriate things that our guests would be interested in for that December timeframe where we think we can pick up some more business in the gift-giving categories.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Okay. That concludes Target's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for your participation.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 16, 2012.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our first quarter results and strategic priorities for the year. Then Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for second quarter and full year 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.", "Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of our -- to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "We're very pleased with Target's first quarter financial performance. Adjusted earnings per share, a measure reflecting the performance of our U.S. businesses, increased 11.5% from a year ago as outstanding performance in our U.S. Retail segment more than offset a year-over-year decline in credit card segment profitability. GAAP earnings per share, which includes the impact of our Canadian segment investments and unique tax items, increased 5% over first quarter 2011.", "In the U.S. Retail segment, our comparable store sales increase of 5.3% is the largest we've experienced since the third quarter of 2005 and more than 1 percentage point stronger than we expected going into the quarter. As we noted in our monthly sales releases, unusually warm weather, combined with an earlier Easter, drove stronger-than-expected traffic and sales in February and March. Once guests were in our stores, they responded quite positively to our spring merchandise assortments. Sales trends accelerated across-the-board but were particularly strong in Apparel due to the seasonal sensitivity to that -- of that category.", "We maintained a very healthy operating margin in our U.S. Retail segment as gross margin investments in our store remodel and 5% Rewards growth strategies were more than offset by underlying strength in category gross margins, combined with meaningful expense leverage. As we've indicated before, expense discipline has played a key role in Target's financial success as we've navigated the great recession and ongoing recovery. We are committed to maintaining that discipline, even when the economy and the consumer recover more fully.", "Our credit card portfolio continues to generate outstanding profitability, in addition to the value it creates by serving as the platform for our 5% Rewards program. The credit card team has done a terrific job managing this portfolio, which has emerged from the recession lean and healthier than ever.", "5% Rewards continues to exceed our expectations. Penetration of sales on our credit and debit cards continues to grow substantially, with households shopping and spending more when they add one of these cards to their wallet. And in Kansas City, which launched this program a year earlier than the rest of the country, we continue to see growth without any sign of a slowdown, even though the program is well into its third year in that market. This loyalty program drives a meaningful increase in guest engagement, regardless of the starting point. In other words, all guests, from our least engaged to our most valuable guests, become much more valuable when they decide to sign up for this program.", "I want to thank everyone on the Target team around the world, more than 365,000 strong, for driving superior performance we're reporting today. I'm inspired by your accomplishments and your passionate commitment to our guests and the Target brand.", "We continue to invest thoughtfully in our stores, adding locations when we find opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. In addition, we're transforming our existing store base to reflect our latest thinking in terms of layout, presentation and overall store experience. In the first quarter, we opened 3 new stores, adding 1 location net of closures for rebuild and relocation. We also completed more than 100 remodels, resulting in nearly 1,000 general merchandise stores that we've either opened or remodeled in the last 4 years. This means that even though we've reduced new store growth in response to the recession and resulting slowdown in commercial development, our store base is much fresher than before the recession began. Guests in these stores respond to the appealing environment by spending more at Target as we capture more of their shopping trips. While the most visible change to these stores is the addition of a broader food assortment, including an edited assortment of perishable items, guests also respond to enhanced navigation, compelling visual elements and our latest thinking in Beauty, Shoes, Home, Apparel and baby.", "As we look ahead to the remainder of 2012, we remain confident in our strategy and operational plan but cautious about the macro environment. We believe the current economic recovery will continue to be slow and uneven. As a result, we believe it's prudent to plan our business accordingly, knowing that we can quickly respond, as we did in the first quarter, when an unexpected surge in traffic and sales occurs.", "Outside of the U.S., we're pleased with our progress in preparation for the launch of Canadian Target stores in spring 2013. We are actively building our talented team in Canada, and we're on track in the development of the IT and distribution infrastructures that will service those stores. In the second quarter, Zellers will begin vacating the first set of locations that we expect to open our Target stores next year, allowing us time to completely renovate these sites to accommodate our unique merchandise assortments and operating model. As a reminder, we expect to open 125 to 135 Target stores in Canada by 2014 as a result of our real estate transaction with Zellers.", "We also continue to devote meaningful resources to our online capabilities and multichannel efforts. In the near term, we're focused on strengthening our current web platform to enhance the guest experience. Over time, our vision is to create a unique seamless integration of our stores, online mobile platforms and social media, providing our guests the same great experience regardless of the channel they choose.", "We continue to invest capital and resources in strategies that drive both our near-term and long-term performance. In merchandising, we're committed to continuous innovation, finding new ways to surprise and delight our guests. We've been pleased with the initial results from the first flight of The Shops at Target, our most recent effort to deliver great design and differentiated merchandise at prices our guests can afford.", "We're anticipating the opening of our first 3 CityTarget stores in July, with locations in LA, Chicago and Seattle. These stores will provide the Target experience to guests in dense urban neighborhoods that can't accommodate our larger formats. These stores will offer a curated assortment across all of our merchandise categories designed to serve the unique wants and needs of guests in these markets.", "In addition, we're continuing to invest in technology [indiscernible] spaces welcoming and easy-to-shop and will leverage our learnings across the chain. We plan to open another 2 CityTarget stores in October and will study results in these 5 pilot locations to inform future store growth and merchandising decisions.", "We'll continue to develop and implement strategies like our 5% Rewards, REDcard Free Shipping and Pharmacy Rewards programs that increase loyalty and drive incremental sales by offering our guests convenience and additional savings beyond our everyday low prices. We'll invest in our remodel program, bringing the total number of stores with our expanded food assortment and merchandise reinvestments to more than 1,100 across the country. This number represents about 75% of the general merchandise stores in the chain and nearly all of the eligible stores in major markets.", "And we remain committed to selling our credit card receivables portfolio. Our goal is to establish a long-term relationship with the right partner on the right terms, removing the receivable assets from our balance sheet. The right transaction will allow us to pursue our strategic objectives while sharing in the outstanding profitability we believe this portfolio will continue to generate over time.", "Many of you tell me that our vision for Target's future and the strategic initiatives to support that vision are extremely ambitious. I agree. But the experience and commitment of our talented team and our track record of success give me confidence in our continued ability to innovate, take thoughtful risks and reinvent ourselves in an environment that's changing more rapidly than ever. What remains constant is our focus on our guests and our goal to serve them better, saving them time and money in a way that deepens their relationship with Target. We believe that this disciplined focus on our guests will lead us to develop and implement winning strategies for the future, just like we benefit today from strategies we began to develop years ago.", "Finally, before I turn it over to Kathy, I want to take a moment to comment on the newest addition to our executive team, Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Jones. As you know, we conducted a lengthy and exhausted search to fill this key position, and I couldn't be happier that Jeff has joined our team. He has extensive experience and a proven record of success developing teams and building brands across traditional, digital and social media spaces. I'm confident that Jeff will build on Target's long-term success in marketing. And I'm excited to work with him to elevate our iconic brand to an even higher level.", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on first quarter results, share recent guests insights and outline initiatives for the second quarter and beyond. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg.", "Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise. Our low prices, great store experience and broad assortment in Food and Household Essentials drive traffic regardless of the economic environment. In addition, when guests feel comfortable splurging on more discretionary items, we deliver an unbeatable combination of fashion, design and value on a unique assortment of items across Apparel, Home and Hardlines.", "In the first quarter, both the pace and mix of our sales exceeded our expectations. Early warm weather and appealing spring fashions drove higher-than-expected traffic and sales, particularly in our seasonally sensitive categories. As a result, first quarter comparable store sales in Apparel grew slightly faster than the company average, the best quarterly performance in that category since 2006.", "Outside apparel, sales in frequency categories like Food, Healthcare and Beauty continue to grow consistently and rapidly as guests respond to Target's unique combination of convenience and value, especially in our remodeled stores.", "In Hardlines and Home, first quarter results were strongest in gifting and seasonal categories like lawn and patio, Housewares, Toys and Sporting Goods.", "On our website and mobile platforms, first quarter sales increased but at a slower rate than in our stores. As Gregg described, our focus in the near term is to strengthen the website experience. And while we continue to make meaningful progress, we still have more to do. Traffic to the site remains strong, and conversion and guest satisfaction scores continue to improve. We will continue to implement improvements to create the appropriate foundation for our longer-term multichannel efforts.", "Consumer research provides insight into the environment that created stronger-than-expected first quarter sales while reinforcing our cautious outlook going forward. In the first quarter, research indicated that consumers were feeling a bit more confident in their financial situations, making them somewhat more comfortable spending across all categories. However, the consumer optimism about the future reached a peak in February and began to decline in March and April. In addition, the percent of consumers planning to cut near-term spending increased in April, suggesting the possibility of shorter -- of softer growth in the near term. On the positive side, recent declines in gas prices may lead to improvements in sentiment and stronger household budgets.", "Against this backdrop of uncertainty, we're planning our inventory appropriately for the second quarter and later in the year. We're committed to achieving our sales plan and maintaining solid in-stock levels while reserving flexibility to adjust to short-term changes in traffic and sales. As we demonstrated this quarter, our base inventory can support meaningful upside to our near-term sales plan.", "For the second quarter and beyond, we've designed merchandising and marketing programs to surprise and inspire our guests and support both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise. This year, we want to show our guests that we're the one-stop shop for summer fun. We'll highlight an assortment of bright colors and fun patterns splashed across tabletop items, backyard essentials, picnic supplies and beach basics designed to make summer entertaining, fun, affordable and effortless. And we've created in-store marketing elements, visuals of oversized sunglasses or flip-flops hanging from the ceiling, that will be impossible to miss.", "For more than a decade, Target's design partnerships have played a key role in differentiating our stores and merchandise assortments, offering our guests something they can't find anywhere else and making the previously inaccessible accessible for all. The Shops at Target is the latest innovation in our partnership strategy. Rather than working with a usual [ph] designer, this program highlights items from small, distinctive specialty stores, hidden gems which up until now have only been accessible to those lucky enough to live nearby. Last week, we launched the first flight of The Shops at Target, providing guests across the country the opportunity to see what makes these shops so special, and the response has been quite favorable. With surprising finds across a variety of departments, the shops offer unique products in Beauty, Apparel, pets, Home and Candy. Our second flight of the shops will set in early September with products in men's apparel, women's apparel and Home.", "Beyond this new strategy, we continue to work with designers and brands to create Target exclusive collections. With the help of Todd Oldham, Target is letting kids be kids with our new and exclusive collection, Kid Made Modern. This collection of art supplies and activity kits gives kids and parents fun yet affordable creative design tools to inspire through art. Look for Kid Made Modern in stores and online next week.", "In music, we've partnered with Grammy winner Norah Jones to bring guests a deluxe edition of her new album, Little Broken Hearts. The Target deluxe edition, which features 3 bonus tracks, is available now. We've also partnered with 19-time Grammy award-winning music producer Emilio Estefan, who will work with Target to curate a special selection of his favorite music, movies and books, entitled Emilio Estefan's Picks. The selections will be featured online and in the entertainment department of select Target stores beginning June 6. Additionally, Estefan will leverage his strong relationships and pulse on the industry to help develop Target-exclusive partnerships with Latin music artists.", "In swimwear, we continue to build on our industry-leading market share position by growing in our owned and exclusive brands. This spring, we're very pleased with early results from the rollout of ASSETS by the makers of SPANX, featuring one-piece suits and fashion tankinis. We've also seen strong increases in young contemporary swimwear with signature print tankinis from Converse. And in Mossimo Black, we've seen -- we have created a fashion solid mix-and-match destination.", "In July, we'll roll out a new series of fits in men's apparel in both Merona and Mossimo to better match our guests' more modern tastes. We're also reorganizing the floor pad by types of apparel rather than brand to make it easier for our guests to find what they're looking for.", "Looking beyond the second quarter, we're very excited about our recently announced plans to rebrand our Target Home brand as Threshold, beginning this fall. Target Home is already our largest owned brand, but we saw an opportunity to better clarify its positioning and point of view, so we undertook the biggest rebranding effort in our history. Everything was on the table in this effort: product, quality, packaging and positioning within our brand portfolio. We engaged in a similar effort to redefine our Room Essentials brand a couple of years ago, and we've been very pleased with the results. We believe this is an opportune time to rebrand Target Home as the economy continues to improve and more guests are beginning to feel comfortable trading up from good to better brands.", "We'll debut Threshold with an assortment of entertaining essentials, accents and decorative accessories and plan to extend the brand across our entire home assortment in 2013. We'll have more information to share on this brand launch in future conference calls.", "I feel very good about the health of our business, our plans going forward and the ability of our team to execute on those plans. Across our business, we're committed to achieving the appropriate balance between managing risk and seizing opportunity, between wants and needs and ultimately Expect More. Pay Less. Instead of choosing only one or the other, we've proven successful over time by choosing both.", "Now John will share his insights on our first quarter performance and outlook going forward. John?", "John J. Mulligan", "Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide more detail on the drivers of our first quarter financial performance, and I'll wrap up by providing our current outlook for the second quarter and our 2012 fiscal year.", "As you know, last year, we began reporting adjusted earnings per share because it allows all of us to measure the performance of our U.S. businesses, excluding the impact of our Canadian segment investments and unique or onetime items. In the first quarter, adjusted EPS grew 11.5% from $0.99 in 2011 to $1.11 this year. This performance was better than we forecasted going into the quarter and just above the updated range we provided on our March sales release. Performance in both our U.S. segments was outstanding and ahead of our plan for the quarter.", "On a GAAP basis, we earned $1.04 per share, $0.07 lower than adjusted EPS, reflecting Canadian segment expenses worth $0.08 a share, offset by a $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters.", "Our first quarter comparable store sales increase of 5.3% was well above our planned increase of about 4%. These unexpectedly strong sales drove outstanding profitability when compared with both our plan and last year. As Kathy mentioned, consumer sentiment turned somewhat more positive early in the quarter, and we certainly experienced the traffic and sales impact of early warm weather combined with earlier Easter timing.", "On our sales, we earned a very healthy EBITDA margin rate of 10.3%, favorable to last year and our plan. This performance reflected a modest decline in our gross margin rate as the impact of our remodel program and 5% Rewards was partially offset by favorable sales mix unrelated to our remodel program, combined with gross margin rate improvements within categories.", "On the SG&A expense line, we gained leverage of about 0.5 percentage point, driven by continued productivity improvement in our stores and disciplined expense control across the company. As expected, depreciation and amortization expenses were essentially flat to last year, providing an additional benefit to our retail EBIT margin rate.", "As Gregg mentioned, our 5% Rewards program is exceeding our expectations in terms of penetration and incremental sales. In the first quarter, percent of sales on our credit and debit cards grew 4 full percentage points over last year to 11.6%. Notably, most of this incremental penetration is coming from our debit card, which many of our guests are choosing because they don't want another credit card in their wallet. Either choice is fine with us because, regardless of whether they choose our debit or credit card, guests on average increase their spending with us more than 50% once they get the card.", "The Kansas City market, where we implemented this program a year ahead of the rest of the country, has so far proven to be an incredibly accurate roadmap for our national rollout in every aspect. And in that market, we continue to see year-over-year penetration increases of more than 3 percentage points, giving us a high degree of confidence that this program will continue to contribute to our sales growth well into the future.", "In our U.S. Credit Card segment, we continue to earn an outstanding yield on a portfolio that is shrinking as planned. Yield for the quarter was 9.1% above LIBOR or $137 million, down from $209 million a year ago. This year-over-year decline was the result of cycling a very large reserve reduction in first quarter 2011, along with the impact of a smaller asset base.", "During the quarter, we renegotiated the private securitization conduit, which continues to fund a portion of the credit card portfolio, increasing its size by $500 million to $1.5 billion and extending its maturity until midyear 2013. We have the right to retire this financing early at par, flexibility that will be beneficial as we continue to pursue our goal of a credit card receivable sale.", "As expected, our Canadian segment recorded first quarter SG&A expense of $34 million, up from $20 million in the prior quarter, as we continue to build our Canadian team and record expenses related to IT investments. In addition, we recorded $21 million in depreciation and amortization within the segment and $20 million of interest expense on capitalized Canadian leases outside the segment, consistent with fourth quarter results.", "Even while we continue to invest in our U.S. and Canadian segments, we have the capacity within our debt ratings to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we invested about $600 million to retire approximately 10.5 million shares, fitting a very strong start on our annual plan. In addition, we paid dividends of just over $200 million, meaning we returned well over 100% of our first quarter net earnings to shareholders.", "Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year. Even though we experienced upside in the first quarter, our view of sales for the remainder of the year remains largely the same as before, given the current environment. For the second quarter, that means we're planning comparable store sales increase of around 3%. And for the year, we believe our prior guidance of 3% or a little more remains appropriate, and we're happy to have a very strong start on that plan through one quarter.", "For what it's worth, so far in May, our sales have been running essentially on-plan and consistent with our prior guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit increase. And we remain comfortable with our outlook for the quarter and the year.", "We continue to expect U.S. Retail segment EBITDA margins in line with last year's performance, with continued modest gross margin rate declines generally offset by leverage on SG&A expenses. Of course, year-over-year comparisons on these metrics in any one quarter will likely exhibit more noise than we'll experience for the year in total. As of today, we expect our Q2 EBITDA margin rate will be in line with last year's performance.", "In the U.S. Credit Card segment, we expect continued declines in the asset base, although the rate of decline will likely moderate throughout the year. We expect portfolio yield to remain quite healthy, but we'll continue to experience year-over-year declines in spread to LIBOR as we cycle large reserve reductions in last year's second and third quarters. On a rate basis, we continue to expect the portfolio to earn a spread to LIBOR of 700 basis points or more for the year.", "Our plans for the Canadian segment remain right on track, and we look forward to opening our first Canadian Target stores in a little less than a year. This year, SG&A expenses in this segment will continue to build as we continue adding to the Canadian team and we begin to incur dead rent during the 6- and 9-month period required to convert former Zellers sites into brand-new Target stores.", "So putting this all together. We expect to earn second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.04 to $1.14 and GAAP EPS of $0.94 to $1.04, with the $0.10 difference in those ranges reflecting our forecast of expenses related to our Canadian segment. For the full year, we've raised our outlook by $0.05 and expect adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.80 and GAAP EPS of $4.10 to $4.30. We continue to forecast a $0.50 difference between those ranges, reflecting our outlook for full year expenses related to our Canadian segment.", "Altogether, this performance in 2012 will keep us right on track to achieve our long-range plan for $100 billion or more in sales and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017.", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We're very pleased with our first quarter 2012 financial performance, confident in our strategy, and we're planning our business appropriately for the second quarter and beyond.", "That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Kathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "[indiscernible] rewards card, just shy of 12% penetration. It sounds like Kansas City is running 15%, and you\u2019re continuing to see pretty steady increases there. So a couple of questions. Firstly, where do you think the ultimate penetration goes? Would you expect the total company penetration to be up to the 15% range this year, given Kansas City? And is Kansas City still generating the 50%-plus lift of incremental spend, which would suggest the comp lift to the total business is running at about 150 basis points?", "John J. Mulligan", "So first on penetration. Ultimately, where do we expect penetration to go this year? I think you're probably in the right range for the company by Q4, not on average for the year, obviously, but probably in November and then obviously in December, it comes down a little bit with the sales surge. But in November, that's probably about the right range. And in Kansas City, you're right. We continue to see fantastic performance, penetration growing 300 basis points a year. And the lift there, just like it is in the rest of the country, continues to be in excess of 50% for both credit and the debit product. The only comment I'd make is -- other comment I'd make is the lift in penetration now, driven about 2:1 by debit rather than credit, and that's a reversal from what we saw about a year ago at this time.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, I would just add that over the long term we really don't know -- we're -- how high, high is. We continue to be excited about the performance in Kansas City in the chain, and we believe that there is still a long runway with the growth of this penetration over time. We're going to continue to invest in it. And clearly, guests, really, the ones that get it, love it. And our challenge is continue to get more guests to understand the immediate and powerful benefits that both of these cards provide for them.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up for Kathy. I know you do a pretty thorough job looking at pricing on a regular basis. Any comments on what you're seeing in the environment, especially in the more consumables area?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "I would say that the environment's pretty rational right now. It's always very competitive. And as we head into the summer and getting closer to Back-to-School, I'm sure that, that will heat up, as it does every year. But I would say right now it's pretty rational.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Binder with Jefferies.", "Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I had 2 questions, first on the inventory position. Obviously, you had better sales in Q1. I'm assuming maybe that's a little bit why the inventory's down slightly year-over-year. I just wanted to get your thoughts on your ability to flex in Q2. Is there any limiting factors based on your inventory position today? And then secondly, if you could share any web metrics with us that outline some of the progress you've made.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "I'll take the first one on the inventory. Our inventory remains in great shape. We have a large base inventory that we can sell into, so we don't believe there's any real -- or any meaningful limitations in our ability to perform in second quarter or even exceed the sales plan that we've laid out for you today.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "And the second one, on web metrics. We're very focused on our overall site performance, watching speed on all parts of the site, all pages, as well as our ability to improve search and order fulfillment. And so I'll tell you we've -- we're investing meaningful resources in our multichannel efforts. We're very committed to making improvements. We have seen those metrics improve meaningfully so far this spring. We still have a lot of releases yet to come this spring and summer, and we think that, that will continue to help these metrics improve. So a big focus for us, and you'll see us continue to talk about it as we go throughout the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In terms of the SG&A performance in the quarter, can you just provide a little bit more color in terms of the improvement there on the retail side?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, Deb. I think, first of all, expense has been, like Gregg mentioned, a big part of our performance over the past several years and again this quarter, led by the stores, significant productivity increases in the stores as they continue to deliver great guest experience. I think, on top of that, we saw great expense performance really across the entire company, very disciplined expense growth in all aspects of our business. And the final comment I'd make is, when we see sales surge like this, our variable expenses grow a little bit, don't ramp up as quickly as we see sales ramp up, so we get some benefit from that. You see that on the downside too when sales decelerate quickly. It takes us a little while to get our variable expenses back in line. But overall, really great expense control in the quarter.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you talk about the improvement in mix and also what you're seeing with regards to private label?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Well, certainly, our Apparel sales this spring helped our mix quite a bit, but I would say owned brands overall have been strong, really, across-the-board. Our consumables and commodity categories, as you know, continue to be very strong. All of our Apparel owned brands have been performing quite well. And in Home, we've seen good results in Room Essentials, which we've talked about before, but also Smith & Hawken and some of our better brands.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We now have 10 owned brands or signature national brands that are -- that do over $1 billion in retail. We continue to invest in our owned brands. We treat them as national brands. We position them as such. And they're a key part of our strategy. So we're -- you're going to see us continue to focus on these very important parts of our merchandising strategy, including, as Kathy mentioned, the relabeling or the rebranding of our Home brand into Threshold later this fall and as we transition into spring and summer of 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just, John, I was wondering if we could dig into the gross profit margin line a little bit more, if you could kind of put into buckets the mix impact, the impact from 5%, the rate benefits. And then I guess kind of looking ahead, what should we think about for the balance of the year?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, I think, in Q1, I would tell you that more than all of the rate declines, as we said in the comments, came from 5% Rewards and PFresh. And we saw a significant improvement in mix, as Kathy just spoke about, and a little bit of rate good news across all the categories rounded out the balance of that. I think, as we look forward, we would expect to see similar declines driven by both 5% Rewards and PFresh through Q2, Q3 and the year and perhaps a little bit of good news across the categories. We don't plan for mix improvement. That was kind of a bonus this quarter with the good apparel mix. But we'll see some rate improvement across the categories as we go forward, as well.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then after multiple quarters here of sub-1% traffic, you guys enjoyed a nice uptick here in the first quarter. Why do you think it got better for you guys? And do you think it's sustainable?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, as we said in the -- the strong early weather was certainly a portion, but overall, I would just tell you that Target's on its game. We're delivering great value, great overall experience. Our merchandising content is fantastic, it's colorful and bright season. Our stores are delivering great service. We're just doing a lot of things very well in our stores right now, and I think the benefit of that is continued market share gains across all categories and guests that really love the shopping experience at Target. And that's really what we delivered in the first quarter, and that's why I think the traffic levels were up in that 2% range.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then one last one for John. Just the credit metrics, the monthly ones that you guys report, delinquencies have come in much better here over the past few months. Can you hold our hand a little bit on how we should model the allowance line and bad debt as we cruise through the rest of the year?", "John J. Mulligan", "Sure. I think, on delinquencies, a lot of what you saw here in Q1 was really seasonal. I think that's been hard to deduce over the past several years as we kind of climbed up and then have come down. But a lot of that improvement is seasonal. Having said that, it was still a little bit better than we would've expected going into the year. I think our expectations are we'll continue to see year-over-year improvement in delinquencies as we go forward here through Q2 and then probably leveling off. Q2 last year was when we really started coming back. The delinquencies in our bad debt expense versus write-offs started to level off. So you'll see that level off getting into Q3 and Q4. I think, on the reserve, right now, we're at about 6.6% of assets, and that's about the range, 6.5%, that we'd intend to stay at for the year. I think if you look at our -- the reserve release in Q1, $35 million, 80% of that was really tied to volume of the asset base coming down, the last 20%, the last $7 million or $8 million, tied to delinquencies. So a little bit of good room in reserve if delinquencies continue, but I don't think anything significant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I have 2 questions. First on the comp. The plan you guys have, the 3%, how much of that shift from the 5.3% we just did down to 3% would you say would be traffic versus ticket? And specifically in ticket, that ASP per unit, that actually had a nice pick-up to 2.6%.", "John J. Mulligan", "Greg, that's hard to say. We don't forecast at that level of specificity, traffic versus ticket. What I would tell you -- as you know, if you step back and look at what we talked about at the beginning of the year, we said -- or 90 days ago, we said 3% or a little bit more and 4% for the quarter. Obviously, Q1 was faster than that, but given that we had a 4% in Q1, the other 3 quarters were bound to be lower, given what our thought was on the year. And that's really what you see here. So I think the 3% for our quarter is -- for Q2 is right on our thinking when we went into the year.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So maybe asked a different way, that 2.6% year-over-year, we were seeing Food or Home CPI decelerate, is it your working assumption that, that will -- that could start to take that number, the 2.6%, that, that would also slow into the second quarter? It wouldn't just be traffic, in other words, but...", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, it's possible, but that would be a relatively small impact relative to what's -- all the other variables that are driving our sales at any given time.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then second is on CapEx. Can you just update us on what the budget is for this year and sort of where that peaks as we're doing Canada and when it comes down over the next couple of years?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes. I think -- sure. This year, we're -- we remain at about $3.3 billion in total: $2.5 billion in the U.S. and $800 million in Canada. We haven't released guidance going out. But I would tell you, for the U.S., that 2.5% range could be plus or minus. Something in between $2 billion and $3 billion is the right range for us to think about in the U.S. Canada, we expect to peak next year, probably somewhere over $1 billion as we get through all the remodel cycles, just given the number of stores we're doing. And we\u2019ve said $10 million to $11 million per store, so somewhere over $1 billion next year, and then Canada easing back significantly post that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Carroll with UBS.", "Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "One quick question -- or actually, 2 -- in 2 parts going to REDcard. I was wondering, coming out of Q4, and obviously, there's a little bit more noise around the REDcard contribution during Q4 and the holidays, but I think there've been a comment where debit had been lagging a little bit in terms of the initial lift versus what you -- had been seen from credit. So that 50% blended number that you're talking about now, is there any sort of -- I guess, how big is the divergence between those? Or has it kind of normalized where the 2 have come back together during Q1?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, I think what we're seeing now -- well, first, I -- debit has started to grow significantly faster. And as that has happened, we've seen both debit and credit are within noise of each other, above 50% lifts. So both of them above 50%, and the average is right around there as well.", "Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, now that we have a little bit more data on there, I mean, how does that customer season? And I mean, if the -- is that the year one lift where you're seeing that 50% for new customers? And I mean, if so, when you start looking at year 2, I mean, do they continue to outperform the broader corporate average?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, we see that year one lift increase in total spend, and then they stay at that level of purchasing with us. They stay a very, very engaged guest. And I think that's kind of the point here, is we take a guest, and as Gregg mentioned, regardless of where they were prior to getting a REDcard, we get a sales lift on average of 50%, and they become just a much, much more engaged guest, more trips. And all of that remains in year 2. Obviously, we're just starting to get in here in year 3, but we see similar behavior there as well.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, well, that's one of the things we think is really exciting about the credit and debit products, is the fact that, whether you're a convenience user, you're least engaged, you're visiting us only seasonally or you're one of our VIPs, this card is meaningful -- these cards are meaningful for you, and you're moving up the value chain. So people that are coming very often but spending very little, they love this card. Our best guests, they love these cards -- these products too. So it's exciting that virtually all of our guest demographics understand and realize the power and the value and the benefits of our credit and debit REDcard Rewards program and visit us more often and spend more on the card. So it's really sticky, and it's got -- it's a great loyalty program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A question for Kathy. On your survey where you found that consumers kind of peaked on their confidence in February, and then we saw that drop off into March and April, what factors were they citing? Maybe give us some insights on where the consumer's head is right now.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "I think the point is just that their confidence peaked in February, but as they were looking forward, and I'm -- gas prices are a part of that and just their budget overall. They were getting a bit more cautious, which is why I said, as we look forward, we are remaining liquid and making sure that our inventories stay in line so that we can adjust, whether that confidence goes back up, like it did in the first quarter. And you can see that even on our base inventory, we can outsell our sales performance by a considerable amount. But if it doesn't and their confidence goes down, we'll be able to keep our inventories in-line and maintain our profitability. So I think it's a combination of things that are just happening in the marketplace that make them more or less nervous at any given point in time.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Have you looked back in time? Did you find that those indexes are more tied to unemployment trends? Or is it just gas prices and more near-term jitters?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "I think it's all of those things combined, but certainly, the ones that take money out of their wallet today have a meaningful impact to what they're able to spend on other products. So gas would be one of those.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And for John, on the credit card segment, first quarter was probably your toughest compare in terms of lapping the largest reserve release. Should we expect that decline in the credit card EBIT to kind of decelerate, moving forward?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, I think that's right, although we still have a very large reserve release of $85 million last year in Q2 and somewhere around $50 million -- $40 million to $50 million, in Q3, so still very large things to annualize against. But your trend is right. The year-over-year performance will improve as we go through the year.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, thank you, and we'll be watching for Canada.", "John J. Mulligan", "Great.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Sounds good. And we're excited.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is there a way to think about the weather pull-forward? It's a great debate out there amongst investors. Is it something that is isolated to an April time frame? Or do you think that some of that happens in May as well?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, nobody really knows. I think we're all sitting around, trying to figure out how much business was pulled forward, how many weeks did that go post Easter and when we're going to see a more normalized time frame. And I think we're basically there now. I think there's -- I think there were a couple of weeks maybe that bled into May a little bit. But right now, I think that it's safe to assume that the -- that any weather-related factors are essentially behind us.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then as you think about x that weather shift, do you think you had run, let's say, a 4-ish type comp x the holiday season? Do you think that shifted higher as a result of some of the improvement in macro and merchandising perhaps disruption that you're seeing in some of your competitors?", "John J. Mulligan", "Perhaps. We ran a little bit stronger than that early in the quarter. It's really hard to say. It's hard to parse those things apart. I think, like I said, when we go back to what we were thinking 90 days ago, we thought we'd run a 4. We ran a 5, so clearly, business was a bit better in Q1. But right now, we're operating about where we thought we'd be when we talked to you guys 90 days ago.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then one last question on the timing of the buyback and the flow-through. You bought back a lot of stock this quarter. Was it purchased late in the quarter, and that's why it didn't show up? And was any of it offset by share dilution?", "John J. Mulligan", "We don't talk much about the timing within the quarter, Chris. I think, anytime we're buying within a quarter, it's not going to have a lot of impact on that quarter just because of the nature of how we calculate average shares in that quarter. And I think our dilution -- any share dilution that occurred would be normal course. We didn't see anything outside what normally happens every year, every quarter as we go along.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on what Chris was asking a little bit there. The -- if I'm right, the fiscal '12 guidance was increased about $0.05 on the earnings front, and I think, versus your initial plan, you beat by more like $0.10, $0.11 if you use the midpoint. So it doesn't sound like you've got really any estimate of a pull-forward impact. But with the sales plan not really changing over the balance of the year, so just incremental conservatism given the macro outlook or just help us why not the full flow-through of the first quarter beat?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, I think, as we thought about our annual outlook, certainly we wanted to reflect the very strong performance we had in Q1. But I think, as we sat back, we also are looking here and saying, \"Well, we're through one quarter of the year. You got Q2, Q3, Q4 yet to go.\" And as Kathy talked about, our view of the macro environment really hasn't changed appreciably in the last 90 days. So while we enjoyed some weather pull-forward and had the right merchandise absolutely in Q1, and you see the benefit of that in our performance, we think that our current outlook is a reasonable outlook for our business given the very strong performance in Q1 but the fact that we've got a lot of wood left to chop here in the year before we get to the end.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That\u2019s great. That makes sense. And then just one follow-up. Your sales comparisons do start to get a bit tougher in June and July. That's when the business really started to pick up last year. The second quarter comp plan of around 3%, is that consistent across the months? Or do you assume some sort of deceleration over the June, July time frame? Or are we getting too specific there?", "John J. Mulligan", "It's pretty granular, but I think we feel pretty comfortable with all the months relatively consistently as we look across Q2.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually, 2 questions for Kathy. The first one, Kathy, just the -- I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the drivers to keep category gross margins improving, sort of how you're doing that, is it -- if it isn't mix shift that you guys are looking for to keep gross margin going up, so just some commentary on that. And then also, not to corner you, but while I have you, I think I bought 3 or 4 Kindles at your stores literally over the last 12 months, and I was hoping you could maybe give some of us some more insight into the thinking behind taking that out of your stores.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Sure. For the first question, Robbie, in terms of the gross margin, certainly, mix helped us, as I said earlier, with Apparel. And as we grow Apparel, that definitely is positive. Owned brands is another one that's positive, that we continue to grow and intend to for the future, which will help us. In terms of rates and how we're doing that, I think it's a number of things. There's not one single contributor, but it's optimizing our prices across-the-board, whether that's our regular retail, our promotional retails or our clearance. There's a lot of work that we do with that, as well as, as guests are trading up into better brands, there's typically more profit in those brands. So it's a wide mixture of things that are driving it. And certainly, our inventory control helps that as well. In terms of the Kindle, we continually go through an assessment of our assortments, and we felt that this is the appropriate decision for us to make at this time. So we will be phasing out the Kindle products throughout the spring here of 2012, and we will be out by early summer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions, one back on e-commerce. Kathy and/or Gregg, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about any sort of category dynamics that are leading you to conclusions about kind of opportunities you have where there've been deficiencies, where you're tracking below your plan or below what you'd expect, given your store penetration in those categories. And how much of the improvement going forward will come from tech investments in the service levels versus just approaching that channel differently from a merchandising standpoint?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Jeff, there's a lot of things that are leading us to decide what it is that we want to -- where we want to make improvements. Some of them are on the category dynamics and how we're selling, but even in categories where sales are fairly robust -- Apparel sales online have been fairly robust -- I still think that there's a lot of improvements that we can make. So a lot of the metrics I talked about earlier are things that affect the whole site, things like speed and search, our order fulfillment. And so we've just done, as a team, a deep assessment of how we think we're performing, where the site is slower, how good our search function is relative to some of our competitors. And that, along with the category dynamics, are driving us to where we think we need to make changes. And I would tell you that it's a combination of investment in technology but also in our process and just how we're going about our business and, certainly, to your point, our approach to multichannel versus a separate channel and how we're looking at the overall strategy by business and how that plays out online, I think, will strengthen our ability to sell product there. But a large investment will happen in technology to make us faster and smoother and easier for the guests to navigate.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups on that. In terms of the technology investment cycle, at what point do you feel like you'll be kind of through that and, from that point forward, sort of leveraging that new tech investment? And then also in terms of the merchandising staffing, will you maintain separate staffs, separate merchandising groups, going forward for those? Or will you look to more kind of integration between channels, going forward?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "I'm not -- I don't know that I can tell you about the tech investment of when we will leverage that. We are investing heavily now and see that we will into the future. It's a key part of our business, not only the product that's sold online but, of course, all of the sales in stores that are influenced by the research that's done online. So it's a key part of our business that we will invest in for a very long time. In terms of the staffing, I don't know that we've made a decision specifically on what will be separate and what will be together, but we work together on setting the strategy for each category. And then we do have separate buying teams today, although they are ever-increasingly working more closely together as the channels kind of merge and complement each other. So I think, in terms of what that looks like, that's something we will assess for a very long time, but I don't see any big changes in the short term. We are adding to that team, that's probably the biggest change, and we have been now for quite some time as it's been growing.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "I'd just add: I think, over time, we'll likely end up in some kind of a hybrid of where we are today. We've had separate and distinct teams. We have co-located and done some integrations both in terms of the strategy and the physical placements of our team. And I -- we think over time that we'll continue along those lines, although it's unlikely that everything would be integrated together. So there will be some teams that are co-located and are very, very integrated physically, strategically, and there will be other parts that will remain a little bit more separate, although, as Kathy said, we take one approach to the business, one strategy, and then it's just how we execute that across both the physical and the online space.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's very helpful. Just one other final question on Canada. In terms of the kind of market research or consumer testing you're doing in that market leading up to your opening, I mean, it seems that you have some opportunities in that market that would certainly be very distinct from the U.S. where you could index potentially very high relative to your average in potentially Apparel and other discretionary categories. Just curious about that process, how you're preparing for those potential differences.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, you're right. We do believe that's a whitespace opportunity for us. And we've done a lot of research, a lot of different kinds of research, and there's no one aspect that leads to any one conclusion. We continue to listen and learn and get close to the Canadian consumer. Many of them are very familiar with the brand, either shop in our stores or they are current REDcard product holders, so there's a high familiarity of the Target brand. And they're looking for the Target experience. They really want the full-blown Target brand experience as we come to get Canada. So that, first and foremost, is our -- our priority is to deliver a great Target experience across all categories, great service, great team engagement. And then because there is -- what we believe is some whitespace in Apparel and Home, we're going to go after those businesses, and we'll look to over-index and over -- or invest a little bit more heavily in the space and some of the physical assets so that we can take advantage of what we believe is going to be a great opportunity for us to deliver our Expect More. Pay Less. strategy in those categories. So we would agree with you on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Two quick questions. I guess one of them is a follow-up on the question about Canada. If you could look back to when you decided initially to go into Canada compared to today, what changes do you see in the competitive environment over that period? And does that at all change your outlook? That's question number one. And then second, can you just give us an update on the cross-shopping of multiple areas within the store for guests who've signed up for the 5% Rewards card? Are the -- is the basket for that customer -- you mentioned it increased. Does it represent all areas of the store? Or is it concentrated in any particular area of the store?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Looking back on Canada at this point in time, we don't see anything that we would do differently. I mean, the -- it's really the Canadian consumer that's going to benefit by our entry. We're -- we hope to become their favorite store as we enter into that. But clearly, all of the Canadian competitors are anticipating our arrival, as well as the Canadian consumers, and so they are improving their value proposition, they're investing in their asset base, they're improving their experience. And ultimately, that is just going to better serve the Canadian market. We hope to launch very successfully and wow them with our content, value proposition, speed of service and all the wonderful things that we do, Target here in the U.S. We look to do that in Canada as well. And ultimately, the Canadians are going to have a far-superior shopping experience across all channels due to our entry. But there really isn't anything that we look back in hindsight and say, \"Hey, we would do anything different,\" at this point in time.", "John J. Mulligan", "Right. And on the 5% Rewards basket question. We see a basket in the incremental lift that is very, very similar to the baskets of that guest prior to their experience. There's a very, very small mix impacting gross margin, but it is insignificant relative to our gross margin or the performance of the 5% Rewards program.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Thank you.

Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Target Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, November 15, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Supply Chain; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and highlight some of our enterprise strategic priorities, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "We're very pleased with Target's third quarter financial performance, which we announced earlier this morning. Our U.S. operations generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, above the midpoint of our guidance and 4.3% above last year's very strong performance.", "Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share increased 17.6% to $0.96, as dilution related to our Canadian segment investments was more than offset by favorable tax items and a gain on the pending sale of our receivables portfolio.", "Our U.S. Retail segment generated third quarter comparable-store sales growth of 2.9%, in line with our guidance going into the quarter. And this segment generated an EBIT margin rate a bit ahead of expectations, matching our very strong profit performance in the third quarter of 2011. This profit performance reflects the continued benefit of thoughtful and disciplined expense management throughout the organization.", "For the last 2 years, we have relied on this discipline to offset gross margin rate investments we've made in our 2 most visible growth strategies: 5% REDcard Rewards and our PFresh remodel program.  I want to thank our team for reliably delivering on this expectation quarter after quarter, successfully controlling expense growth while continuing to provide an outstanding experience for our guests.", "We also remain focused on improving our online shopping experience, which has resulted in robust growth in online sales and meaningful increases in guest satisfaction scores. In addition, as we further increase the functionality and ease-of-use of our award-winning mobile apps, we continue to generate rapid growth in the mobile channel.", "We've rolled out free in-store WiFi across the chain, allowing guests to research products and use our apps while they're shopping in our stores. And we'll continue to integrate digital features into our fourth quarter marketing, incorporating QR codes in our store signing and marketing vehicles. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest meaningful resources to ensure our stores, online and mobile platforms provide a seamless experience that allow our guests to engage with us, wherever and whenever they choose.", "We continue to be pleased with initial results from our newest format in the United States, CityTarget. After 2 additional third quarter openings, we now have 5 CityTarget stores operating in 4 different metropolitan areas: Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. As expected, initial traffic to these stores have been strong, while gross margin mix has been slightly better than expected. The CityTarget team has done an outstanding job, accomplishing a virtually flawless launch of this new format. We plan to open 3 more CityTarget locations in 2013.", "Our U.S. Credit Card segment delivered another outstanding quarter, with risks at historically low levels and profitability near historic highs. In addition, following extensive efforts, we were very excited about this quarter's announcement of our agreement to sell our Credit Card portfolio to TD Bank Group, accomplishing all of our goals for a sale, including moving the assets off our balance sheet, maintaining the deep integration between our Retail and Credit Card operations, continuing to earn the majority of profits generated by this high-quality portfolio and importantly, finding the right partner who will be aligned with our goals for portfolio growth and profitability. We're pleased to be working with the outstanding management team at TD Bank, and we look forward to closing this transaction in the first half of 2013.", "In our Canadian segment, we're moving forward in our efforts to open our first stores by next April. We now have 45 stores under renovation, and we have 1 distribution center operating and another one scheduled to come online soon. And we are on track with implementation and testing for our Canadian segment technology platform.", "Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of talent we are hiring for our Canadian team, both at headquarters and for our stores organization who will serve as the primary ambassadors for the Target brand. While there are many significant milestones to come, we feel very good about our ability to open our first Canadian stores on time, on budget and on brand.", "As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we feel very good about our ability to deliver inspiring merchandise, most wanted gifts and unbeatable value, while also generating expected profitability. Our stores are ramping up their preparations to deliver a Target brand experience on Thanksgiving weekend, delivering must-have items at incredible prices for an event which promises to be bigger than ever. Following that weekend, we will launch a series of merchandising and marketing plans designed to sustain excitement all the way to Christmas, with our groundbreaking partnership with Neiman Marcus at the top of the list. Kathy will provide more detail in a few minutes, but with more than 2 billion media impressions already, this event is clearly creating a lot of excitement.", "While programs like Neiman Marcus event continue to elevate the Expect More side of our brand promise, we know that it's crucial for Target to continue to combine differentiation with unbeatable value. That's why we're very pleased to announce our new online price match and extended Holiday Price Match at our media event last month. These programs are yet another way we work to assure our guests that they can feel good about shopping at Target. The fact that we can offer these programs convey our confidence in Target's prices, which are consistently low every day and even lower when we run a promotion. These programs, along with our ongoing price match guarantee and 5% Rewards, allow our guests to shop at Target, a store they love, with the confidence that they're getting the very best deal.", "And importantly, price matching is fully integrated into our overall profit plan for the fourth quarter. As you know, every year, we invest aggressively in price to provide value during the holiday season. Our price matching programs complement our holiday promotional plan, and we believe they are a smart way to invest in price to deliver compelling value for our guests.", "While we continually look for ways to broaden our reach and appeal to a wider set of guests, we believe our first and best opportunity lies in deepening our relationship with our core guests, earning additional trips and spending from them. A prime example is 5% REDcard Rewards, which motivates our current guests to shop at Target much more often, generating an average sales increase of more than 50% in households that begin using a REDcard.", "This program turns less-engaged guests into some of our best guests, and makes our best guests even more valuable. We're on pace to add over 3 million credit and debit accounts this year, creating a powerful platform to provide additional loyalty features. For example, last month, we announced that in addition to saving 5% on every purchase in stores and at target.com and earning free shipping on all target.com purchases, REDcard holders will now receive an extra 30 days to return their purchases, if needed.", "Guest response to 5% Rewards continue to exceed our expectations, as penetration of sales on our cards rose to a record 14% in the third quarter. This is nearly 3x the 5.5% penetration we experienced 2 years ago in the third quarter of 2010 when we launched the program nationwide.", "Similarly, our PFresh remodel program, which launched in 2009, was a result of research with core guests who told us they would shop at Target more often if we provided them a more compelling food assortment, including perishables. The addition of a deeper food assortment gave us the opportunity to completely reinvent our general merchandise format,  transforming categories throughout the store in a visually compelling environment. Today, we operate 1,130 stores that have either been remodeled or newly built with this layout. And our guests continue to tell us they love what we've done to their Target store.", "Together, 5% Rewards and our remodel program are making Target more relevant to our guests than ever, creating an outstanding platform for future innovations in our merchandising and loyalty programs.", "As I look across our business today, I'm very pleased with our performance throughout the enterprise. Our team is doing an outstanding job of balancing strategic innovation with day-to-day excellence in execution.", "The team is aligned and motivated in support of our strategic roadmap and delivery of our long-range financial plan. And as John will cover in more detail, we're anticipating 2012 adjusted EPS that will keep us on track in the delivery of that long-range financial plan.", "Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to personally thank the thousands of Target team members in the Northeast who have worked tirelessly to help their local communities recover from Superstorm Sandy. Our thoughts and prayers are with those whose lives were affected by this terrible storm.", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on our third quarter results, recent guest insights and provide more detail on initiatives for the fourth quarter and beyond. Kathy?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. We are pleased with both the pace and mix of our third quarter sales. As expected, comps were strongest in less discretionary categories, with particular strength in Food and Health & Beauty.", "In more discretionary categories, comparable-store sales in Home led the way, most notably in seasonal categories and Housewares. Comps in Apparel were up slightly, with the strongest results in Men's Apparel and Performance Activewear.", "In Hardlines, comps were down slightly overall, with the strongest performance in Sporting Goods and the softest performance in Electronics, which continued to reflect mature product cycles in several key categories.", "Strengthen in Back-to-School and Back-to-College categories was a key driver of our third quarter sales results. This year's comprehensive marketing campaigns drove guest awareness, and our in-store navigation and signing streamlined and simplified shopping trips for our guests.", "As Gregg mentioned, we're very excited about initial results in our new CityTarget stores. Traffic has been very strong, and guest feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Initial research indicates that the typical guest in this new urban format is younger and more affluent than we see on average across the chain. And as expected, these stores are attracting many new guests.", "We continue to make significant investments in our online and mobile platforms, both to improve the performance of our existing site and mobile applications, and to test and inform future opportunities. Throughout the year, our teams have been focused on ensuring site stability and enhancing our search and navigation capabilities.", "More recently, we've improved our speed of checkout, order flow and fulfillment. As a result, our online guest survey scores are much higher than a year ago, and our mobile apps continue to receive industry accolades. And importantly, we believe we are well prepared for the upcoming launch of the Target Neiman Marcus holiday collection and the peak traffic levels of the holiday season. While we feel good about the progress we've made, continuing to improve the guest experience remains a top priority for 2013.", "In addition to the specific investments we're making in online and mobile channels, we're also investing in ways to further integrate the shopping experience across channels. For instance, we recently installed new scanners at point of sale in all of our stores to make mobile coupon redemption smoother and faster than ever.", "We are expanding our use of shoppable media, incorporating QR codes and text-to-buy features. And in October, we launched an online debit and credit card application on target.com and saw an immediate meaningful increase in overall REDcard applications.", "Our research with guests indicates they are continuing to shop with discipline, focusing on lists and budgets and occasionally splurging on more discretionary items. Notably in the third quarter, we saw an increase in trips, focused only on need-based items. This guest feedback corresponds to overall consumer sentiment data, showing that while consumers have increased confidence about their near-term prospects and personal finances, they have a high level of uncertainty about the longer-term health of the economy and intend to continue saving and paying down debt. For the holiday season, consumers anticipate spending slightly more than last year, but indicate they'll be focused on value, pricing and promotions.", "This data informs our outlook for the fourth quarter and next year. We continue to position our inventory appropriately, maintaining the flexibility to chase sales when we experience unexpected demand, while simultaneously managing markdown risk.", "Beyond this focus on order quantity for each season, we continually work to find opportunities to reduce our inventory investment by optimizing our supply chain. In fact, while you'll note that our total inventory at the end of the third quarter was lower than last year, more than 100% of that decline was due to a reduction in inventory outside our stores. Levels of inventory located within our stores, where it's available to be purchased by our guests, were up slightly from a year ago at the end of the quarter.", "Looking ahead, we are confident in our holiday merchandising and marketing plans. As always, we expect the season to be highly competitive and promotional, and we have the compelling assortments and exceptional value to make Target the top shopping destination for our guests.", "In Toys, we're focused on ensuring our guests know that Target has the best values, especially on must-have items. In store, we've created QR codes for each of our top 20 Toys, which allow guests to purchase items by scanning the codes on store shelves and having them shipped anywhere in the U.S. for free.", "Our annual toy catalog features more than 200 toys, specially priced, to give guests the best value on the toys kids really want. Guests can browse the catalogue online and create a Target digital wish list that is instantly shareable via email. And the target.com/toptoys page is the ultimate online destination for toy lovers of all ages. This site contains links to more than 10,000 toys, including more than 300 exclusives from Barbie, Fisher-Price, LEGO and Target-owned brands such as the Circo and Play Wonder.", "In Music, our exclusive partnerships ensure we've got something for everyone, with albums in-store now from P!nk, No Doubt, Rod Stewart and Taylor Swift. In fact, our exclusive Taylor Swift album, RED, became our top-selling CD release of all-time. And we're keeping the momentum in Music going with our partnership with the hot U.K. pop group, One Direction, which we announced last month. That album, which just set earlier this week, is already off to a very strong start.", "We're also investing heavily in our Latin music business, allocating more in-store space in key markets and partnering with legends like Emilio Estefan to curate our collection. Our Target exclusive version of Tony Bennett's new Duets album, which set a few weeks ago, features the hottest artists in Latin music.", "This year, our merchandising and product design and development teams have created a multi-layered gifting strategy in categories across the store. In Apparel, we've rolled out gifting trees, showcasing colorful product with lots of shimmer and shine. In Home, we've expanded our boxed gift program with amazing prices on unique items in beautiful boxes that are easy to wrap and give. And we've transformed our See. Spot. Save. area in the front of the store to a stocking stuffer destination.", "And of course, at the top of our gifting strategy, we're thrilled about our unprecedented partnership with Neiman Marcus and 24 of the most influential and sought-after designers in the country. This unique collection of 50 great gifts, that are certain to wow our guests, will set in stores December 1. Like any limited time offer, we expect these items to sell quickly, particularly given the amazing media attention that we've already received, as Gregg mentioned earlier.", "Beyond this gifting strategy, we're very pleased with results from our 2 newest brands in Home. The Nate Berkus collection, sold exclusively at Target, has already been a hit with guests since setting late last month. This signature Home collection features bedding, bath, accessories, lighting, rugs and window treatments. This will be an ongoing collection with new items added to the assortment in 2013.", "And we're pleased with the launch of our new owned-brand collection, Threshold, which offers guests a fully redesigned, high-quality collection that will inspire and help update their homes. The collection debuted this quarter with a small assortment of entertaining essentials, accents and decorative accessories, and will continue to roll out through spring 2013.", "We are pleased with our third quarter performance and believe we are well positioned to give our guests a superior shopping experience and drive profitable growth in what will certainly be a highly promotional fourth quarter. And as we look beyond this quarter in the holiday season, we believe our merchandising and marketing strategies will continue to engage our guests, strengthen their love of the brand and deliver strong financial results for Target.", "Now John will share his insights on our third quarter performance and outlook going forward. John?", "John J. Mulligan", "Thanks, Kathy. Even though we were cycling over our strongest quarterly performance in 2011, this year's third quarter results reflected strong profitable growth.", "Retail sales were in line with our guidance, and profitability was near the high end of our expectations, with a superb execution across each of our business segments. Specifically, we generated third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.90, compared with an expected range of $0.83 to $0.93 going into the quarter. Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.96, reflecting $0.13 of dilution related to our Canadian segment, offset by a $0.15 gain due to the pending sale of our Credit Card portfolio, along with $0.04 of good news from a resolution of income tax matters.", "In our U.S. Retail segment, comparable store sales increased 2.9%, consistent with our guidance for the quarter. This comp was slightly slower than our second quarter performance, but on a 2-year basis, our third quarter comp accelerated slightly. Similar to last quarter, comparable store sales were primarily driven by an increase in average ticket, combined with a traffic increase of 0.5%. Penetration of sales on our credit and debit cards was 14% in the third quarter, up more than 400 basis points from a year ago. As Gregg mentioned, this program shows no signs of slowing down and continues to drive meaningful incremental traffic and sales.", "Profitability in the U.S. Retail segment was somewhat better than expected. Our third quarter EBIT margin rate was flat to last year, and our EBITDA margin rate was down only slightly, even as we compared against very strong prior-year performance. Recall that for the year, our plan was to generally maintain our full year EBITDA and EBIT margins flat to last year. And our results for the first 9 months show that we're right on track to meet that expectation.", "Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, third quarter gross margin rate was down a couple of tenths from a year ago, as gross margin investments in 5% Rewards and higher frequency category mix from our PFresh remodel program, were partially offset by rate improvements within categories.", "Our merchandising team has done a great job managing margins within their individual businesses, a key factor in delivering profitability in our U.S. Retail segment.", "Third quarter SG&A rate was flat to a year ago, reflecting continued expense discipline across the organization, combined with the impact of higher expenses related to technology and multi-channel investments.", "Our U.S. Credit Card segment had another great quarter, earning more than 9 percentage points above LIBOR. Profit dollars were down slightly due to a 4.7% decline in average receivables and a more modest reserve release compared with third quarter 2011. Importantly, delinquencies and write-off rates continue to decline from what are already historically low levels.", "In our Canadian segment, we continue to invest in technology, supply chain, store renovations and the team as we prepare to open stores in spring of next year. These activities led to $72 million of SG&A expense in the third quarter which, when combined with D&A expense and interest expense associated with the segment, reduced our third quarter GAAP EPS by $0.13.", "Even as we engage in significant investments to launch our Canadian segment, our operations are generating excess cash that we continue to return to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid dividends of $236 million and invested just over $100 million in share repurchase. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we invested about $1.9 billion in dividends and share repurchase, an amount representing more than 90% of our net income.", "Our priorities for deployment of capital remain unchanged. We invest in our core businesses on projects that fit our strategic and financial criteria. We support the dividend, and we engage in share repurchase with the goal of maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings.", "In the third quarter, we announced our agreement to sell our Credit Card portfolio to TD Bank for the gross value of the receivables at time of closing. We plan to deploy the proceeds from this sale in a manner that's neutral to our debt ratings. Given the amount of leverage we've applied to these assets, we expect that following closing, we will invest 10% or a little more of the proceeds, in our current share repurchase program, and the remainder in debt production over time. We continue to expect to close this transaction with TD in the first half of 2013.", "Now let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We're expecting fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase in the 2% to 3% range. Sales in this range would lead to a full year comp of 3% or more, consistent with our long-range plan and our expectations going into the year.", "As you know, we have a 53rd accounting week this year. Because we measure our comparable-store sales over periods of equal length, our fourth quarter comp will not reflect sales in the extra week. As a result, the gap between Target's fourth quarter total and comparable-store sales will be much larger than normal. We expect fourth quarter REDcard penetration will increase 400 basis points or more above last year, consistent with our recent experience.", "In Kansas City, where we launched REDcard Rewards a year earlier than the rest of the country, penetration reached 20% this month, in advance of an expected temporary decline due to normal seasonal pattern. This milestone is notable because 20% penetration represented a stretch goal when we launched REDcard Rewards. And given that so far, our nationwide experience has followed Kansas City 1 year later, we expect to mirror this performance across the chain in fourth quarter 2013.", "In the U.S. Retail segment, we expect our fourth quarter EBIT margin will be essentially flat to last year, driven by a moderate decline in our gross margin rate, offset by leverage on the SG&A and D&A expense lines.", "In the Credit Card segment, we expect to earn a spread to LIBOR of 8% or more, generating spread to LIBOR dollars in line with our third quarter performance. However, given that we've already cycled the large reserve releases in 2011, this performance will represent an increase in year-over-year dollar profitability for the first time this year.", "Combining all these expectations, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS representing results from our U.S. operations, of $1.64 to $1.74. This performance would put us at the high end of the full year guidance we provided last quarter and would put us ahead of our long-range plan's 2012 benchmark on our journey to achieving EPS of $7.20 or more in the U.S. by 2017.", "In Canada, we anticipate that expenses will grow beyond our third quarter experience as we begin to hire a large group of team members to open our first stores in the spring. Canadian D&A will also increase as we continue to invest in technology and supply chain to serve these stores.", "Our current expectation is that activities related to our Canadian market launch will reduce our fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.19. Combined with our expectation for adjusted EPS, this dilution would lead to fourth quarter GAAP EPS $1.45 to $1.55. While the economic environment this year has not been as robust as many of us would've hoped, our business has performed beyond our expectations.", "Specifically, 9 months ago in our year end 2011 conference call, I laid out an expectation for full year 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.55 to $4.75. Given 3 quarters of actual results, combined with the fourth quarter outlook I just outlined, we now expect full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. This means the low end of our current range would put us at the high end of our expectations going into the year.", "Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "As Kathy, John and I have all indicated this morning, we're very pleased with our team's performance and the financial results we delivered in the third quarter.", "While we recognize that the fourth quarter and the holiday season are always intensely competitive, we are excited about the plans we have in place, confident in our team's ability to execute and optimistic about our ability to capture our fair share of our guests' hearts and wallets.", "Now Kathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Starting on the top line, could you just talk about the impact of either inflation or deflation and what you're seeing in terms of either Food or Apparel at this point in the game?", "John J. Mulligan", "Deb, this is John. I don't think we're seeing really any material impact from the top line due to inflation in any of our categories -- specific categories across the store. And certainly, as we would aggregate that across the store, as has been the case for the past several years, in aggregate, inflation impact is immaterial to our results.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then as we're looking at SG&A, should we expect tech investments that are expensed to stay at the same run rate that was experienced in the third quarter?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, I think that's pretty reasonable. We continue to invest meaningfully in technology across the enterprise. And as we've said, we're also investing now in multi-channel initiatives across the enterprise and specifically around dotcom. But like I just said in the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the fourth quarter despite those investments ongoing.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then as your online performance continues to improve, how do you think about the halo effect from the stores and leverage that? And then any thoughts on buying online and shipping to the store?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "You know, Deb, we do think that there is a halo effect when our site is performing well. As you know, guests do a lot of research online, but then they want to come into stores and purchase. And of course, there's a lot of people who come into the store, see the product and perhaps want a different color that we offer online. So after looking at the product, decide to still order through target.com because they want something that we offer that's different online. So we see sales going back and forth between the 2 all the time, which does make those channels blur quite a bit. But I think the health of our site certainly impacts the health of our stores. And I'm sorry, what was your -- the second part of your...", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Buy online, ship to store.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "Buy online, ship to store. At this point, we are not offering that service to our guests. But it is something that we've been talking about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just wanted to focus on the REDcard a little bit. It looks like the penetration, the year-on-year increase in penetration, was actually accelerating a little bit and with Kansas City at 20%, it certainly suggests there's a lot of upside potential. What do you think is driving that? I've noticed that there's certainly a bigger push behind marketing the program. And is there any difference in the recent, let's say, 400- to 500-basis-point penetration of the newer cardholders or what you're seeing in Kansas City? Any difference in their behavior in terms of incremental spend, in terms of the FICO score, in terms of anything relative to the first, let's say, 10% to 12% penetration?", "John J. Mulligan", "Well, we'll try to answer all 6 of those questions in order. I think you hit it right on the head, we are seeing the performance of the REDcards continue to accelerate, and we've seen that both in Kansas City and in the U.S., and our penetration continue to increase. I think the big driver, and we've talked about this a couple of times this year, continues to be the debit card. The debit card continues to grow roughly at about 3 accounts for every one account of credit, and that has been kind of the secret sauce in the significant growth. As far as performance of the card, we continue to see both either a debit or a credit card, once they're opened, more than a 50% increase in sales on average at a household level. So the performance remains very similar to what we've seen for the past couple of years, both in Kansas City and in the broader -- in our entire store base. And I'm trying to think what else, what else you asked, Colin?", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I think that was it. But if 20% was the stretch goal, what's the stretch stretch goal now?", "John J. Mulligan", "Hard to say. I think 20%, I think we said about -- if you'd have asked us a year ago, we would've said we thought 20% was the top. Obviously, with Kansas City hitting that for a period of time, and as we said, that will come back here in the fourth quarter just due to the dynamics of the quarter, we'd expect the company to be there next year, and we think there's just a very long runway here. We think the product is an outstanding offer. Clearly, our guests are starting to understand it. The store teams are doing a great job as they communicate with our guests, helping them understand both the credit and the debit offering. So you wrap that all together, and we think there's a long runway here.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, we haven't -- we see no reason to establish an upside benchmark at this point. And I would just add from -- in addition to what John said, our guests really love this because Target is their favorite store or a favorite store of theirs to shop to begin with. And this is a very powerful, immediate and simple program. I mean, they -- we have a lot of our guests that spend thousands of dollars, and that 5% savings, along with the other bets [ph], is a meaningful savings to them. And you don't have to accumulate points or anything. And the debit card in particular has been very, very successful. So those shoppers who are coming to Target on a very regular basis can save a lot of money throughout the course of the year. So it's very understandable why they like this program so much.", "Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then second question for Kathy. Neiman Marcus, what's your expectation for cross shopping that customer who comes in for the relatively limited 50 items? And can you tell us at all what the dollar value of the inventory was in Neiman Marcus products?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "We do think that there will be a lot of cross shopping, Colin, as we've seen with other limited-time partnerships that we've had, but we think particularly this time of the year, the guest is coming in to buy gifts, maybe some self gifting, but also gifts for people on their list. And Target is a great place to get gifts of all type. And so we think they'll come in for Neiman Marcus, but we do think that they will shop the rest of the store, and there will be some impact. In terms of the inventory and the dollar amount, we don't disclose what we buy or sell on these limited partnerships. But we are very excited about it.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "And it will be our biggest event, our biggest partnership event that we've ever conducted at a great time of year as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "On the new Holiday Price Match, what's your expectation for the portion of transactions that might have this price match? Is this low single digits? And then given that price transparency is here to stay, might you consider doing this as a full-time measure?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Yes, this is Gregg. We don't see a lot of price match activity in our stores. We've been price matching for a long time. Our value proposition is so good day in and day out, and our circular price offering is so good that we don't expect this to be meaningful. So it will be in the -- we expect in the single digits. And we'll take a look and evaluate this post-holiday to determine what our plan is going forward. We haven't made any decisions as it relates to that at this point in time and really want to get through the have the period and regroup and assess the campaigns to determine how to address 2013.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then I may have missed it, but can you give us a sense for how you're tracking in November? And what is the comp range expected for fourth quarter?", "John J. Mulligan", "As you might expect, the beginning of the month was a little bit choppy, certainly with Sandy on the East Coast, the election, a few things going on. But we feel really good about the guidance we gave for November of a low and more important than that, we feel really good about the quarter, the 2% to 3% comp that we just talked about for the quarter.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "So much of the -- I mean, we have 2 weeks down, 11 weeks in front of us, and we have so much of the business concentrated in that Thanksgiving weekend and in the 10 days before holidays, so that the vast majority of the holiday season is in front of us at this particular point in time. So we're excited about it. We've got a great plan. Our stores are ready, our teams are ready. We've got a great value offering and some really inspiring merchandise. So we believe we'll profitably take market share this holiday season.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On the Credit Card, you mentioned you're going to retain a majority of the profits. What are we going to see there in terms of reporting moving forward and just a little perspective there?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, we did say the majority of the profits. I think as we indicated, when we made the announcement, ultimately, we will report, as everyone else does once they no longer own the assets, we'll report the net impact, the income less the expenses that we incur for servicing those assets in SG&A within our Retail segment. So that's our plan going forward.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just for Canada, as we start to look forward there, when do you expect to give us an outlook on the dilution we could expect for 2013? And then what's the arc there? As you start with the sales, are you expecting kind of weak margins to start? And how do we think about the progression once it gets going?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, we'll -- we're working on detailed plans for both Canada and the U.S. business both, and we'll walk you guys through our exact plans financially when we do the fourth quarter conference call. I think importantly for Canada, probably the most important thing is that the Q4 of next year is when we have said we'll move from dilution to accretion. So our focus is on getting profitable in Q4 2013, and we feel good about that right now. I think when the stores open up, there's a lot of variables there. We said for a long time, we have a better idea of where the stores will be in year 2 or year 3 than we do in year 1. Lots of volatility, we'll certainly see a surge early, and then we'll settle in and we'll refine as we go along, both our merchandising assortment and how we operate those stores. So I think we would expect to see sales and margins we will -- we do expect to see both sales and margins improve as we go along. But by that, I don't mean you should be looking quarter-over-quarter. This will take us a couple of years to refine our operating model in Canada.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the Neiman question. Gregg, you mentioned that it's the biggest event ever. Am I correct that it's bigger than Missoni was last September? I thought you had about 150 products, so that sounds like you're expecting to have more inventory of a smaller assortment here?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, it will be substantially larger than Missoni, but this is more tightly edited in terms of the number of items that we have. So the commitment behind each item will be substantially more than any event that we've ever done. And given the time of year that it is and the fact that these will make great holiday gifts, the inventory on a per-item basis is something that we've never supported in the past. Missoni and some of other ones have had hundreds of SKUs, as you know, and this has a much more narrowly-defined assortment base.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Perfect. So you're not selling out in day 1.5 this time?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we're hopeful that this is our biggest success yet, but we're not making any predictions as it relates to the sell-through timetable. Like any event of this magnitude, there are going to be some items that sell through very, very quickly and other items that will take a little bit longer to sell through. But overall, we look at the entire assortment, we look at the portfolio of designers, and we think across the board, there's something for everyone. So we think it's going to be successful across the board. It's just a matter of how you want to gauge success, is it hours, or days, or possibly a week, which might be a stretch.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Perfect. Then one follow-up. On the grocery side, grocery comps moderated in October. And so I was just wondering if you could help us with how much of that was moderation of price inflation versus cycling the hump of the PFresh opens last year? And what do you think is sort of a sustainable comp is in that category, assuming inflation doesn't really go anywhere from here?", "John J. Mulligan", "I think as we look at October, we think very little to do really with inflation in that category. We think the majority of what we saw in October was cycling over what was, by far, our largest PFresh remodel program in one cycle last year. As we think about grocery going forward, mid to high comps seem reasonable for us for a run rate as we look ahead here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "John, a question on leverage and then on online for Gregg or Kathy. On leverage, ex credit, it seems like you should be a little under 2x debt-to-EBITDA versus 2.5x now. Is that where -- well is my math is right; and two, is that where you want to run the business long term, or should we assume it goes up a little bit above 2x again?", "John J. Mulligan", "Your math is pretty correct, Greg, and I think that's about the range that you'll see us operate in. As we've said, we want to maintain the current credit ratings that we're at, and we believe as we talk to the agencies, and we'll go back and talk to them again, obviously, once all the dust settles from the receivables transactions, but we believe that's about the right range where we'll continue to operate.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then -- that's helpful. And second on online, I mean, last year, that was an area where you were down, and I know that was a disappointment. I'm just curious in this year's fourth quarter guidance, what do you expect from online sales growth? And linked to that, how much is REDcard penetration in terms of online sales? I imagine it's quite higher than the 14%.", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, first, as it relates to the impact on the comp, as we said last year, when it was not helpful, it wasn't material. And this year, while we do believe it will be helpful to the comp, it won't be a material portion of it. And I think you're exactly right, the REDcard penetration online is higher than we see in the stores. And as you might expect, in certain categories, it is significantly higher than we see in the stores, given the 5% off plus the free shipping online, you don't have to let your mind wander too far to think about categories where the penetration is probably pretty significant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions. John, first of all, just on the tax rate. We've consistently seen some benefits here for the last several quarters. So I'm just curious, as you think about the fourth quarter, maybe some parameters around how you think the tax rate is going to come in? And then secondly, on inventory, you mentioned that there was less outside the stores. Is that something -- is that a structural change that we should be thinking about, or something that was just a bit more unique to this period?", "John J. Mulligan", "Sure. On the tax rate, I'll take that, and then let Kathy talk about inventory. We have seen several, what we have characterized as onetime events over the past several years, and they have been truly onetime as we have settled many discrete tax matters. I think for fourth quarter, we'd expect to see rates similar to what we saw last year. The caveat I'll put on that is that with Canada, with our dilution growing meaningfully year-over-year, the rate in Canada is much lower than we see in the U.S. and that, of course, puts -- when we have losses, puts pressure on our consolidated tax rates, so some impact related to that, but nothing material.", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "And on the inventory side, the team has done really an incredible job of managing our inventory, both to be in stock but at the same time optimizing the supply chain to make sure that we're keeping that as tight as we possibly can. A lot of the improvement that we're seeing is just indicative of what's happening right now in our business. So first of all, better management of our receipts in Toys and Home. There's some timing shifts in some gift-giving categories like Electronics. But then as we talked about in the last call as well, longer term, we continue to really succeed in moving a portion of our base inventory out of our distribution centers and our store backrooms and getting it onto the sales floor, which is a huge win for us because that's where guests can shop it. So we continue to work on those initiatives.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Not to be too near-term focused, but did I hear you, Gregg, earlier that even with the Sandy impact and the choppiness that you saw, you still feel good about November comps up low single digits?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Well, we feel that for the quarter, we're going to be within the range that we have described and how we have characterized November. So much of November comes around the Thanksgiving weekend, and that's ahead of us yet. So we still feel good where our plans are for the month and for the quarter.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then beginning of the year, I believe you guys stated the intention to do about $1.5 billion in buyback -- $1.5 billion in buyback. You didn't really do much here in the third quarter. So I was wondering as why, and I guess if you still feel good about that $1.5 billion target for the year?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, I think we actually said $1.5 billion or more. And I think the key is, and you see this in the third quarter in other areas, is we don't do that just on autopilot. I think as we saw, the stock price went up pretty aggressively in third quarter. We always pause to see where the market's really going to land and make sure that we're buying at a reasonable pace for the year. We still think $1.5 billion or more is a reasonable range for us to end in.", "Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then -- and last my question, just to circle up on the Canada topic. A couple of years back, Doug talked about the dilution before you started to make money in that segment, to be about $1. It looks like this year, with last year, will be about $0.62 of dilution. So should we think about the first 3 quarters of next year being about $0.38 of dilution to make up that $1, or is there something different that's changed?", "John J. Mulligan", "Well, as we -- as I said a little bit earlier, we haven't provided any guidance on 2013 yet. I think if you look back, you'd find that Doug used the words \"For example\" when he talked about that. But I think more important than that, as I said, we'll be back in about 3 months to give you our detailed view of what we think will happen in Canada over the next 4 months. And you kind of hit on it there subtlety, but again, I go back to, I think, Q4 is the key date for next year when we move from dilution to accretion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Maybe Kathy, just a question on the merchandise. In terms of Apparel, you mentioned Men's and Performance as relatively strong in the quarter. And given the comp that you produced in that category, implies maybe a little bit weaker trends in Women's and Kids. Was it more in the fashion, basics or seasonal and anything you can help to do to reinvigorate the growth in those 2 areas for the fourth quarter?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "You're correct, our strongest performance were in Men's and our Performance Activewear, which is -- Activewear has been strong really all year, both because it's a great trend in Apparel right now, but also given the quality and the value that we offer in C9, it's been really an exceptional performer. I think the weakness in Kids and ready-to-wear, or relative weakness, I think is mostly driven by seasonal. We saw some really good strength in sort of our better must-have product. But we are still waiting for weather to break in most of the country, and we have a lot of seasonal apparel, both in Kids and in ready-to-wear in particular, which is still off to a slower start. But I do feel great about the holiday season. Our sweaters are starting to sell and some of the other seasonal product that we have in ready-to-wear. So I think our assortment looks good. It's -- we'll see here in the next few weeks.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then I guess, secondly, a question for John. You had mentioned that the SG&A was up a little bit from higher expenses in technology and multi-channel, but should leverage that in Q4. I guess, is this primarily associated with sales from that extra week that you're getting that leverage, or -- and should we expect a higher comp leverage point potentially on SG&A on the U.S. business for the foreseeable future as you make these investments in technology?", "John J. Mulligan", "Yes, it would start on Q3. I think the other thing I would remark upon relative to Q3, is last year in Q3, we leveraged 40 basis points of SG&A. So when we talked about the quarter at the beginning, at the end in our second quarter conference call, we actually expected to delever a bit more than we did. So we're pretty pleased with our expense discipline across the company in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, certainly, a small element of that is related to the 53rd week. But frankly, most of the expense leverage that comes in the 53rd week is across depreciation and amortization because of the way we expense that. And that's where most of the benefit comes as you might expect. Most of our expenses happen in the 53rd week just like anyone -- any other week. Benefits, payroll, which is obviously our biggest expense across the enterprise, property taxes, that all happens just like normal. So that's the primary benefit. Going forward, we've said that we expect to maintain our EBITDA margin rates. And so we expect to overcome gross margin rate compression with SG&A leverage and to do so at a 3 comp. So nothing's really changed in our formula. We expect to accommodate the investments we're making in multi-channel and technology, both within our capital plan and our SG&A plan going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.", "Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "On the -- just wanted to follow up on the Apparel question. If we look at what you've been doing with your different partnerships, they're very interesting, they create buzz. I'm curious, in order to get the comp maybe moving up a little bit in Apparel, is there any hope of doing something a little bit more permanent with any of these partnerships? And do you think that your price and value proposition is right?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "We feel that having limited time partnerships with designers is the best place for us to be because it allows us to capitalize on current trends in the marketplace and designers who are up and coming, and we've had a great response to that. And throughout the course of the year, our Apparel business has been really solid. So I do think that our price-value relationship is very good. This is an awkward time of the year given how much seasonal product that we have in Apparel and waiting for that weather to break and guests to get really interested in seasonal product, is always sort of a timing issue. But when you look throughout the course of the whole year, our Apparel business has been very solid, and I think it will continue to be solid.", "Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And if I could follow up, last year, I believe on the third quarter call, you had commented about your competitor's layaway program maybe having an impact on you. I'm curious, they started it earlier this year, they actually quantified it today about how much they thought it was extra. We didn't really hear much from you on that. Do you think it had any impact on your business?", "Kathryn A. Tesija", "I don't think our guests, based on our research, is that interested in layaway. They are interested in great prices every day. So I think our value equation is really important to them, couple that with our Holiday Price Match, which gives them confidence to buy any time during the holiday season and know that if it appears at a lower price from Target or anyone else later in the season, that they can get that price matched, as well as we've talked about with our debit and credit card, getting 5% off, I think that's really critical to our guests, much more so than layaway.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two quick questions. First, just a follow-up on price match. Although there's not a high usage rate for that, do your focus -- does your focus group research show that having it in place improves loyalty or conversion in the store? And when it is used, is there any disruption to checkout?", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "We don't conduct the price match policy at the checkout. We conduct it at the service desk. And our whole strategy is about delivering a great experience and having our guests have confidence in our pricing, our value proposition, day in and day out is rock solid. On ad, we meet or beat the competition, 5% REDcard reward on top of, or in conjunction with our Price Match Guarantee, is a winning combination and unbeatable in the marketplace. So it's very strong, it's very compelling, and we're just -- we're excited about it because the value proposition is so good.", "Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then lastly, I realize there's some runway ahead of us here. But how are you thinking about the 5.3% compare in Q1 early next year? Are there any specific plans in place to comp that in addition to the ongoing benefit of 5%, PFresh and other initiatives?", "John J. Mulligan", "Well, I think as we said, we haven't provided any specific guidance. But I guess, I would point to Q3 this quarter. We cycled against very strong results this quarter, a 4.3 comp, profit rates, EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were very strong for the quarter, and we just produced another very strong quarter. Obviously, last spring and first quarter, and we talked about in the conference call, it was the perfect storm of good things all happened. We had the right merchandise in our stores, weather was great and people felt great about shopping. So we have some strong business to cycle. But we'll be back to talk about what we intend to produce for results in Q1 in about 3 months.", "Gregg W. Steinhafel", "Okay. Well that concludes Target's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for your participation.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Baird ", "Bob Drbul - Barclays", "Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Target Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, president and chief executive officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, executive vice president of merchandising; and John Mulligan, executive vice president and chief financial officer.", "This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and strategic priorities as we enter 2013. Then Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights, and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our outlook for 2013. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a Q&A session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "We\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which reflects outstanding execution by our team during a volatile and promotional holiday season. Our U.S. operations generated fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.65, 10.1% above last year and in line with our prior guidance, even though sales fell short of our expectations. Our fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share were $1.47, reflecting Canadian segment dilution that was slightly favorable to our expectations. ", "As we previously reported, fourth quarter comparable store sales in our U.S. retail segment grew 0.4% compared with an expected increase of 2-3%. In addition, our holiday season sales became even more concentrated around Black Friday and in the days leading up to and just after the Christmas holiday.", "This presented challenges for both our merchandising and stores teams, who did an excellent job maintaining profitability, adjusting receipts to mitigate markdown exposure, and maintaining outstanding guest service while delivering productivity improvements. ", "We are very pleased with fourth quarter sales in our digital channels, as online and mobile sales grew faster than industry averages. As a result of our efforts to improve the website throughout 2012, key performance metrics are meaningfully improved, and our mobile sales and traffic are growing at a triple-digit pace off a much smaller base.", "As we\u2019ve described in the past, our investments in the website and mobile technology drive guest engagement with Target, and lead them to shop more across all of our channels. For example, following the launch of free wireless in all of our stores in the fourth quarter, Target.com was, by far, the site most commonly accessed by guests while they were shopping in our stores. As Kathy and John will describe in more detail, our plans for 2013 reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in a robust multichannel experience for our guests.", "Our U.S. credit card segment maintained its long string of outsourcing quarterly results, as the portfolio is producing healthy profits in conjunction with very favorable risk metrics. We are working to complete sale of our portfolio to TD Bank Group and expect the transaction to close in this quarter. John will provide more details in a few minutes.", "When we step back and view the year just ended, we are proud of the ambitious, strategic agenda and financial results we delivered. Beyond our multichannel initiatives and significant work in Canada to prepare for this year\u2019s openings, we were very pleased with the initial performance of our first five CityTarget stores, where we\u2019re seeing robust sales and traffic as well as favorable payroll expense and gross margin mix.", "And, we\u2019re thrilled that our efforts on this unique urban format were recognized earlier this month when Fast Company magazine ranked Target among its top 10 most innovative companies. As we continue to hone the operational model for CityTarget, we will apply what we learn across all of our formats in the U.S. and Canada. ", "In our Canadian segment, preparations for our market launch are reaching their peak. We expect to open our first 24 Canadian stores by early April, and after more than two years of effort, our Target Canada team is eager to welcome their first guests and begin generating sales. ", "The former Zeller sites are being completely transformed into brand new Target stores that look terrific and feature our latest thinking in terms of layout, fixtures, and design. For the year, we expect to open 124 Canadian Target stores in five waves before the Christmas holiday season. This ambitious launch has required the team to be both nimble and disciplined, setting an outstanding example for the entire organization.", "In addition to our Canadian store openings, we\u2019re planning to open 15 to 20 new stores in the U.S. this year, including three additional CityTargets. Net of closings and relocations, we expect these openings will add 10-15 new locations to the chain. Combining these expected U.S. store openings with our Canadian expansion plans, we expect to open many more new stores this year than any other year in our history. ", "Also, in keeping with our commitment to invest in our existing stores, we plan to remodel just over 100 of our stores in 2013. This is a more moderate pace than in each of the past three years, as the majority of our stores now reflect our newly reinvented general merchandise format. ", "This layout is much more appealing to our guests and incorporates a deeper food assortment, merchandise reinventions across the store, and a more visually compelling shopping environment.", "As we enter 2013, we will plan appropriately as the U.S. economy is growing at a painfully slow rate and unemployment remains persistently high. While there are some encouraging signs in the housing market, volatility in consumer confidence, the payroll tax increase, and rise in the price of gas all present incremental headwinds.", "Given these new challenges facing an already sluggish economy, we have a tempered view of the near term sales environment. However, as we have seen in the past, our guests are quite resilient. We will be vigilant in monitoring our business and our teams will be ready to capitalize on unexpected strength as they demonstrated in the first quarter last year.", "We believe that we are well-positioned to succeed, even in this uncertain environment. We\u2019ll focus on providing unbeatable value and back up that commitment with our newly enhanced price match policy, which now covers offers from key online competitors year round.", "We\u2019re also committed to taking smart risks on bold, innovative ideas and learning quickly from the results. We\u2019ll raise the bar in differentiation, providing our guests unique products and experiences at affordable prices. And, as Kathy will outline in more detail, we will continue to partner with designers on unique collections that embody the \u201cExpect More\u201d side of our brand promise and remind guests why Target is special.", "In addition to investments in our stores, website, and award-winning mobile apps, Target Red Cards provide a key platform for our loyalty initiatives. We are seeing continued strong growth in the penetration of sales on these cards, as Red Card guests respond to the opportunity to save 5% on practically every purchase, receive free shipping every time they shop on Target.com, and benefit from an extended return policy.", "As I reflect on 2012, I\u2019m incredibly proud of what the Target team has accomplished. As John will outline in a few minutes, we performed very well against all of our financial goals for the year, keeping us on track to attain our long range financial objectives despite a challenging environment.", "Beyond these financial goals, a year ago we had an ambitious list of priorities for 2012, including improving the performance of Target.com following our platform relaunch in 2011; an unprecedented effort required in Canada to finish three distribution centers, begin renovating stores, build an IT solution, and hire thousands of Canadian team members; launching a completely new urban format with our first five CityTargets; finding the right partner to purchase our credit card receivables assets on appropriate financial terms; and transitioning two key positions on our executive management team. ", "While this was a bold agenda, our team embraced it and emerged from the year with more energy than ever. As I mentioned, we made meaningful progress on the website, CityTarget is an operational and financial success, Canada is on track, and we\u2019re on the verge of closing the sale of our credit card receivables. And importantly, we\u2019ve added two outstanding members to our executive management team in Jeff Jones and John Mulligan.", "The challenges facing us in the year ahead are more short term in nature, and I am confident in the clarity of our strategy, the power of our brand, and the strength and commitment of our talented team to achieve our goals and deliver another year of outstanding results in 2013. In other words, we are quite optimistic about our ability to successfully compete in a dynamic retail environment while generating meaningful shareholder value over time.", "Now, Kathy will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results, and outline initiatives for the first quarter and beyond. Kathy? ", "Kathryn Tesija ", "Thanks, Gregg. Though we fell short of our overall sales goal for the fourth quarter, we were pleased that we grew comparable store sales in four of our five merchandising categories and that we sustained our profitability in the face of choppy consumer spending and an intensely competitive environment.", "Consistent with the rest of the year, fourth quarter comparable store sales were strongest in our less-discretionary frequency businesses, which saw growth in the low to mid-single digits. In both of our discretionary home and apparel categories, fourth quarter comparable store sales increased in line with the company average and saw rapid growth in our digital channels.  ", "Fourth quarter comparable store sales in hard lines declined in the mid single digit range and were softest in electronics. Many more electronics categories are in mature stages of the product cycle, and during the holiday season electronics constitutes the primary battleground where competitors engage in their most irrational promotions.", "In toys, overall fourth quarter comparable store sales were down slightly overall, but increased about 30% through our digital channels. When we look back at our 2012 results, we\u2019re pleased that we also grew full year comparable store sales in both home and apparel, while research indicated that our guests were focused on reducing discretionary spending overall.", "We achieved this outcome by gaining meaningful wallet share from our best guests and our loyalty initiatives played a key role through three separate programs in 2012. First, our PFresh remodel program is designed to drive more trips among our core guests by offering them more convenience and the ability to do more of their shopping in a store layout they love.", "Second, our 5% Red Card rewards program led our guests, regardless of their previous level of engagement, to increase their shopping frequency and spending dramatically. Our research shows that on average Red Card guests shop almost 2x more per month than guests without a Red Card, and these guests shop 2.5 more departments per visit compared with non-Red Card guests.", "Finally, our newest loyalty program, Pharmacy Rewards, saw phenomenal success in 2012. Pharmacy guests are already among our best guests, shopping about 3x more often than our non-pharmacy guests. However, Pharmacy Rewards guests are even more valuable, shopping on average more than 50% more often than our already valuable pharmacy guests. ", "Notably, these programs complement one another, driving even stronger guest loyalty and incremental sales. For instance, guests participating in both 5% rewards and Pharmacy Rewards shopped more often and spend more across the store than guests who participate in only one of these programs. Throughout 2013 and beyond, we will explore ways to extend these programs and find new ways to drive guest engagement, traffic, and sales. ", "As Gregg mentioned, fourth quarter sales grew, and our digital channels were quite strong, having accelerated throughout the year as we improved the site\u2019s stability and speed while enhancing search and navigation. These investments are clearly driving higher overall guest satisfaction and with our continued focus on expanded content and site functionality, we expect continued improvement in 2013.", "We\u2019re also seeing amazing growth in traffic and sales through our mobile platforms. Mobile purchases now constitute more than 7% of our digital sales, and mobile traffic is now more than 25% of our overall digital traffic.", "Guests are responding to the significant enhancements we made to our mobile offering in 2012, including improved design and navigation, becoming one of the first retailers to participate in Apple\u2019s Passbook and growing out a way-finding pilot in select stores.", "As mobile continues to grow in importance, we will focus on creating in-store guest experiences and testing new technologies that make smartphones an even more useful shopping companion with enhanced product search, maps, and shopping lists.", "We\u2019re also exploring ways to integrate relevant product offers and promotions with the in-store mobile shopping experience. And, of course, as a member of MCX, the Merchant Customer Exchange, we\u2019re involved in a collaborative effort among a broad group of top U.S. merchants to develop a mobile payment system that is widely accepted, secure, and easy and convenient for our guests to use.", "In 2013, we\u2019re planning to increase our investment in technology and supply chain to enhance our multichannel capabilities. We will apply a test-and-learn approach to discover what our guests value most while assessing the impact on our operations. Our goal is to leverage existing assets to enable more flexibility fulfillment of our guests\u2019 shopping needs in a way that makes sense, both operationally and financially.", "In 2012, through small pilots in the Twin Cities and San Francisco, we plan to test the ability for guests to pay online and pick up in store, the ability for guests to pay in one store and pick up at another store, and the ability to pay online and have items shipped from a store, including the option for same-day delivery.", "We believe these tests will provide valuable information as we continue to shape our multichannel strategies. Ultimately, we expect to evolve towards more integration across our inventory and supply chain in which our stores, regional distribution centers, and web fulfillment centers all interact seamlessly to satisfy guests\u2019 wants and needs through all our channels.", "After improving gradually in 2012, consumer sentiment fell sharply in the fourth quarter, reflecting turmoil surrounding the fiscal cliff and overall political uncertainty. In addition, more than 50% of U.S. consumers believe that the economy will either remain the same or get worse in 2013, and 85% indicate they expect the economy to impact their lifestyle for the next several years. ", "Beyond these potential headwinds to consumer spending, the average U.S. household will see a $1,000 reduction in their after-tax income as a result of the recent increase in payroll tax rates. However, even in this challenging environment, we expect to win by strengthening guest loyalty and driving increased sales through merchandising that supports both sides of our \u201cExpect More, Pay Less\u201d brand promise.", "We\u2019ll continue to match prices on identical items offered by both store-based and online competitors. And, we\u2019ll offer guests affordable products and experiences that allow them to treat themselves and their families while staying within their budgets.", "For example, in apparel, we are very pleased with the response to our current designer partnership, Prabal Gurung for Target. Prabal is one of the most celebrated designers in the fashion industry, and this collection embodies his signature style and design aesthetic, all at affordable prices. The Prabal Gurung for Target collection features ready-to-wear, handbags, shoes, and jewelry that provide key differentiation for Target this spring. ", "We\u2019re also very pleased with the response to our partnership with Sports Illustrated and their swimsuit issue. As you know, spring swimwear is already a signature business for Target. Through this collaboration, Sports Illustrated is creating its first style guide, which will feature original content from the publication\u2019s esteemed editorial team, specifically geared towards their female readers. This partnership reinforces Target as a swimwear destination by allowing us to reach a unique audience with our on-trend, affordable offerings.", "Also this spring, Target is collaborating with Kate Young, one of the most influential stylists in the fashion industry, to introduce a limited edition collection of women\u2019s apparel, accessories, and shoes. We\u2019ve worked with Kate as a stylist for years, but for this project, she took on the role of designer, translating her unique aesthetic and ability to create memorable, red carpet moments into a standout collection for women. The Kate Young for Target collection will be available beginning April 14 at all Target stores and Target.com.  ", "In home, we continue to build on the success of the Nate Berkus collection, which launched last fall. This collection includes more than 150 home products, with prices ranging from $6 to $150, featuring stylish and relatable pieces that feel like they were collected over time and designed to be easily layered into existing d\u00e9cor. We\u2019ll be adding new items to this ongoing collection in 2013.", "And throughout the spring, we\u2019ll continue to roll out our threshold brand to replace Target Home. Initial results from this brand launch have been favorable, as guests respond to this fully redesigned high-quality collection that\u2019s inspiring guests to update their homes. ", "In entertainment, we\u2019re following up our very successful fourth quarter partnership with Bruno Mars and One Direction with an exclusive version of Josh Groban\u2019s new album, \u201cAll That Echoes,\u201d which launched February 5. ", "And, we were very excited to announce our latest partnership with Justin Timberlake during the Grammy Awards earlier this month. Target will offer an exclusive version of Justin\u2019s latest release, \u201cThe 20/20 Experience,\u201d featuring two exclusive tracks available at Target and Target.com, beginning March 19. ", "In electronics, we continue to focus on service as a value-added differentiator for our guests. In the fourth quarter, we announced that we would be ending our current relationship with Radio Shack in our mobile phone business, and would begin working with Brightstar to provide supply chain and point of sale activation and market source as our new in-store labor partner.", "This change demonstrates our continued commitment to mobile as a key element of our electronics offering, and we believe it will enhance Target\u2019s position in the wireless retail marketplace. This transition will occur in early April.", "Also, as you know, last October we launched a test with Geek Squad to provide in-store service agents in 20 Denver Target stores. Based on positive feedback from our guests, Target expanded this test by offering Geek Squad service and replacement plans in 20 stores in Kansas City beginning February 17. Future partnership plans will be determined following the results of these tests.", "And finally, our beauty category continues to experience very strong and consistent growth on an assortment that generates better than average profitability while serving as a key differentiator for Target. As you know, last year we began testing a store service program in which dedicated consultants offer friendly guidance and expertise for guests shopping our beauty area. Based on 2012 results in 28 Chicago-area test stores, we are looking to expand this program to additional markets in 2013 and beyond.", "While we remain cautious about the economy and its impact on consumer spending, we are confident in our brand, our strategy, and our merchandising and marketing plans. We believe we offer an unbeatable balance of value and excitement on both wants and needs that continues to drive guest loyalty and engagement with Target.", "Now, John will share his insights on the fourth quarter and full year performance, and outlook for 2013. John?", "John Mulligan  ", "Thanks, Kathy. As Gregg mentioned, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our business, particularly in the face of an intense holiday season promotional environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.65 is 10.1% above last year, and reflects solid performance in our U.S. retail segment, combined with continued outstanding performance in our U.S. credit card segment. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $1.47, $0.02 last year, as growth and adjusted EPS was offset by Canadian segment dilution. ", "Before I provide more detail on our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2013, I want to pause briefly to recap our full year 2012 performance. One year ago, in my first quarterly call with all of you, I explained our plans, which would keep us on track to attain our long-range financial plan of generating $8 or more in EPS on $100 billion or more in sales in 2017. ", "That 2012 plan was based on the following expectations across our three segs: U.S. comp store sales growth of 3% or more, continuation of our very healthy U.S. retail EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 10% and 7%, a moderate decline in our gross margin rate offset by leverage in SG&A and D&A, an increased Red Card penetration of 300 basis points or more throughout the year, a decline in the size of our credit card portfolio of $500 million or more with a portfolio spread to LIBOR of 7% or better, and about $0.50 of EPS dilution related to our Canadian market launch.", "I also outlined that in 2012 we expected to invest a total of about $3.3 billion between the U.S. and Canada, continue our uninterrupted record of paying quarterly dividends, increase the annual dividend during the year, and invest $1.5 billion or more to repurchase our shares. Altogether, these expectations combine to an expected range of $4.55 to $4.75 in 2012 adjusted EPS and an expected GAAP EPS range of $4.05 to $4.25, reflecting expected Canadian dilution. ", "Today, when you compare our actual 2012 performance against all of these metrics, you\u2019ll see we met or exceeded all of them, except for U.S. same-store sales, which we missed by 3/10 of a point.", "Altogether, we earned full year 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.76, above the range going into the year. GAAP EPS ended up well above its expected range, reflecting adjusted EPS performance, lower than expected dilution in Canada, and the gain we recognized on our credit card receivables held for sale.", "This gain reflected the attainment of another one of my goals, to reach an agreement to sell the receivables portfolio to the right partner, on appropriate terms. I want to thank the entire Target team for their contributions to the achievements of our strategic and financial goals in 2012, a remarkable accomplishment, particularly in light of the environment we faced.", "In the call a year ago, both Gregg and I outlined that our expectations for U.S. retail segment sales were stronger in the first three quarters of 2012 and more modest in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s clear that we got the cadence right, but the contrast between the first three quarters and the holiday season was even more pronounced than we expected. ", "With that as context, let\u2019s turn to the specifics of our fourth quarter segment results. In the U.S. retail segment, fourth quarter comparable store sales increased 0.4%, driven by a 1.4% increase in average ticket, which offset a 1% decline in comparable store transactions. ", "As we mentioned several times throughout 2012, our fourth quarter retail strategy was focused on providing relevant offers to core guests, profitably growing sales and market share from guests who want to shop with us all year long. We believe this strategy was effective, because despite softer than expected sales, our teams managed the business effectively and retail profitability held up remarkably well.", "Our fourth quarter gross margin rate went about 60 basis points below last year, reflecting the ongoing impact of 5% Rewards and our remodel program, combined with clearance markdowns on seasonal inventory. ", "In the fourth quarter, our team managed SG&A expense incredibly well, leading to a small amount of rate leverage. This is something we generally wouldn\u2019t expect on a 0.4% comp, particularly when our sales plan for the quarter was higher. ", "This performance is even more noteworthy, because we were able to offset incremental expenses related to technology investments in multichannel and other initiatives. This pressure was offset by continued expense discipline across the organization and once again, our stores team was able to generate meaningful productivity improvements while providing great guest service. ", "We also experienced fourth quarter leverage on the depreciation and amortization expense line, reflecting the moderate pace of U.S. capital investment in recent years, combined with the benefit from the 53rd week of sales in this fiscal year. ", "In our U.S. credit card segment, performance in the fourth quarter was outstanding once again. Portfolio spread to LIBOR was $3 million higher than last year, a 27% increase, even though average receivables were more than 4% lower than a year ago.", "Portfolio profitability continues to benefit from historically low delinquency and writeoff rates that continue to improve. I want to thank our financial services team. The quality of our receivables portfolio reflects their dedication and effort in managing through a recession and credit crisis worse than many of us thought possible.", "The superior performance and profitability of this asset enabled us to reach a sale and servicing agreement with TD Bank, a premier financial institution that shares our goals for portfolio growth and profitability. ", "In our Canadian segment, we\u2019re pleased with the plans we have in place, and we\u2019re on track to open our first 24 stores this quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded expenses related to investments in technology, supply chain, store renovations, and the team, as we continue to ramp up our efforts to open more stores in Canada in 2013 than any single year of U.S. store openings in our history.", "These activities drove $118 million of SG&A expense in the fourth quarter, which, along with D&A and interest expense associated with the segment reduced our fourth quarter GAAP EPS by $0.18.", "Even as we prepared for peak Canada capital investment in 2013, our business continues to generate ample cash to allow us to fund investments in our business, support the dividend, and engage in share repurchase. In the fourth quarter, we invested about $645 million to retire more than 10.4 million shares. This means that, combined with the dividend, we returned nearly $900 million to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, representing more than 90% of net earnings.", "Now let\u2019s turn our attention to our plans for 2013. This year will clearly be a year of transition, which will result in some unique dynamics in our P&L. First, when we close the receivables sale with TD Bank Group, we will recognize nonrecurring accounting items related to the sale and discontinued reporting of U.S. credit card segment. ", "At the same time, in the U.S. retail segment, we will begin recognizing income from profit sharing, net of accounts servicing costs, as an offset to SG&A expense. On an annualized basis, we expect this change will reduce our U.S. retail segment, SG&A rate, by about 30 basis points, leading to an equivalent increase in our U.S. retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates. Of course, the impact of full year 2013 will be less than this annualized impact. The fiscal year has already begun, and we have not yet closed the transaction. ", "One housekeeping note, my guidance today will compare against last year\u2019s financial results, which included separate retail and credit card segments. Once we have closed the receivables sale, we will report performance of a single U.S. segment and compare against restated prior year results which combine our results from the former U.S. credit card segment and U.S. retail segment. ", "To provide clarity on these restated comparisons, after the sale closes, we plan to furnish three years of quarterly restated U.S. segment results. While we don\u2019t have a definite closing date, we\u2019re confident it will occur before the end of the first quarter. ", "Second, in the Canadian segment, we expect to transition from recording meaningful quarterly dilution in the year to recognizing accretion by the fourth quarter. And finally, I need to briefly discuss a geography change on the U.S. retail segment P&L that will influence gross margin and SG&A expense rates in 2013.", "Beginning this year, we have made changes to our vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of our marketing programs. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2013, these payments will be accounted for as a reduction in our cost of sales, rather than a reduction into SG&A expense. This change will create equivalent year over year increases in both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates of 20-25 basis points, without affecting our U.S. retail EBITDA and EBIT margin rates.", "So as you can see, we have a lot of changes that will create some noise in our numbers throughout the year. With that context, let\u2019s begin with a look at our 2013 expectations for our U.S. retail segment. ", "As Gregg mentioned, we are ending the year with a cautious view, and might have heightened economic uncertainty, in which challenged consumers are now facing additional pressures including rapidly rising gas prices and a payroll tax increase. We\u2019re planning full year 2013 comparable store sales to grow in line with our 2012 rate of 2.7%. This growth will be combined with a moderate benefit from new square footage and offset by the comparison against this year\u2019s 53rd week, meaning total sales are expected to grow about 2%.", "We expect a slightly higher U.S. retail gross margin rate, reflecting the vendor payment geography shift I mentioned above, combined with category rate improvements which should offset ongoing pressure from 5% Rewards and our remodel program. We also expect to see a slight improvement in our U.S. retail SG&A expense rate for the full year. ", "This expectation reflects continued discipline throughout the organization, along with the benefit from credit card profit sharing, which will offset the geography shift in vendor payments and continued pressure from investments in technology and supply chain, including multichannel. Those investments are expected to be worth $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS in 2013. ", "Altogether, we expect a 2013 U.S. retail segment EBITDA margin rate in the range of 10.3% and an expansion of the U.S. retail segment EBIT margin rate to around 7.5%, reflecting very healthy underlying performance combined with the impact of the receivables transaction I discussed earlier.", "We expect to invest about $2.3 billion in the U.S. in 2013. While that amount is in line with our U.S. capital investment in 2011 and 2012, the mix continues to shift toward investments beyond our stores. In fact, for 2013, the sum of our U.S. investments in supply chain and technology, including multichannel, will likely be as high as our investments in new stores and remodels.", "In the U.S. credit card segment, we expect the portfolio to continue to slowly decline in size until it stabilizes at between $5.5 billion and $6 billion. We expect the portfolio will continue to generate outstanding profitability, both before and after it is sold to TD Bank Group. And we expect delinquencies and writeoffs to stabilize near current historically low levels.", "As I mentioned before, we continue to expect to close the deal before the end of the first quarter, causing GAAP EPS to reflect some one-time items, including a gain on sale and the recording of a beneficial interest receivable on our balance sheet.", "We posted a document outlining those expected impacts last October when we announced the agreement, and it\u2019s still available on the website. If you have additional questions about these one-time items, John Hulbert and I will be happy to discuss them with you after this call.", "Beyond expected one-time items that we\u2019ll exclude from our adjusted EPS measure, we continue to expect the transaction will reduce our adjusted EPS by about $0.10 in the 12 months following the closing, compared with a scenario in which we kept the portfolio. ", "This impact reflects the sharing of a portion of the portfolio of profits for TD, partially offset by the benefit of reduced interest expense and lower share count as we deploy proceeds from the sale. We expect to provide more color on the impact of the sale once the closing date for the transaction is known. ", "Turning to the Canadian segment, as we\u2019ve discussed with many of you, the sites we obtained in the Zellers deal were extremely well located with very attractive leases. They were notably smaller than stores we opened in the U.S., and in very poor physical condition. As a result, when we announced the Zellers deal, we indicated that we expected to invest $10-11 million per existing building to make them into brand new Target stores.", "Also at the time, we indicated that we were working with Canadian landlords to understand which of those sites might have adjacent open space and whether we would have an opportunity to invest capital in an expansion when it made financial sense. As a result of these discussions, I\u2019m happy to tell you that of the 124 stores we expect to open in 2013, we have decided to expand 40 sites beyond the space they occupied as Zeller stores, creating more than 600,000 square feet of incremental retail selling space.", "For each expansion, we have made a separate underwriting decision in which we measured the added investment against the incremental cash flow we believe a larger building will generate. All in, we expect to invest about $1.5 billion of capital in the Canadian segment in 2013, as we complete renovations and expansions for this year\u2019s openers, and begin work on additional stores to open in 2014. ", "In 2013, we expect Canadian segment to generate approximately $0.45 of dilution to our GAAP EPS, as the cost to open and operate Canadian stores, along with the depreciation related to our capital investments, offsets the profitability we generate from the locations after they open. Dilution is expected to exceed $0.45 through the first three quarters, after which we expect the segment to contribute several cents of positive GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter. ", "Even with total 2013 capital investment close to $4 billion, we expect to return meaningful amounts of capital to shareholders. Specifically, we expect to continue our uninterrupted record of paying quarterly dividends, and we recommend that our board improve another increase to the annual dividend later in the year. In addition, in 2013 we expect to be able to invest another $1.5 billion or so in share repurchase beyond the $600 million or more we expect to invest in share repurchase as a result of the receivables sale.", "Finally, we expect our 2013 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.7% to 36.7%. Altogether, these expectations lead to a full year 2013 adjusted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.05. Many of you will note that the center point of this range would put us slightly below the smooth path to attaining our long range financial plan in the U.S. This reflects the fact that 2013 is indeed a year of transition, including an expected $0.08 to $0.09 of near term dilution to adjusted EPS from the receivables sale that should [unintelligible] neutrality, and ultimately accretion over the next few years.", "We remain fully committed and on track to attain our long range financial plan of $8 or more in earnings per share in 2017. For full year 2013, we expect full year GAAP EPS will be about $0.15 than adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.45 of dilution related to our Canadian segment, offset by one-time accounting impacts of the receivables sale.", "Let\u2019s turn finally to our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S. retail segment, as you know, in addition to economic uncertainty we face a tough comparison due to the exceptionally strong sales we delivered in the first quarter of last year. As a result, we expect to generate first quarter comparable store sales sales growth of 0% to 2% in the U.S. ", "Like some others that have reported, sales results have been softer than expected so far in February, and daily volatility has been elevated. Yet trends have improved somewhat as the month has progressed, and it\u2019s still early in the quarter, so we believe our guidance is appropriate.", "In the U.S. retail segment, we expect our first quarter EBITDA margin rate to be somewhat higher than last year, driven by improvements in both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates. Our gross margin forecast anticipates category rate improvements, combined with the impact of the vendor payment geography shift, which are expected to offset ongoing pressure from 5% Rewards and our store remodel program.", "Our SG&A forecast anticipates continued expense discipline throughout the organization, combined with the impact of [unintelligible] portfolio profit sharing, which we expect to offset vendor payment geography and continued pressure from our multichannel investments. We also expect some leverage on D&A compared with last year. ", "Together, these expectations for our U.S. retail segment lead to expected first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. Looking to Canada, we expect that the first quarter will mark the peak of dilution attributable to this segment, at about $0.23. However, this is expected to be more than offset by accounting gains from the receivables sale, leading to an expectation of first quarter GAAP EPS in the range of $1.22 to $1.32.", "One comment on the expected cadence of the U.S. sales throughout 2013. Within our first quarter outlook, we obviously expect comparable store sales growth to strengthen later in the year, namely in the second and third quarters. Like last year, we have an appropriately tempered view of fourth quarter sales.", "As I mentioned earlier, 2013 will be a transition year, not just for our P&L, but for our capital plan as well, as we expect peak investment in Canada, the mix of our U.S. capital investment to move increasingly into technology and distribution in support of our multichannel strategy, and we divest our credit card receivables assets. ", "Following this year, our current view of 2014 has us fully on, or above, the path outlined in our long-range financial plan, benefitting from Canadian segment accretion and a meaningful increase in the amount of capital available to return to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Gregg for a few brief closing remarks. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "That concludes today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now, Kathy, John, and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Could you give us a little outlook on what free cash flow is going to look like once Canada is over on the $1.5 billion of spend? And where do you expect to deploy that? Is it going to be tilted more towards share repurchase, or how do you look at that? ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Obviously this year, 2013, will be peak capital investment in Canada, about $1.5 billion. Next year, going forward, capex for the U.S. we\u2019d expect something similar, perhaps growing a little bit, $2.5 billion, something in that range, Canada dropping to somewhere - we\u2019re still opening a fair number of stores, a half a billion, perhaps a bit more than that. So we would expect free cash flow to expand, especially in light of Canada operations becoming accretive. ", "As far as what we would intend to do with that, we said first, by 2017, assuming we get to $8 a share, we would expect the dividend to be at $3 a share or more, so we\u2019d expect to continue to increase the dividend at a rate approximately 20% on a compound basis over the next several years. And, with the constraint of living within our current strong investment grade credit ratings, we\u2019d expect to deploy the remainder of our excess cash flow as share repurchase. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "And can you give us a little more color on the Canada dilution of $0.45? I think that\u2019s bigger than a lot of people were expecting. It sounds like a lot of it is related to the capital spending decision. So if you could walk us through that a little bit.", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "I think that\u2019s right, Mark. When we look back, where we\u2019re at right now with Canada, we feel really good about where we\u2019re at in our projections for returns in Canada. If we look back a year ago or even two years ago, and we sign the deal, our projected EBITDA for this year, is essentially right on where we thought it would be. ", "The dilution is a bit higher even than we expected perhaps a year ago, and all of that is attributable to independent capital investment decisions we\u2019ve made, whether that\u2019s investing in three distribution centers to build them and own them ourselves, or the 40 store expansions that I mentioned that we worked through over the past year. So most of the increase from our vantage point is attributable to incremental depreciation and amortization. ", "And of course those capital investments were separate economic decisions, and we expect to see economic benefit to that P&L through time, but the sequencing is that the depreciation and amortization shows up first. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley ", "And also, you talked about the percent rent clauses in Canada. I know you got out of some of those.", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Yeah, the property development team did an outstanding job working with some very good partners, our landlords in Canada, and the vast majority of the percent rent clauses, which of course never impacted Zellers, have been negotiated away. Percent rent is not a meaningful issue for us going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. ", "Greg Melich - ISI Group ", "I have a couple of questions. First, John, on the leverage, once credit\u2019s gone, we get your debt to EBITDAR around 1.7, 1.8, could you put some context into how high you think that can or should go, given everything in terms of being great credit rating, as you take the dividend out?  Should we model sort of a 2 as a capital? How should we think about that? ", "John Mulligan ", "I think what I would say is right now as we look at the retail business and model that, we\u2019ve always modeled that kind of independently of the credit business, given the different leverage characteristics, as you noted. We think the retail business right now is probably pretty close to the top end. There may be a little bit of room. But we think it\u2019s near about where the leverage which will support our current credit rating is at.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group ", "So the incremental buyback is really the equity from the credit business?", "John Mulligan ", "Correct, for 2013 that\u2019s correct.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group ", "And then secondly, maybe a bigger question for Kathy or Gregg, the Red Card growth, compared to, say, three years ago, has, I think, beaten all of our expectations. Certainly mine. It looks like last year it was up over 50%. Could you help us understand a little bit more about that 50% growth in Red Card sales? How much of it is from new Red Card members? How much of it is existing members spending more? Anything you could provide there would be helpful.", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Sure, the increase in Red Card sales is a mix of both. Certainly the new accounts are creating a significant amount of that lift, with the amount of accounts. And you know, you can see the increased penetration resulting from new accounts. But we have also seen increased lift, particularly over the first several quarters that the Red Card was out in existing accounts. ", "The other thing I would mention, the big driver here of the increase in sales, as has been the case, the big driver in the increase of the whole program, has been the debit card, and I think from our assumptions perhaps two or three years ago, when we were talking to you to now, the debit card is the one that has really surprised us. ", "The credit card has probably gone pretty much with what we thought, but the debit card, we\u2019re doing three accounts to one debit to credit now, and that has been the product that is incredibly attractive to consumers who just don\u2019t want another credit card. And that\u2019s really what has driven the significant increase in our Red Card sales. ", "John Mulligan ", "The other thing that I would add is all of our guest segments love the Red Card somewhat equally, whether you\u2019re a VIP, which we would say is somebody who visits us a lot and spends a lot, all the way through our enthusiasts, convenience users, least engaged. All of those segments, once they get the Red Card, move toward visiting Target more often and spending more. So this is not just isolated in one group or demographic. It\u2019s very well dispersed and balanced. And we think that\u2019s a very positive attribute, that that many guest segments love the Red Card. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray. ", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ", "Maybe just first, John, a clarification question on the $8 in EPS for 2017. I think before that was predicated on a 2% or more U.S. annual U.S. store growth. Do you still think that\u2019s the appropriate number to get to that $7.20 from the U.S. business?", "John Mulligan ", "The actual assumption for the U.S. business was about a 3 comp through time, and you know, some years will be a little bit above that, some years a little bit below that. But we think 3 comp is about the right level for our business. If you look back at our business over a really really long period of time, you know, back when we were running 5 comps, a couple hundred basis points of that were coming from new stores as they annualized, and we ran about a 3 comp in our base business. And over the last couple of years, since 2010, last year a little bit lower, 2011 right on, we feel like that\u2019s the right neighborhood for where we can run the business.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ", "And then also on the guidance for this year, and just thinking about the modeling, it sounds like you\u2019re opening up a few more waves in Canada than your normal store opening cadence. Just from a modeling perspective, how should we think about some of those store openings this year? And then just as a follow up to the U.S., how does the real estate development market feel to you guys out there?", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Well, typically in the U.S. we open stores in three cycles. Due to the number of stores we had in Canada, we\u2019re taking the approach that we\u2019re going to open five cycles this year. So think April, May, and every couple of months beyond that, we\u2019re going to open somewhere between 20 and 28 stores a cycle. ", "We haven\u2019t defined all of that yet, but we\u2019re going to start in the greater Toronto area, then we\u2019re going to move to Western Canada, then we\u2019ll densify, then we\u2019ll go east, and then we\u2019ll densify again. So we\u2019ve got a good plan that is centered around our supply chain investments and the readiness of our distribution centers, and we just think it makes sense to spread out those kinds of openings over more cycles than we typically would do in the U.S.", "And your other question?", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ", "Just how does the U.S. real estate development market feel in the U.S.? Does it feel like it\u2019s loosening up a little bit? Maybe a few more opportunities, you guys are holding back a little bit at this point, and looking to be a little bit more prudent in the growth?", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "We\u2019re not holding back at all. We\u2019re not capital constrained, and we\u2019re pursuing every project that we can find that\u2019s going to generate the right kind of a return. So I would tell you that the commercial real estate market is pretty much status quo, and hasn\u2019t changed all that much over the last couple of years. ", "There are pockets of opportunity, and we\u2019re anxious to either codevelop or develop on our own, or be a partner in any development where we believe that it\u2019s the right demographics, and we can generate the right kind of return. So we\u2019re not holding back at all. It\u2019s just the environment is still a little cautious and a lot slower than we\u2019d like it to be, and hopefully things will change over the next couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. ", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ", "John, can you give us a sense of what the revenue assumption is that\u2019s baked into that $0.45 Canada dilution number this year?", "John Mulligan ", "The revenue number I would tell you continues to move around even here for the reasons Gregg just outlined. Store opening schedules continue to move around. We\u2019ve only really set in place in concrete the first two. The rest of them still moving around a little bit. So we\u2019re hesitant to provide pretty specific guidance. But what I would tell you is the expectation is that these stores will open and grow and have a very similar annualization process to what we see in the U.S. So I think that\u2019s probably the most important assumption, and the revenue will move around based on what stores we get open when.", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ", "And then I think in the past you guys have said that you\u2019d expect to recapture the Canadian losses that you accrue within two years of turning profitable. So if you sum up the last three years - well, the last two years plus this year - it\u2019s a little over $1, maybe $1.10. Do you still expect to get that back in earnings from Canada in \u201914 or \u201915? Or is the D&A going to make that a longer process?", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Yeah, I think you hit on it. It will be a little bit longer. We\u2019re not talking about five years or anything like that, but 2.5, 3 years, something like that our current modeling would say we\u2019ll get it back in. Something like that. So a bit more than 2 years.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays. ", "Bob Drbul - Barclays", "Just had a question on the fourth quarter in general. Over the past few years, you guys have really made a nice tradeoff between profitability and comps, and this year it seemed to break down a little bit more than usual, where you\u2019ve made a decision not to be a Black Friday door buster competitor, but the gross margins were down 60 basis points or so. Can you talk a little bit about what you learned from the traffic being down and gross margins being down, sort of how you might attack it differently in the fourth quarter of this year?", "Kathryn Tesija ", "You know, Bob, I would say that we actually think we performed quite well on Black Friday. We saw the barbell intensify as Gregg mentioned, between those early sales in Black Friday, and then the lull and then coming back strong at the end of the holiday. ", "For us it was more about pretty weak seasonal businesses. The weather, as you know, was very warm, and our seasonal businesses, which normally kick in in early November, didn\u2019t. And then with all of the, we think, economic turmoil and the elections, and fiscal cliff, and all of that, that it created that lull in between Black Friday and Christmas. ", "So we\u2019ve talked about planning conservatively for this past year, and we will again for next year for the fourth quarter. And we think that the opportunity to pick up sales is really the other three quarters. And in particular, the second and third quarters this year. So we continue to manage our business, our goal is to maintain or grow gross margins within categories. ", "As you know, it was a very competitive year this year, and what we dropped was mainly reflecting the ongoing impact of 5% Rewards and PFresh combined with a little higher clearance in some of our seasonal categories. ", "But all in all, I think the team did a great job of managing our inventory. We did come out very clean. Our inventory headed into the first quarter was exactly where it was last year on a per-store basis. So we feel great about that. ", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "The other thing I would add is you have to take a look at the mix of our business too and there was industry softness in electronics and toys, which are really important to us. There was not any must-have really super-hot new products that really drove consumers into the stores. And as others have reported, the toy business was a little softer than expected. And the same was true in electronics, as we were post-peak in terms of the digital cycles and video game business in particular were softer, and that\u2019s a huge business for us. ", "So just the cyclical nature of some of these businesses, in addition to what Kathy said, caused comps to be a bit softer than we expected. But we are not bashful about being hypercompetitive, and we want to be really super competitive every year as we head into the holiday season. But we also want to have a balanced approach in making sure that it\u2019s not all about market share. We want to gain market share, but do so profitably, and trying to find that right mix. And that\u2019s the approach we\u2019ll continue to take. ", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.", "Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ", "On a similar topic of competition, obviously you introduced the price match guarantee as a step in the right direction. But given that that\u2019s such a very low portion of the total transactions, do you think you need to do more on just everyday price and staying more competitive than perhaps you even are today?", "Gregg Steinhafel ", "Well, we\u2019re competitive day in and day out. We have always maintained the position that we\u2019re going to be competitive in the marketplace. That\u2019s a position that we\u2019ve taken, and as we continue to learn more, and as more business migrates to the online channels, we\u2019re going to continue to sharpen up our online prices in that channel as well, and be competitive with those competitors that are most meaningful in that channel.", "So there will be some sharpening up there, but I would tell you, we offer fantastic value day in and day out. Our pricing strategy has not changed, and as we look across the competitive landscape, we\u2019re very, very well-positioned.", "Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ", "Just one more if I could. Can you just walk us through the path to $0.10 dilution getting to neutral over a few years? What causes that to happen, on the credit card sale?", "John Mulligan ", "The biggest impact is the impact of share repurchase as that levers against growing profits is the short story on that, Dan, and we\u2019re happy to spend a little bit more time with you if you\u2019d like. But that\u2019s the short story.", "", "Okay, well, thank you very much. That concludes Target\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 21, 2013.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 second quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I will provide a high level summary of our second quarter results and strategic priorities for the rest of the year, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights, and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Following John\u2019s remarks, we\u2019ll open up the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "Target\u2019s second quarter financial results reflect strong U.S. profit performance in spite of soft traffic and sales. Our second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2% below our expectations going into the quarter, but nearly 2 percentage points ahead of our first quarter pace. As a result, we delivered second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19 at the high end of our expectation going into the quarter. Our GAAP EPS of $0.95 was in the middle of our expected range, reflecting higher than expected dilution of $0.21 from our Canadian segment. As we monitor the economy and consumer sentiment, we continue to see a mix of signals in which emerging optimism is balanced with continuing challenges. This year\u2019s payroll tax increase continues to affect spending, particularly among lower and [moderate] [ph] income households and household formation in younger demographic groups remain stubbornly negative.", "Recent job growth numbers have been encouraging, but labor force participation and income growth remain weak. And while emerging strength in the housing and automotive sectors is a long term positive, the near term spending on these big ticket items is crowding out other spending particularly in today\u2019s environment in which access to consumer credit remains tight. As you\u2019ve heard from all operators and other retailers we continue to see the impact of trip consolidation in U.S. households as our second quarter comp was entirely driven by an increase in basket size partially offset by a small decline in traffic. Second quarter sales in our digital channels grew in the teens overall with mobile traffic and sales continuing to grow at a triple digit pace.", "Second quarter operating margins in the U.S. were quite strong especially in light of the pace of our sales. We delivered a healthy gross margin rate as we saw a relatively balanced mix of sales across categories and our merchant teams did a great job managing inventory and price investments. In addition we continue to benefit from very disciplined management of expenses particularly in our stores. In fact excluding the impact of the decline in the contribution from our credit card portfolio U.S. segment operating margins increased from last year\u2019s second quarter.", "Altogether we feel very good about our second quarter U.S. segment performance as we overcame softer than expected sales and the year-over-year impact of credit card profit sharing to deliver a 6.1% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results demonstrate the resilience of our team and our operating model in the face of a challenging economic and consumer environment.", "In our Canadian segment we have reached the half-way point in our 2013 market launch. We opened another 44 Canadian Target stores in the second quarter putting our total at 68 today on the way to our goal of operating 124 Canadian stores by year end.", "Launching our Canadian segment has required a massive effort from teams throughout the company including building a completely new supply chain infrastructure and integrated technology solution completely reconstructing former Zellers transforming them into brand new Target stores, hiring and training more than 15,000 Canadian team members and creating unique merchandize strategies and assortments to fit the preferences of our Canadian guests including a very strong presence in our home and apparel categories.", "The team\u2019s execution on these efforts has been excellent, as a result our Canadian stores have seen strong initial traffic and the mix of our sales in home and apparel has been even higher than expected. However, now that we have successfully opened 68 stores in Canada we need to drive trips and conversion in frequency categories like healthcare, food and other basic commodities. Sales in these categories have grown much more slowly than we expected causing overall sales and profit momentum to build more slowly as well.", "Multiple serve indicate that our prices are very competitive and right where they need to be when compared to competition at local markets. Yet we know there is a gap in guest awareness of how low our prices really are. As a result we\u2019re deploying multiple tactics to help our guest better understand the great value and convenience we provide in these categories.", "Overtime we expect these efforts will drive greater awareness of the assortment and value we provide on these frequently purchased items leading our Canadian guest to regularly shop Target for a balance of both wants and needs. Our expectations are informed by our experience, our experience in launching the (inaudible) remodel program and city Target format as well as our historical experience entering new markets in the U.S.", "In many of these markets we saw similar pattern in with sales momentum with slower than expected at the launch grew rapidly in the first several years after opening resulting in achievement of our 5th year sales goals. For the stores we have opened the team in Canada is working to adjust inventory and store staffing to match the pace of sales in each individual location and for the segment in total we have updated the expected timing of earnings accretion.", "Having said that we remain highly confident in our strategy, we\u2019re very pleased with the look and feel of these new stores and we have an outstanding Canadian team. We have invested in this segment to position it for long term success and we continue to believe we will achieve our longer term financial goals in Canada. Across the company we are moving quickly to position our business to succeed in a rapidly changing retail environment. This requires our team to stay laser focused on near term execution while simultaneously allocating resources and effort to initiatives that will drive longer term sales growth and profitability. Recent examples of this, includes the beta launch of Cartwheel, our mobile coupon platform on Facebook that has experienced rapid growth since launch in April. This platform which immigrates our stores and mobile into guest social networks has seen very high levels of guest engagement. In fact, our partners at Facebook have told us that engagement statistics for Cartwheel are among the best they have seen in the beta stage of any app both within and outside the retail space.", "We are also dividing meaningful resources to enhance the flexibility of our fulfillment networks, which includes our stores, regional distribution centers, online fulfillment centers, and import warehouses. In addition, we are investing in data systems that will provide a single holistic view across vendors\u2019 items or distribution infrastructure and stores that will allow us to more efficiently and seamlessly fulfill guest demand in whatever channel they choose. And we are pleased with our recent agreement to acquire the DermStore Beauty Group. This unique opportunity, which follows our acquisitions of Chefs.com and Cooking.com earlier in the year provide us insight into superior online experience DermStore provides along with access to brands, contents, and resources that are valuable to our guests.", "As we look to the remainder of the year and beyond, we are taking steps to drive guest traffic both today and over time. We are steadfast in our commitment to provide value to guests who continue to shop cautiously investing in everyday low prices and even lower prices in our weekly circular and flyer combined with compelling discounts available on Cartwheel. We reinforced this commitment to value with price matching policies for both online and local print ads from competitors and 5% REDcard Rewards and Pharmacy Rewards allows guests to save even more off or already great prices. The continued rapid adoption of both of these programs demonstrates the value they provide for our guests. Beyond low prices, we work to differentiate our assortment and guest experience by partnering with designers and others to provide unique unexpected value-added products and services. For example, in our stores, we are adding service elements to categories, including beauty and electronics. And outside our stores, we will continue to explore acquisition opportunities to augment our digital capabilities, content, and brands.", "Additionally, we are building the digital acumen of the organization through hiring and collaborations with leading technology partners. For example, our recently opened Technology Innovation Center in San Francisco provides us the opportunity to benefit from technology talent in the area and rapidly explore opportunities that can be brought to Target, accelerating the pace of our innovation and adoption of emerging technologies and trends. And we are building the capability to operate stores in smaller spaces, particularly in urban markets. We are analyzing results in our first 70 Target stores to understand where in the stores we have the ability to reduce space even more allowing us to further shrink the size of this store format.", "Ultimately, we believe we will succeed over time by providing value to our guests in the world of and, where we provide the ability to continually shop in stores and digital channels, enjoyable shopping for both wants and needs, access to great design and low prices, and the ability to save money with an ethical company that supports the communities where we operate. At Target, we have long understood the power of and which is summed up by our brand promise to expect more and pay less. We believe this promise is more relevant than ever in today\u2019s environment and we are committed across the organization to delivering on it every day in every channel.", "Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to take a moment to thank the Target team for their outstanding effort in this challenging environment. The team has already accomplished a lot this year successfully launching a record number of stores outside the U.S. for the first time selling our credit card portfolio to an outstanding partner in TD Bank and preserving profitability in a softer than expected sales environment in the U.S. Throughout the organization, we are focused on becoming more nimble moving quickly to test and learn from new initiatives. I am proud of this team and confident that our efforts will position Target for long-term success.", "Now, Kathy will provide more detail on second quarter results outline its initiatives for the third quarter, and beyond. Kathy?", "", "Kathy Tesija", "Thanks Gregg. We are very pleased with the ability of our team to manage inventory and profitability in our U.S. business during a quarter in which consumer shop consciously and competitors promote it heavily to clear access inventory. In our second quarter U.S. results we saw a relatively narrow spread in comparable sales between the strongest and softest performing categories. Not surprisingly sales in less discretionary areas like food, healthcare and household essentials grew somewhat faster than the company average. However sales in our home category also grew faster than the company average driven by particular strength in our domestics and stationary categories. Among the other more discretionary categories, second quarter comparable sales in both apparel and hardlines declined slightly.", "Within apparel our children\u2019s categories had the strongest results while the more discretionary women\u2019s assortments experienced softer results in the space of a very promotional environment.", "We continue to deliver excitement through limited time partnerships with influential designers who help us differentiate target an support and expect more pay less brand promise. In the second quarter we were very pleased with the results of our collaboration with Lauren Bush Lauren and FEED USA featuring products and home, sporting goods, stationary, apparel and accessories. Beyond the merchandize this unique program reinforced our commitment to communities as Target provided more than 10 million meals for U.S. families through this collaboration.", "We\u2019re also very pleased with the initial results for the beta launch of Cartwheel, a differentiated mobile experience that delivers value for our guests. We launched the Cartwheel app on the iOS and Android platforms in June and it's already a Top 20 lifestyle app in the Apple Store. Cartwheel is growing rapidly; it currently has more than a million users who have saved more than $2 million so far.", "Among active users more than 50% have completed multiple Cartwheel transactions demonstrating the power of the program to drive sustained guest engagement. As expected guests are searching for deals while they are shopping in stores and we have seen redemption rates in excess of 50% for offers downloaded by guests while they are shopping.", "We\u2019re pleased with these initial results and will apply what we have learned to improve both the Cartwheel experience as well as the development of our multi-channel experiences in the future. Beyond new mobile experiences like Cartwheel our overall mobile sales and traffic continued to grow at a rapid pace to build on this momentum we\u2019re investing to enhance feed, search, product information and check-out on our mobile site and this fall we will be begin testing other innovations to enhance the in-store mobile experience including way finding and improved search.", "And we continue to invest to further integrate the shopping experience across channels based on successful results from our team member test of buy online and pickup and in-store, we\u2019re moving quickly to begin offering this option for guests in this third quarter.", "We will begin in the Minneapolis market before expanding the role to other markets, we expect to complete the role to all stores by the holiday season. Simultaneously we\u2019re planning team member tests of other flexible with capabilities which will begin later this year including the ability to deliver online orders from stores as early as the same day and the ability to pay in one store and pick-up another. Based on the results of the team member test we will look to move to guest facing tests next year. And beyond investments to build on our own digital offering we continue to monitor the landscape to identify opportunities to augment our capabilities through acquisitions. The recent decision to acquire DermStore reflects a strategic opportunity for Target to learn from their online expertise, customer service, content development and product curation which combines to create an exceptional online beauty experience.", "In addition DermStore\u2019s broad assortment of prestige and dermatology brands will complete Target\u2019s product offerings. We continue to approach the economic and competitive environment with longer term optimism but near term caution, with over consumer confidence statistics have improved this year it's notable that optimism among lower income households is lagging behind and as Greg mentioned this year\u2019s payroll tax increase and consumer spending on autos and housing are crowding out spending on other goods and services, for example in survey\u2019s regarding expected spending on back to school and back to college items consumers indicate they intend to spend less than a year ago by focusing on sales, discounts and reusing items they already own. As a result in preparing for the third quarter and beyond, we are building flexibility into our inventory plans and creating merchandise and marketing programs focused on driving traffic and sales with compelling offers, innovative partnerships, and key seasonal programs.", "Target is known for delivering key seasons for our guests and only the fourth quarter holiday season is bigger than back-to-school and back-to-college. This year we have created a multi-layer strategy to deliver a great guest experience and outstanding value. For back-to-school, we are offering parents a convenient one-stop-shop for all the must-have items on their shopping list at a price, at a range of price points to accommodate a variety of household budgets, including hundreds of unique items in fashion, school supplies, and accessories for less than $20. In fact, we have nearly 400 items for $1 or less clearly demonstrating our commitment to deliver value.", "Our back-to-school direct mail catalog includes more than $25 worth of coupons, and we have increased the number of online coupons this year as well. And of course, parents who use their Target REDcard will receive 5% off their entire purchase and free shipping on every order from Target.com. To support our back-to-school merchandising that has broadcast themes in various lengths and languages, which focused on telling stories around iconic school moments that make kids feel like real life heroes. In addition to the unique Kids Got Style Instagram program, Target\u2019s celebrated kids as the most original style leaders. Earlier this month, parents could Instagram a picture of their children showing off their individual style. Target stylists use select photos as inspiration to create Kids Got Style mood boards of colors, fashion items, and supplies inspired by each child\u2019s unique style, which were posted to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Parents were tagged, so they could view and share the photos to their social networks as inspiration for the new school year.", "Because we know that quality education is the number one social priority for our guests, it\u2019s also the number one focus of our giving programs. So, following last year\u2019s success, we are excited about the return of our Give With Target program, through which Target will donate $5 million to schools across the country. Last year, our guests impacted more than 30,000 schools through donations from this program, which were used to purchase classroom resources like electronics, office supplies, and storage and organization products. New this year, Target is inviting guests to allocate the full donation, double the amount designated by guests last year to schools of their choice. For back-to-college, we have created innovative resources and new live experiences both online and in person to provide the inspiration and tools to make shopping fun and easy.", "Last month, Target introduced a first of its kind online live experience featuring popular YouTube personalities and live-sized virtual dorms. From July 15th through the 18th, visitors were invited to shop Target products from the dorm rooms, enter to win college gear, and to interact with the roommates. Also online, we have created uStyler, a style focused design resource that puts students in the driver seat as they put together their unique dorm room look, looks can be named, saved, and shared on their favorite social media sites, where their friends are able to shop them. And we have created the checklist, a customizable list of key products available in store and at Target.com to help students shop for this for small-space living.", "On campus, Target is hosting 95 shopping events for incoming freshman around the country as part of welcome week festivities. These events include after our shopping events, which provides free bus transportation to and from our store, where students will be able to shop for everything they need and want. Halloween is also a key season for Target and the holiday falls in our third quarter this year. We plan to deliver this season with a multi-channel approach focused on driving traffic and growing our market share. We will offer a comprehensive assortment of costumes and accessories for the whole family, including parents, kids, and pets. We will offer a dominant presentation in our stores and extend the assortment on Target.com.", "In home, Target\u2019s product design and development team has created an innovative collection of Halloween d\u00e9cor ranging from classic too scary to help mom decorate her home inside and out for the big night. As Gregg mentioned, we are increasingly focused on differentiating our store experience through enhanced service, the baby category is already one of our signature strengths but we believe we have an opportunity to further deepen relationships with guests who are entering this life stage. Expected parents establish new shopping habits and it's a time when they are looking for easy shopping solutions to save time.", "As a result we\u2019re continually exploring new ways to elevate the shopping experience for expected parents, for example in 10 Chicago stores we are testing an interactive shopping experience which features accessible product displays including featured fixtures with mannequins to showcase outfits and allow guest to touch and try our products. There is also a collaboration center in the area where guests can sit comfortable, access the register or get personalized assistance from a team member. Digital tools on hand such as iPads also provide guests easy online access to product information. Another part of the store where we see an opportunity for enhanced service is our beauty area based on results from our Chicago market test of the Beauty Concierge program we rolled out the concept to an additional stores in the second quarter including stores in LA, Washington DC, Baltimore and Minneapolis markets.", "These beauty consultants are brand agnostic and provide guests with detailed, unbiased information on all beauty and personal care categories in the store including product attributes and ingredient benefits servicing as a knowledgeable source and a friendly face in what can often be an intimidating category.", "We believe this program serves to differentiate Target in the beauty space, while still meeting guest needs for value and convenience. And of course in the third quarter we will continue to introduce unique merchandise throughout our assortments to deliver newness and excitement for our guests. For example this fall we\u2019re excited to be partnering with Philip Lim, Philip is a designer we have been watching for years, his aesthetic, (inaudible) yet under stated and it's focused on democratizing beautiful fashion makes him a perfect fit for our brand. Beginning September 15th, Target will offer a limited edition collection of apparel and accessories including an assortment of bag, shoes and scarves for men and women at most target stores and target.com.", "Prices will range from $20 to $300 with most items under $50. The entire Philip Lim for Target collection will be presented in the women\u2019s apparel department when it debuts in our stores allowing guest to find the entire collection in one easy to shop area of the store. After the first week we plan to move items to their respective departments within the store.", "In late September, we will launch a new line of men\u2019s pants from Haggar called Haggar H26. Haggar is a premium brand in men\u2019s pants and we\u2019re excited to offer a no iron premium khaki in a classic fit, performance slacks in a classic fit and original chino in a straight fit. And in beauty earlier this month we expanded our hair care assortment with the exclusive launch of Toni & Guy Hair Meet Wardrobe, a premium hair care line introduced in the UK in 2011. Available for the first time in the U.S. at Target stores and on target.com, Hair Meet Wardrobe includes a full range of shampoos, conditioners, hair accessories and styling tools and range in price from $5 to $40. And finally we continue to feature exclusive partnerships with influential artists. Reigning Academy of Country Music Entertainer of the year, Luke Bryan teamed up with Target for his latest release Crash My Party which [set] [ph] last week.", "The Target exclusive deluxe edition of the album contains four bonus tracks, and following last spring\u2019s success we\u2019re thrilled that once again we\u2019re partnering with Justin Timberlake to release a special edition of the continuation of his third studio album the 20/20 Experience 2 of 2 featuring two exclusive bonus tracks. Guests can preorder the album now on target.com or purchase online or in-stores beginning September 30th.", "While we continue to experience the impact of cautious consumer spending and trip consolidation we continue to innovate across all our channels to provide our guest unbeatable value and unique experiences. We\u2019re confident we have the right plans in place for the third quarter and we\u2019re moving quickly to ensure we stay relevant in an increasingly digital marketplace. Now John will share his insights on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the third quarter and the full year. John?", "", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, Kathy. We are very pleased with our second quarter U.S. segment financial performance as the team generated outstanding profitability despite softer than expected traffic and sales. Second quarter U.S. segment comparable sales increased 1.2%. Sales strengthened somewhat as the quarter progressed and were further aided by this year\u2019s calendar shift, which moved some early back-to-school sales into July. Like many other retailers, we continue to see the impact of trip consolidation among U.S. consumers as average transaction size drove more than 100% of our comparable sales growth, reflecting increases in both item per basket and average retail per unit.", "Year-over-year penetration of sales on our proprietary debit and credit cards grew nearly 600 basis points in the second quarter, and for the first time in our history, debit penetration moved beyond credit. The debit card has proven to be the engine that has propelled REDcard Rewards beyond our initial stretch goals. It is the right product for a large set of guests who simply don\u2019t want another credit card in their wallet. We continue to measure the change in household spending when guests begin using one of our debit or credit cards. And we continue to see on average a 50% increase in household spending when guests apply for and activate one of our cards.", "Second quarter gross margin rate in the U.S. was 31.4%, up slightly from last year. As I outlined last quarter, this year we have made changes to our vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of our marketing programs, which creates equivalent year-over-year increases in our U.S. segment gross margin and SG&A expense rates. These changes raised our second quarter gross margin rate by about 20 basis points. Excluding the benefit from vendor payments, gross margin would have declined slightly as our growth driving REDcard Rewards and PFresh remodel programs created moderate pressure, which was partially offset by rate improvements within merchandise categories. The merchant teams also did a great job managing receipts in the face of softer than expected sales.", "At the end of the quarter, average inventory per store in the U.S. was up only 1.8% from a year ago. As expected, on the SG&A expense line, we continue to see the impact of a smaller contribution from the credit card portfolio, which we sold to TD Bank in March. And while we have tried to do a thorough job last quarter explaining the impact of the sale and the associated change in our segment reporting, we have received feedback from some of you that we could have done a better job. You know who you are.", "So, to provide greater clarity this quarter, let\u2019s go back a year and revisit our second quarter 2012 U.S. credit card segment results in which we earned EBIT of $143 million. This segment EBIT reflected the impact of $74 million in profit sharing with the U.S. retail segment, which was described as loyalty program charges in our financial statements. So, in total, the corporation earned EBIT from the credit card portfolio of $217 million, $143 million in the U.S. credit card segment and $74 million in the U.S. retail segment. Importantly, all of this $217 million is reflected in the revised 2012 results for our new U.S. segment.", "Moving now to the second quarter 2013, we received profit sharing of $183 million from TD, which was partially offset by approximately $65 million of our expense to service accounts on their behalf meaning second quarter contribution from the credit card portfolio was about $118 million, down about $100 million from a year ago. Two other things are important to remember. First, not all of the year-over-year decline in credit contribution was driven by the sales to TD as the portfolio is smaller than a year ago and we are annualizing a $30 million reserve release in second quarter 2012. Second, outside the U.S. segment, we continue to offset some of the impacts of profit sharing as we have deployed proceeds from the sale to reduce our net debt position and repurchase shares.", "With that as context, we can turn to our second quarter U.S. segment SG&A expense rate of 20.6%, which was up from 20.2% in last year\u2019s revised U.S. segment. More than 100% of this increase or about six tenths of a percentage point was driven by the decline and the contribution from the credit card portfolio. In addition, we continue to experience expense pressure from this year\u2019s incremental investments in technology and distribution in support of our multi-channel efforts. And finally, the change in vendor payments increased our SG&A expense rate by about 20 basis points. Offsetting these multiple pressures, we benefited from favorable leverage of compensation expenses including incentive compensation and for payroll. And we continue to benefit from our companywide expense optimization efforts which are identifying opportunities to increase productivity throughout the organization. All together our second quarter U.S. segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were down only slightly from last year\u2019s revised U.S. results. However without the headwind from the credit card portfolio those rates would have increased slightly. These results are outstanding and notably better than we could have expected in our quarter in which sales fell well short of our expected range. In our Canadian segment sales accelerated from the first quarter as we continue to open stores at a robust pace.", "However, we have seen slower than expected ramp up in sales following the grand opening rush particularly in our frequency categories. Second quarter red carpet penetration in Canada was 2.3% and consistent with our U.S. segment debit penetration was slightly ahead of credit. As we have seen in the U.S. since the launch of the program we expect red carpet penetration to continue to grow in Canada driving incremental sales across all categories. The Canadian segment earned second quarter gross margin of $87 million or 31.6% reflecting a very favorable mix of sales in the home apparel categories offset by the impact of some inventory clearance.", "Second quarter SG&A expenses were $ 207 million reflecting both ongoing operating expenses combined with meaningful startup expenses as we prepare to open new stores. All together second quarter dilution attributable to the Canadian segment including depreciation, amortization and interest expense recorded outside the segment was $0.21 compared with our estimate of $0.16 going in the quarter.", "Even in the year where we\u2019re making meaningful investments in distribution, technology and our Canadian market launch, we have been able to return a large amount of cash to our shareholders to dividends and share repurchase. In the second quarter, we paid dividends of $231 million and repurchased more than $900 million worth of our shares. Year-to-date we have paid dividends of nearly $0.5 billion and repurchased shares worth nearly $1.5 billion.", "And we were pleased to announce in June that our Board of Directors had approved a 19% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.36 to $0.43 per share as a result 2013 will mark the 42th consecutive year in which this company has increased it's annual dividend.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In the U.S. segment we\u2019re expecting third quarter comparable sales in the range of 1% to 2%, for this outlook it's somewhat ahead of our second quarter pace, it is supported by our experience so far in August and it reflects the benefit of this year\u2019s calendar shift which moves the Halloween holiday into October from last year\u2019s fiscal November.", "We expect a small decline in the gross margin rate compared with last year as that can be impact of our growth initiatives partially offset by the benefit of the vendor payment shift. We expect our third quarter SG&A expense rate will be approximately 21.4% reflecting about 60 basis points of pressure from a lower credit portfolio contribution and continued pressure from our multi-channel investments and the shift in vendor payments. Partially offset by ongoing benefit of our expense optimization efforts.", "All together these expectations deliver a third quarter EBITDA margin rate about a 4 percentage point below last year\u2019s third quarter revised U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate. In Canada the team continues to refine operations in the stores already opened ensuring that inventory and expenses match the current pace of sales in each individual store. It's important to note that we\u2019re still very early into our market launch and as Greg mentioned we\u2019re deploying multiple tactics to drive sales in our frequency categories overtime. However, given that we have initially positioned our expense structure, fulfillment network and inventory to support potential upside to our initial sales forecast we\u2019re incurring markdowns and higher than normal operating expense rates as we adjust to the current pace of sales. This has raised our dilution expectations for this segment through the end of the year.", "Specifically the third quarter we expect the Canadian segment will drive $0.22 of dilution to our consolidated earnings per share. In total we expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 and GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.65 reflecting Canada dilution along with $0.03 of expense from the unwind of the beneficial interest asset resulting from our credit card portfolio.", "For the full year we have become incrementally more cautious in our U.S. sales outlook, given our recent results and those of our competitors. We now expect the full year comparable sales increase of about 1%, down from our prior outlook for an increase of 2% to 2.5%. We believe planning for this pace is appropriate and will help to mitigate downside risk of taking a more aggressive inventory position. As always, Kathy\u2019s team remains prepared to chase business if the U.S. environment strengthens unexpectedly. Even with our more tempered sales expectation, we believe full year adjusted EPS will remain in the $4.70 to $4.90 range we provided previously, although our expectation has moved to the low end of that range.", "We expect full year GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.95 lower than adjusted EPS reflecting $0.82 of dilution from the Canadian segment combined with a net $0.13 of dilution from the credit card portfolio sale and associated debt repurchase. Down this year, we expect year-over-year EPS performance in the Canadian segment to improve meaningfully in 2014. While Canadian segment sales are starting from a different base than we expected, we have ample experience with U.S. market launches to give us confidence that we can drive stronger sales increases in the next several years and ultimately reach our longer term sales and profit goals. As we said many times, our experience in opening Target stores for more than 50 years has shown that we are much more accurate when explaining fifth year sales than first year sales. We are still very confident in our Canadian strategy, stores and team and continue to believe the segment will generate $0.80 or more of EPS in 2017.", "And finally, beginning next year, we expect to see a meaningful increase in cash available for dividends in share repurchase. Our U.S. operations continue to generate very strong cash flow. In addition, we expect capital expenditures in Canada to fall more than $1 billion in 2014 while U.S. capital expenditures are expected to stay essentially flat. The resulting increase in free cash flow will allow us to continue growing the dividend at our current 20% annual rate and meaningfully grow share repurchase from the current pace while maintaining our goal to preserve our current strong investment grade credit ratings.", "That concludes today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Gregg, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Hi. I guess just first question on the comp John I think you mentioned that it did get steadily better throughout the quarter, any additional color you could give us there? And then I guess on were there any regional differences that you could potentially isolate in terms of where some of the transaction weakness was in the quarter?", "", "John Mulligan", "I think on the, sequentially, yes, I mean, it improved month-to-month within the quarter. None of the quarters were negative, which compared to first quarter was significant progress. July was notably the strongest, but a portion that certainly was attributable to that back-to-school moving in from August last year. So, we did see a strengthening, but I wouldn\u2019t want to overplay that. Certainly a portion of it is attributable to the calendar. On geography wise, we have not seen anything meaningfully different in aggregate across the quarter in any one week or day, there is differences depending on when back-to-school starts on various portions of the country, but nothing meaningful across the country.", "", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, got it. And then I guess you talked about some lower advertised prices in circular, is this really just in Canada or is it also in the U.S.? And is that some of the gross margin pressure that you are thinking about in the second half as you have done a very nice job in terms of rate improvements in between categories over the last call it four, five quarters here?", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, I would say, this is Gregg, in the U.S. we continue to offer [hot] [ph] pricing. There isn\u2019t going to be a meaningful change in our strategy, because day-in and day-out we have unbeatable prices when you take a look at our - the fact that our prices are competitive, the price match policy both online and in-store and our REDcard\u2019s performance day-in and day-out we have a very strong value proposition and our circular pricing is even more aggressive than that and we take market leading positions. ", "In Canada, we know that we have an opportunity to break those shopping habits and we have got to focus on driving need-based trips. So, there in particular, we will sharpen up our pricing and make sure that we are taking a more of a market leader position. Our REDcard penetration is still very, very small there, and we expect that to grow over time, but it's more in Canada that we\u2019re going to make sure that our prices get more noticed than they have been upto this point. Part of that was a conscious plan on our part to make sure that we really won in home and apparel and we feel real good about where we\u2019re in those two businesses today, so we\u2019re proud of that fact. Now we have to just turn on the gas a little bit on the other side of the equation to make sure that we\u2019re getting the Canadian guest to understand what great values we offer on frequency categories and break some of those well-established habits.", "", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and then just real quick on the dilution in Canada obviously up quite a bit here in 2013 from the initial expectation, any way or ability to paint us a picture? I know you still remain constant in that five year outlook on the progression for that $0.80 in 2017. Thank you.", "", "John Mulligan", "I\u2019m not entirely clear where you\u2019re going, is that why are we confident about the $0.80 or what we will see happen here as we go forward, Sean?", "", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, so, I guess the question is, is there an ability to say that the Canadian business will be - you believe the Canadian business may be accretive in 2014.", "", "John Mulligan", "And so on 2014 I think very early here and we have given you our best view, I think when you step back we have been operating you know 60 some stores for on average about 2.5 months and so we\u2019re giving you our best information here for 2013 and clearly sales are a little bit short of where we so we need to work through some of the inventory and optimizing the business and optimizing our expense structure. I think as we look forward getting another 56 stores open, getting through a holiday will certainly provide a lot more information about where we expect to be but in 2014 I think we expect to see meaningful improvement in the profitability of Canada, we will cycle past all of the startup expenses, we will have our inventories more in line with sales patterns that we now have some information on.", "Our expense structure will be optimized to the sales level and we will start to grow sales, so I think we will see meaningful improvement in 2014 but I would say probably from this perspective today unlikely that we will see profitability on the full year and we will be back to provide a little more information on what that looks like and the cadence throughout the quarters again as we get a little bit more information this year get the stores open, get in new markets and get to a holiday season most importantly.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "I want to follow up on Canada and then touch on the U.S., just to make sure I got that right or maybe ask it in a different way John. If you look at the incremental Canadian dilution this year how much of it is related to those items of clearance, how much of it would be related to if you will startup cost or advertise and how much of it do you think is just a different margin structure in the business to drive that frequency in trips?", "", "John Mulligan", "Yeah I think parsing that all out is difficult, I would say the second one incremental marketing and advertising is not material to the total move from where we were to where we\u2019re today. I think the biggest driver of the change in profitability are dilution this year comes from we had a set of sales expectations, as we entered in the market and we also have given all the excitement that we saw building over two years we protected on the upside from an expense standpoint and from an inventory standpoint and the sales have been somewhat disappointing and so we need to work through those inventories, there are some clearance activity, there was some excess inventory this quarter as well that we worked through and we need to right size the entire expense structure for the sales numbers that we\u2019re currently operating and so I think that\u2019s the vast majority of it.", "I don\u2019t think we see I know we don\u2019t see going forward and a change in the overall, our view of what the margin rates were going to be; EBITDA, or EBIT rates were going to be in Canada over the long term. We feel very good about gross margin and frankly we expect gross margin will deteriorate a little bit as we begin to drive these frequency categories. You don\u2019t see that in this quarter\u2019s results because there was a fair bit of clearance and excess inventory that we moved through but we expect margin rates will come down as we grow sales in those frequency categories but net-net that will be good for the business and start to apply leverage against the fixed expenses that we have built for the business.", "", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "And then second, turning to the U.S., Kathryn was helpful to go through all the initiatives you have and it seems like the issue that is bigger than anything is traffic staying negative versus what you guys would have probably hoped or expected a year or two ago. If we think about the traffic side of it more specifically, what in the back half do you think is going to help stabilize and improve that traffic trend or is it just a way it is now that this trip consolidation and that\u2019s the way the consumer is. And if we are going to get comp it needs to be with more items in top line?", "", "Kathy Tesija", "You are right Gregg. Traffic was our issue. And I do think that somewhat that is the way it is right now. We are seeing a lot of trip consolidation across all guests. I think the part that I am pleased about is that when you look at our basket we are seeing that they are buying more units from Target as well as increase selling price and they are trading up into higher price point products. So, that\u2019s great. I think as we move forward the thing that we are focused on in driving traffic is really making sure that as they are consolidating and they are doing more in one store that we are offering that compelling value and Gregg talked a lot about all of those components, but that we make sure that, that continues to be rock solid as well as the innovative products. And I mentioned a lot of those that we have coming like Phillip and Haggar and in our seasonal categories, we have got a lot of new stuff coming. So, that\u2019s key.", "And then I guess the third thing that I would add is just making sure that our in-store experience remains outstanding, because we want them to be pleased when they come and continue to consolidate their trip and to do more at Target. So, we have great service every day, but in addition to that, some of the new things that we are doing with flexible fulfillment like buy online, pickup in store I think will be fantastic in the back half. And then we are also looking at really upping the in-store experience in key categories like beauty and the test that I described in baby. So, it\u2019s a combination of those three things.", "", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Thanks.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up on Canada and then a couple on U.S. business as well, could you just talk to the inventory overhang in Canada, the clearance that you spoke to, is that primarily also on frequency items or is that more a discretionary product?", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The inventory overhang is the function of the shortfall primarily in some of the seasonal categories. So, think of two - even though apparel and home was strong, the variability by store and the fact that some of our seasonal categories like lawn and patio didn\u2019t perform at the level that we were expecting. So, it was not in the basic categories or the non-discretionary, it\u2019s primarily in a subset of the discretionary categories, but it\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s more obvious, because of such a large number of stores, but it\u2019s the same kind of fine-tuning that we go through every time we open a new store here in the United States and have experienced for years and years. There is always a tremendous amount of fine-tuning and getting the right match of sales volatility, variability, assortment, and aligning that with inventory. What we are seeing in Canada is just there is such a big critical mass that it stands out and it\u2019s far more obvious, but it\u2019s not different than what we have experienced here.", "", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. And then in terms of the average transaction size, could you just elaborate on which categories are benefiting from the larger basket and the trade up that you alluded to?", "", "Kathy Tesija", "Yes, I think that we are seeing larger basket in many different areas they are shopping as I said doing more in one store shopping around the store. In terms of the selling price, we are seeing strength in trading up to higher price points in back-to-school. We are seeing strength, for example, in home with threshold, where they are buying that better product versus opening price point products. And then we are also seeing some softer sales in our one spot at the front of the store, which is very seasonal and impulsive product. So, that combination I think is driving that selling price.", "", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, if we look at some of the omni-channel and multi-channel initiatives that are launching in the back half, is there any way to quantify the potential impact or potentially in your survey work you could talk to how much demand there is for these products specifically on click and collect or buy online pickup and store, I know that\u2019s half of the volume in some cases for some of your competitors online businesses. Could you just talk to how big you think that could be for you in the back half? Thank you.", "Kathy Tesija", "We don\u2019t have a number that we can share on that, we have as you know we have been testing with team members and I think the key for us is just the convenience for guests to be able to buy it online but then they want to pick it up in-store, sometimes they don\u2019t want it delivered and sitting on their door step but often times they want to be able to get other things in the store either that go along with that core item or just the rest of their list. So we think it will be very interesting to our guest, it certainly has been with our team members but we haven\u2019t quantified the sales number yet.", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yeah I would just say you know this is we\u2019re in a learning environment right now, we will be able to give you a lot more specifics that to just to the holiday season and first try and quantify at this stage would be it would be a (inaudible) so we really don\u2019t want to speculate how our guests are going to use that and but we will be back at the end of the holiday and we will give you a lot more color around the adoption, the acceptance rates by our guest.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup", "Speaking about the spending in those first half of the year versus the back half of the year on marketing and why is it a competitive environment, can you just help us think about how that spending might take place in the back half versus the first half of the year?", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "There is not really a meaningful difference in terms of rate of spend, first half, second half. We didn\u2019t overspend or underspend the first half to shift dollars to the second half. We have always felt that the allocation of resources by quarter by half has been pretty appropriate and our spend is going to be similar in those kinds of percentages, what we have seen is we have ramped up our spend in the digital channel, it's a less expensive channel that gives us a different guest and broader reach and we have become far more efficient in the use of our marketing dollar so I think we\u2019re getting the same or more bang for our buck for essentially the same investments that we have made in the past.", "", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay and then with regard to Canada can you elaborate a little bit on the announcement this week with regards to the Metro partnership in Canada?", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yeah we\u2019re excited to have Metro as partner to run our pharmacies in the Quebecian province in the Eastern part of the Canada, we think they are a great partner and they run a terrific business and we\u2019re thrilled to have them as our partner.", "", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay and then lastly it seems like you have unique opportunity with the red carpet to Europe communications between Canada and U.S. is almost 20% of our fashion base, can you talk about through email and text what you\u2019re doing in terms of virtualization?", "", "Kathy Tesija", "We\u2019re doing a lot with both email and text but I would tell you Deb we\u2019re on the beginning of that journey, we think there is a lot more that we can do but we\u2019re doing you know things with personalization in terms of seasonal and timing but also product categories that resonate with our guests and we\u2019re seeing great results. We\u2019ve upped particularly email a lot this year and it's really paying off and so you know we\u2019re on a journey and we think that there is a lot of headroom there and we will go after that in a big way.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.", "", "Jason DeRise \u2013 UBS", "I wanted to ask about Canada\u2019s gross margin again I know there has been a few questions already but if you did better on the more of those discretionary items and I guess there were some shortfalls store by store in terms of certain seasonal items coming through I mean is this, how is this I guess effecting maybe some of your plans, are you adding more planograms, is that going to add some of the SG&A cost to service all these stores if it's just different demand for different products and just reflecting how that growth in Canada actually it's just weather effects and what have you learned from that process?", "", "Kathy Tesija", "I don\u2019t think that we will be adding a lot of planograms version but I think we\u2019re still tweaking on those planograms but we understand that and we have got many different versions throughout Canada for all of their differences across geography and their guests but I think what Gregg was talking about was number one getting the buy right buy store in all of those categories and then some of the seasonal categories were softer, so making sure that we get that buy rate going forward that has less to do with the planogram itself. And then in addition to that as we are driving more trips with our frequency category that\u2019s beside that\u2019s been weaker, we think that traffic will also help sales throughout the store as the guests clearly like their differentiated merchandise on the apparel and home side. So, it\u2019s kind of a combination, but it\u2019s more about the buy than it is about planogram.", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "The other thing I would add Jason is, if you step back to where we were three months ago, the gross margin rate was little a bit above 38%. And the two things we said at that time I think are still appropriate. One it\u2019s going to noisy here early by quarter, because it\u2019s just naturally that way as we are opening up stores, but two, don\u2019t expect us to operate at that higher level. While the mix was very favorable, we hadn\u2019t gone through any seasonal clearance, and so seasonal clearance is going to naturally bring that rate down. This quarter a little bit more than we would have expected, but there again I said we are working through some excess inventory given our sale levels. So, we expect through time that the gross margin rate will normalize at a reasonable level that ultimately will allow us to deliver EBITDA margin rates, let\u2019s say, 12% in Canada like we have talked about all along.", "", "Jason DeRise - UBS", "Okay. And then I guess I wanted to ask on the U.S. side about the efforts to increase service of omni-channel, flexible fulfillment, and all those things, obviously that cost a lot to implement than the way I said and you can correct me if I am wrong very centralized already. So, should we think about this is just necessary to keep sales growing and maybe it comes in at a lower margin or are there areas that you can offset that impact?", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "I would think at it as this way. In our business at any given point in time, there are investments that we have to make to continue to get better at what we do whether it\u2019s a service or supply chain or technology investments or investments in the guest experience. And so this is \u2013 I mean we are calling attention to this, but these are investments that we are going to make in the business, because we want to provide a great experience, which means our expense optimization efforts as they have in the past have to more than offset these kinds of investments. So, we look at it all-in holistically, and we are saying hey, we got to get leaner and leaner in certain parts of the organization and become more efficient. And we demonstrated that last quarter, we were very, very rock solid in our expense, in our productivity and that affords us the ability to \u2013 and the capacity to get more aggressive and do some of these kinds of things and invest in transforming the business to the future.", "", "Jason DeRise - UBS", "And I guess could you may be elaborate on that? I know that you talked a bit about that there is the compensation accrual in that, that helps then you also mentioned that you were better on payrolls. I mean, is that something where you think there is more room to go in terms of the in-store labor, or is that something where you really wouldn\u2019t want to push too hard on because of the potential implications on revenue, and if that\u2019s the case where else could the savings be if it\u2019s not the store?", "", "John Mulligan", "Jason, we said at the beginning of the year of the investments in multi-channel and everything we were doing would be $0.20 to $0.25 of incremental dilution or incremental expense in our business. And we said at that time that through our expense optimization efforts, we expected to offset virtually all of that in the year. We do that in a variety of ways. The stores have continuously over a long period of years look for ways to increase productivity faster than wage rate and faster than sales to lowering our expense rate. And we think there is opportunities to continue to apply technology to improve productivity in our stores. So, what Gregg was talking about our expense optimization efforts are across the entire organization, headquarters, distribution, supply chain, everywhere we operate, we are looking for ways to take expense out, so that we can afford to invest in the business.", "", "Jason DeRise - UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Great.

Please go ahead.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, I will provide a high level summary of our fourth quarter results and strategic priorities for the year ahead, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights, and the holiday season. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our financial outlook for 2014.

Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in the 8-K we filed this morning.", "Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "Target\u2019s fourth quarter financial results reflect better than expected U.S segments performance in the first three weeks of the holiday season, followed by meaningfully softer results, following our December 19th announcement that criminals had gained access to guest payment card data in our U.S stores.", "In total, fourth quarter comparable sales decreased 2.5% consistent with our updated guidance in January. Throughout the quarter our team managed the business extremely well, adjusting both inventory and expenses to match the rapidly changing pace of sales. As a result, our US operations generated fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 at the high-end of the updated guidance we provided in January.", "In Canada, we worked diligently to leverage holiday traffic in an effort to clear excess inventory. Markdowns resulting from this effort drove a very low gross margin rate, but allowed us to reduce average inventory per store in Canada by approximately 30% between the beginning and end of the fourth quarter.", "Canadian segment EPS dilution was $0.40 in the quarter, $0.05 better than the updated guidance we provided in January. We are pleased that our early cycle Canadian stores have seen the most improvement giving us confidence that we will continue to see continued improvement across all our Canadian stores in 2014.", "Fourth quarter GAAP EPS of $0.81 reflects U.S and Canadian segment performance along with costs related to our recent restructuring in data breach along with small accounting and tax matters. As we work to address the impact of the mid-December data breach, we have put the welfare of our guests at the center of every decision we\u2019ve made.", "We have communicated in early and often providing the best information we had about new facts in ongoing -- on the ongoing investigation. We consistently assured our guests that they would have zero liability for any unauthorized charges on their card accounts resulting from the breach.", "We increased fraud detection for REDcard holders and extended free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for any guests who has ever shopped one of our U.S stores. We are truly sorry for the impact this breach has had on our guests, team members and other stakeholders and I want to reiterate that we are committed for making things right.", "We know these initial steps are part of a longer process. We continue to listen to our guests and we know that this incident and recent security breaches at other companies have shaken their confidence in both Target and the U.S payment system more broadly.", "To rebuild guest confidence, we\u2019re committed to an end-to-end review in cooperation with third-party experts to understand how the breach occurred, the identification and acceleration of solutions to provide enhanced protection in the future and engagement with third-party experts to protect the industry and consumers from future threats.", "Accordingly, we're taking the following steps. We are conducting an end-to-end forensic investigation of our processes, systems and personnel to make informed decisions on potential security enhancements. We are accelerating the adoption of advanced chip enabled technology, investing more than $100 million to equip our stores and to issue Target branded smart chip credit and debit cards.", "We have long supported this more secured technology; a broad adoption in the U.S market has been elusive. We believe that recent events will help the industry to reach a tipping point to an accelerated option in the U.S and we are investing to ensure that Target is a clear leader in driving this change.", "We are working collaboratively with a broad set of stakeholders in the payment card space including banks, retailers, trade associations, payment processors and networks to share in advance best practices and foster future innovation.", "We helped launch and will be an active leader in retail industry, cyber security and data privacy initiative. In addition, we are investing $5 million in a new coalition with the Better Business Bureau and National Cyber Security Alliance and the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance to advance public education around cyber security and the dangers of consumer scams.", "While we can't yet assess the full impact of this crime against Target and our guests, we\u2019re pleased that sales have started to recover from the trends we observed following breach related announcements in December and January. Importantly, because we\u2019re in a strong financial position, we expect to absorb any near-term financial impacts while continuing to invest in projects that are key to our long-term success.", "Our Company has a long history of innovation, disciplined management, and a strong long-term financial performance and we are committed to upholding the principles which has -- have sustained this Company success for many decades. And while 2013 was a disappointing year financially, we have entered the New Year with the right plans in place to grow profitably and generate meaningfully improved financial performance in 2014 and beyond.", "In the U.S., we have demonstrated our ability to manage the business with discipline and generate strong financial performance even in a challenging environment. In fact, Kathy will outline in more detail we were very pleased with our holiday season results prior to the announcement of the data breach.", "In preparation for fourth quarter, we may change this to our holiday promotion and marketing and we were pleased that our in stocks were running at all-time highs. As a result, U.S segment fourth quarter sales were running ahead of plan prior to December 19th.", "Looking ahead, we will apply the insights we gained in the holiday season to connect with our guests at delivering merchandize and promotions thoughtfully designed to appeal to them based on what's on their mind at each point in the year, moving Target beyond compelling, to becoming irresistible for our guests.", "We made enormous progress in our multichannel efforts throughout 2013 as we meaningfully increased conversion both on our website and on our mobile apps. We acquired Chef's Catalog, Cooking.com and Dermstore, extending our online assortment by providing our guests access to additional high-end brands in key home and beauty categories.", "We launched Cartwheel, our unique mobile savings tool which has far exceeded expectations in both adoption and engagement and we accelerated our investments in flexible fulfillment. As a result, throughout the year, growth in our digital traffic and sales outpaced industry averages. We launched in-store pick up chain-wide at the beginning of November and with very little marketing, this new offering became a meaningful driver of digital traffic and sales.", "Our store teams did an outstanding job delivering great service when guests arrived to pick up these orders and this is particularly impressive since we launched the service during the busiest time of the year. We will continue to invest in systems, data and processes to enhance our flexible fulfillment capabilities in 2014 and beyond.", "In our stores we are committed to enhancing the guest experience by adding dedicated service to key categories like beauty, baby and electronics and by providing training and technology that allows our stores team to go beyond providing basic service to solving problems for our guests. And we're continuing to pilot innovations to our store formats.", "Based on the initial rollout of the CityTarget format and the high single digit comparable sales we're seeing in our second year CityTarget stores, we're analyzing opportunities to redeem the size and enhance the flexibility of this format opening up a wider universe of potential sites in dense urban areas.", "While on the work on CityTarget continues, we've also developed a separate smaller format called Target Express at about 15% of the size of one of our general merchandize stores, we believe this design provides us with a fantastic opportunity to expand into new trade areas providing a convenient solution to guests who can easily visit one of our other formats.", "While we expect to offer a carefully curated assortment in frequency categories like food, health care, beauty and other household essentials, Target Express will also offer discretionary categories including home, electronics and seasonal. Throughout the store we will feature our own brands which offer guests an unbeatable combination of quality and price. We plan to open our first pilot location of this format here in our home market in July so we can carefully study both operational and financial results before we determine our plans to expand this format to other markets.", "Throughout the organization we continue to find new opportunities to optimize expenses, freeing up resources we can apply to new initiatives. In 2013 our teams saved approximately $200 million by reprioritizing their activities and finding more efficient ways to get things done. Our expense optimization efforts are not a short-term project but a complete overall of the way we work and the team continues to find new opportunities. As a result, we expect the benefit of our expense optimization efforts to reach $1 billion in annualized savings by 2015. I'm proud that our entire team has embraced this effort to transform how we work.", "In Canada the team has moved from a year focused on opening a record number of stores to optimizing the business in run state. As we enter 2014 with a much cleaner inventory position, the team's number one operational focus is on in-stocks, ensuring we have the right quantity of each item in the right place at the right time. In addition, we continue to invest in technology and training to enhance both the tools our team uses and their ability to deploy them most effectively.", "We're also continuing to implement innovative marketing and merchandizing programs in Canada to raise awareness for our frequency categories like grocery, household essentials, beauty and healthcare. Throughout 2014 we will focus on conveying the depth and breadth of our assortment in those categories and the unbeatable value we provide to our everyday pricing, 5% of the awards, price match and our flier. With enhanced guest awareness of our unbeatable prices combined with the benefit of improved operations, we expect guest shopping frequency to build throughout 2014, driving improvement in sales and profitability.", "While 2013 will clearly be remembered as the challenging year, I am proud of team's efforts to transform our business and position the company for long-term success. And I want to sincerely thank the Target team for their tireless effort to help our guests recover from the data breach. While there is much more work to be done, I'm inspired by their singular focus on our guests and making things right. As a result, I'm confident we will look back on this incident and see that we emerged from it even stronger than before.", "Now Kathy will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results and key initiatives as we enter 2014. Kathy?", "Kathy Tesija", "Thanks, Gregg. In our last conference call, we outlined our plans for the holiday season and mentioned that fourth quarter sales were on track through the first half of November. As we progressed through Black Friday week and the first two weeks of December, guests continued to respond to our promotions and sales ran ahead of our plan.", "Following the data breach announcement and the rapid change in the pace of our sales, the team reacted quickly making nimble adjustments to minimize our excess inventory. This quick response allowed us to end the year with a clean inventory position. And while our fourth quarter gross margin reflected the addition of clearance activity resulting from the sales slowdown, our team did a great job minimizing the impact.", "As we built our holiday plans, our goal was to cut through the clutter and reach our guests with compelling offers on exciting merchandize, specifically we aligned our weekly deals and events so guests were receiving a clear message across all channels. And because our guests are budget conscious and love to find deals, we intentionally layered promotions across our circular, cartwheel and our catalog to provide unbeatable value. We used our direct channels to drive urgency at key points of the season and we offered more broad attention-getting promotions like 40% off sweaters.", "Consistent with past years, we featured hot deals on key items but attracted more attention by offering deeper discounts on fewer items and we were very pleased with the guest response. For the quarter overall, our non-discretionary categories generally saw the strongest sales performance. However, on our more discretionary categories electronics saw an increase in fourth quarter comparable sales led by mobile phones, tablets and video game hardware and software. We also saw relative strength in our sporting goods and housewares categories.", "Digital channels had a very strong holiday season. Thanksgiving was our biggest digital sales day ever with mobile devices accounting for a full 25% of those sales. We were recently recognized as having the most browsed app by a smartphone and tablet in 2013 and Mobile Commerce Daily just named Target Mobile Retailer and Commerce Website of the Year. This is the second time we've been named Mobile Retailer of the Year and we're pleased to be the only retailer to be honored with the award twice.", "An important factor in our digital success was the fourth quarter rollout of the opportunity to buy online and pick up in-store. In-store pick up requests represented about 10% of fourth quarter digital orders but they peaked at a much higher rate before Christmas as guests relied on the service as a great solution for last-minute gift shopping. About 30% of store visits to pick up an online order resulted in store shopping on that same trip and the size of that store transaction was much larger than an average store trip.", "While we've rolled out the capabilities with an external commitment to have orders ready in four hours or less, our team quickly attained our internal goal to have most orders ready in one hour or better. Our survey showed consistently high levels of guest satisfaction with this service and this capability has accelerated our mobile conversion rates.", "We're also pleased with the continued growth of Cartwheel, our digital savings app, which ended 2013 with over 5 million users who have already saved more than $43 million. Younger guests are particularly engaged by Cartwheel as more than half of its users are Millennials, a much higher percentage than they represent in our overall guest base.", "Redemption rates on Cartwheel are more than 10 times higher than DC and other direct channels like receipt marketing and email and our analysis indicate that its driving incremental trips and sales. Our pre-Black Friday deals resulted in one of the biggest days ever for Cartwheel as they drove one-third of our active users into Target stores on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.", "We continue to work to enhance the Cartwheel experience. We recently added the ability to scan bar codes to find out if there's a Cartwheel deal on an item and added the capability to signup for Cartwheel directly through a Target account and email while continuing to provide access to the App through Facebook.", "As Gregg mentioned, we continue to listen to our guests to understand how we can help them move beyond the data breach and feel confident in shopping at Target. While sales have started to recover in recent weeks and sentiment metrics have begun to improve most notably among our best guests. We continue to invest to ensure this recovery continues. Beyond our efforts in data security and chip enabled technology we're applying insights from the holiday season to make our merchandise stores and digital channels even more irresistible to our guests.", "We continue to innovate in ways that differentiate both our product assortments and the guest experience, and we\u2019re investing in pricing and promotions to make our value proposition even stronger. We\u2019re very pleased with the response to Peter Pilotto for Target our most recent designer partnership which launched earlier this month. This collection which features a limited edition assortment of women\u2019s apparel, accessories and swimwear is available at most of our U.S. and Canadian stores and on target.com. We have also partnered with Net-a-Porter.com to offer a curated assortment of the collection to fans across the globe. With lots of social media buzz we a saw long lines outside many of our urban stores on the morning of the launch, and the collection quickly became Net-a-Porter\u2019s fastest selling collaboration in history.", "Based on last years results Target and Sports Illustrated are once again partnering in support of the magazines annual swimsuit issue which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Target is the exclusive mass retail advertiser and official marketing partner for the issue. This years partnership includes the new 20 page flip cover that celebrates swimsuit style over the past 50 years and features Target\u2019s limited edition swimwear collection. The collection launched at Target stores and on target.com February 17, in advance of the issues on stand date and includes 10 black, gold and ivory swimsuits priced from $15 to $30.", "Earlier this month, Target began offering AMBAR a new apparel collection designed with the Latina guest in mind. AMBAR is set in 50 U.S. stores this month and is also available on target.com. The line of apparel and accessories features vibrant prints and flattering cuts and silhouettes. This stylish and affordable collection has items ranging from $17 to $40. This spring Target will introduce an assortment of premium skincare featuring seven notable brands, four of which will be exclusively sold at Target. 29 by Lydia Mondavi, Borghese, Laneige and MD Complete by Dr. Zelickson along side industry favorite Vichy, La Roche Posay and Own Skin Health. These brands will be merchandised in two distinct sections, dermatological skincare and specialty skincare, and they have already launched on target.com. We\u2019ll begin rolling out the assortment to 749 U.S. Target stores beginning in March.", "So what's likely to be the biggest Blu-ray and DVD release of the year Target will offer an exclusive addition of Catching Fire the second film in The Hunger Games trilogy in stores and on target.com next month. The Target exclusive Blu-ray addition includes 45 minutes of exclusive content from never before seen footage and cast interviews to a behind the scenes looks at the making of the film. This spring award winning singer Shakira is teaming up with Target for her 10th studio album and our exclusive deluxe edition featuring three bonus tracks hit stores on March 25. We announced the partnership and kicked off album preordering with a special spot during the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January.", "Last month we became the exclusive retailer to feature Beats music playlists. Beats music is curated digital music streaming services that allows it's users to peep into the personal music libraries of their favorite artists and brands and have them create playlists just for them. By subscribing to Target\u2019s playlist guest can expect a very mix of songs inspired by Target\u2019s rich heritage of music and the taste of the millions who shop for albums at Target each year. In December we launched The Awesome Shop, a beta site that features the top target products recently pinned on Pinterest. The site lets guests explore, get inspired and see what other guests love just like they do in stores.", "Awesome Shop highlighted the best of the best by only featuring items at the target.com review of four stars or better. We\u2019re also leveraging Pinterest in another unique way to collaborate with three of the sites most influential pinners on a series of party planning collections that will make it easy to throw a Pinterest worthy event. Joy Cho of Oh Joy, Jan Halvarson of Poppytalk and Kate Arends of Wit & Delight will each create limited time only collections launched over the course of 2014 including party d\u00e9cor, paper products and serving pieces designed in their signature esthetic.", "Beyond differentiated merchandise, we continue to provide enhanced service in key areas of the store. Based on guest response to last years launch we have expanded the Target Beauty Concierge\u2019s program to more than 300 stores across the country with new markets including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth. These beauty consultants are brand agnostic and provide guests with detailed, unbiased information and a friendly face in what can often be an intermediating category.", "We also continue to see great results from the pilot of our new baby layout, a completely redesigned shopping experience that offers guests inspiring insightful solutions combined with the great value they\u2019ve come to expect from Target. This new layout features a dedicated service desk with a knowledgeable baby advisor to help guests navigate the area and provide unbiased product information. Digital screens and iPads feature inspiration and interactive comparison tools and BabyCenter content such as buying guides and product reviews ", "We have also incorporated an in department registry kiosk for expecting mom\u2019s or guests looking to give a gift. Merchandised displays have been lowered so guests can more easily interact with large products by travel systems in stores. We have removed barriers to enhance navigation between apparel, gear and baby essentials and we have highlighted the availability of additional online only items in key categories. This summer we plan to grow from 30 stores to more than 200 locations featuring this enhanced baby experience. And based on encouraging initial results in 2014 we\u2019ll expand our test of using mannequins in apparel in our largest format U.S. stores to elevate the store experience, create an enhanced sense of discovery and bring our unique deigns to life.", "We also continued to augment our digital capabilities driving traffic and sales to all of our channels. Online our top priority in 2014 is continuing to improve the guest experience. All of our efforts will be designed to make things simple, seamless and enjoyable for our guests. To support this priority we continue to hire external talent with deep functional expertise in online merchandising, site merchandising, mobile and analytics. We have recently made enhancements focused on search, product information and checkout making it easier for guests to browse and purchase. In addition now nearly all store products are viable online making this the only place that guests can use Target\u2019s full assortment. Importantly we\u2019re making enhancements while continuing to focus on stability and speed, as a result target.com consistently ranks in the top 10 for retailer site availability and performance.", "Given the profile of our guests, mobile is more important at Target than for many of our peers. For example, Target\u2019s guest traffic from tablets and mobile phones is greater than our traffic from traditional computers and the shift towards mobile shows no signs of slowing down. In fact usage of the Target App doubled in the short period between last summer and the end of the year. To maintain our strong momentum in mobile we\u2019re testing and learning from new features including List Building, Mapping and Cartwheel capabilities launched during the holiday season. We\u2019re improving conversion by streamlining checkouts and enhancing product information and dynamic content and we are investing to amplify the in-store mobile experience by rolling out guided maps, in-store search and expanded assortment chain wide later this year.", "We also continue to invest in our flexible fulfillment capabilities which combine the strengths of our digital, store and distribution aspects to provide speed and convenience for our guests. These capabilities allow our stores to add value in new ways, serve our guests as both showroom and fulfillment centers. Following the holiday seasons success of in-store pick up we are moving quickly to roll out the capabilities to shift online orders from our stores this fall.", "This new capability will create multiple benefits for both Target as our guests, including shorter shipping times, reduced expenses, lower markdown rates and improved in-stocks. And because our investments in flexible fulfillment drive greater utilization of our existing stores and distribution center assets, we expect to earn an outstanding return on these investments over time.", "Finally, we're pleased with initial performance of Target Ticket, our streaming video service and we continue to invest in features to better serve guest changing needs and behaviors both inside and outside their home. In 2014 we will coordinate our promotions across channels to provide irresistible video offers across our stores, Target.com and Target Ticket.", "While our fourth quarter results softened following the December 19 announcement of the data breach, we are pleased with the guest response to our holiday season merchandizing and marketing efforts and we're confident in our plans for 2014. As always our focus remains on our guests helping them regain their confidence in their Target while delivering irresistible content and experiences in every channel. We believe that our efforts will drive a continued recovery in the pace of our sales and position Target for profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.", "Now, John will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our plans for the coming year. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, Kathy. Our fourth quarter financial results reflect strong efforts by our team to handle separate challenges in both our U.S. and Canadian segments. In the U.S. comparable sales declined 2.5% consistent with the updated guidance we provided in our January press release. This sales performance reflects a 5.5% decline in transactions partially offset by an increase in average ticket.", "Prior to the announcement of the data breach, fourth quarter comparable sales were running positive reflecting the success of our holiday merchandizing marketing plan. Immediately following news of the breach, sales turned meaningfully negative but began to recover in January. And while it's impossible to measure precisely, we believe we would have seen even more improvement had there not been extreme weather across much of the country.", "Fourth quarter sales penetration on our REDcards was 20.9%, up 5.4 percentage points from a year ago. While the rate of increase slowed down following the breach, year-over-year penetration continued to grow hundreds of basis points through the end of the quarter. Fourth quarter U.S. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were down more than a percentage point from last year's rates, which we were advised to reflect combined results from our former U.S. retail and credit card segments. These profit margins were below our expectations going into the quarter, driven almost entirely by gross margin rate which declined about 20 basis points from the year ago.", "This performance reflects about 20 basis points of benefit from this year's change in vendor payments offset by higher than expected markdowns related to the 10% off we offered prior to Christmas as well as the impact of clearance markdowns at the end of the holiday season. Margin mix was somewhat less favorable than the recent quarters, driven by strong sales in electronics. While below our expectations, fourth quarter U.S. segment gross margin rate was remarkably strong considering the team had to rapidly manage excess inventory in the middle of the quarter when we experienced a sudden change in the pace of sales following the data breach announcement.", "Our fourth quarter U.S. segment SG&A rate was 18.4%, about 110 basis points above last year's revised rate. About 50 basis points of this headwind was related to the credit card portfolio reflecting a smaller asset base, last year's reserve release and this year's profit sharing arrangement with TD Bank. Another 20 basis points of headwind was driven by this year's change in member payments. The remaining unfavorability reflects the deleveraging effort of negative comp sales.", "The fact that we experienced only 40 basis points of deleverage reflects strong control of variable expenses, given the magnitude of our comparable sales decline. In the Canadian segment, sales came in just below expectations. Importantly, as Gregg mentioned, we took advantage of holiday traffic to clear through a significant amount of excess inventory in the quarter. And while we expect some small lingering issues with long lean receipts this year, the Canadian segment ended 2013 in a much cleaner inventory position, paving the way for smoother operations in 2014. In all, the segment drove $0.40 of EPS dilution in the fourth quarter better than the expectations we provided in our January press release.", "Turning now to our consolidated metrics, fourth quarter interest expense was 21% lower than last year reflecting the continued benefit of debt retirement funded by the proceeds from the sale of the credit card portfolio. We paid dividends of $0.43 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 19% from fourth quarter 2012. This was our 185th consecutive quarter in which our company has paid a dividend and 2013 marked the 42nd year of annual dividend increases, a track record of few companies to match.", "Consistent with last quarter, we didn't purchase any shares in the fourth quarter reflecting current performance and our desire to maintain our debt rating in the middle A range. This approach aligns with our longstanding point of view on capital deployment. First, we invest what we believe is appropriate in our core business. Second, we support the dividend which we've grown annually for more than four decades. And third, we use share repurchase to return cash within the limits of our middle A debt rating.", "We believe a middle A rating is strategically important as it supports our ability to reliably deliver on our unbeatable pricing strategy over time. In addition, our balance sheet provides the flexibility to maintain our long-term focus in the face of unexpected events like the data breach enabling investment and strategic initiatives like flexible fulfillment while we deal with a temporary setback in traffic to sales along with other costs related to the breach.", "In addition to operating results in the U.S. and Canada, our fourth quarter GAAP earnings reflects several items that reduced EPS by approximately $0.09. These items include charges related to our January restructuring, data breach related costs net of an insurance receivable and continued reduction in a beneficial interest asset partially offset by a small benefit from a resolution of income tax matters.", "Combining fourth quarter results with performance in the first nine months of 2013 yields full year results that reflect the impact of clear successes and certain challenges. In our U.S. segment, full year comparable sales declined 0.4% well below our expectations going into the year. This reflects the tougher than expected consumer environment including the impact on the payroll tax increase which just annualized last month, the fourth quarter impact of the data breach and recent headwinds from unfavorable weather, as you've heard from many other retailers.", "On our U.S. sales, we earned a gross margin rate of 29.8% in 2013, up about 10 basis points from 2012. This rate reflects about 20 basis points of benefit from this year's change in vendor payments combined with very strong underlying margin performance in the face of softer than expected sales. Throughout the year, Kathy's team did a great job managing inventory resulting in outstanding in-stock levels while avoiding unnecessary clearance markdowns.", "Our full year SG&A expense rate in the U.S. was 20%, up about 90 basis points from last year's revised rate. Contrary to what you might initially think, this reflects outstanding performance in light of softer than expected sales and some notable challenges representing more than $600 million of incremental pressure. Including credit card portfolio income, which as you know reduces our SG&A rate, about $400 million lower than 2012 reflecting profit sharing with TD, prior year reserve reductions and a smaller asset base this year. And more than $200 million of expense pressure from incremental investments in technology and supply chain to support our multichannel efforts.", "Without these impacts, our SG&A expense rate would have been slightly higher than 2012 but would have been neutral without this year's change in vendor payments. This is better expense performance than we'd expect on a decline in comparable sales and was driven primarily by two factors; outstanding performance by our stores organization which continued to provide outstanding guest service while delivering productivity increases and our company-wide expense optimization efforts through which our teams are finding better ways to work while deprioritizing less productive activities.", "As Gregg mentioned, the team continues to find new opportunities to optimize expenses and we expect to reach $1 billion in annualized savings by 2015 helping to fund our efforts to drive profitable growth over the next several years. For full year 2013, U.S. REDcard penetration grew nearly 6 percentage points to 19.3% of sales as more and more guests increased their level of engagement and their spending with Target. Penetration in Kansas City where we began offering REDcard awards a year ahead of the rest of the country continued to run well ahead of the U.S. overall.", "Importantly, as part of our broader effort to rebuild traffic and sales in 2014 we will work to reaccelerate REDcard growth in light of the recent slowdown in growth we've seen following the data breach. In Canada in 2013 we generated just over $1.3 billion in sales on 124 stores which were opened on average for a little more than half the year. These sales were well below our plan going into the year leading to greater than expected markdowns on a meaningful amount of excess inventory ", "Expense rate were unusually high as well as a result of opening early cycle stores with too many payroll hours, incurring incremental expense relating to clearing inventory and experiencing less leverage on fixed expenses.", "In the face of these challenges, the team worked tirelessly to improve operations and work through excess inventory throughout the year, clearing the way for an acceleration of sales and profitability beginning this year.", "Our early cycle store continued to outperform later cycle stores giving is confidence that our operations will continue to become more efficient as our business matures. And having dramatically reduced the congestion in our Canadian supply chain, we will increase the intensity of our marketing message in 2014 regarding value and assortment in our frequency categories. Over time we expect this will lead our Canadian guests to choose Target more often in these categories, driving meaningful increases in traffic and sales.", "Turning to capital deployment, our total capital investment was about $3.5 billion in 2013, somewhat lower than expected as U.S CapEx of about $1.9 billion was approximately $300 million lower than anticipated. This outcome doesn't reflect a change in strategy, but is simply the result of a lower than expected cost for certain projects and retiming of suspending into 2014.", "Having sold our credit card portfolio, for about $5.7 billion in March, we significantly reduced our net debt position in 2013, including the early retirement of Haikupon debt. And importantly even in a year of peak CapEx and dilution relating to the Canadian segment combined with the impact of softer than expected U.S sales, we still have the capacity to return about $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.", "With that as context, let's turn now to our outlook for 2014. But before we get to the numbers, I want to discuss a change in our reporting and guidance practices in 2014. Given that our Canadian segment is now fully operating, beginning with the first quarter of 2014 we will no longer exclude Canadian segment performance from adjusted EPS. To allow for appropriate comparison, last year's adjusted EPS will also reflect Canadian segment performance as well.", "With that, let's turn to our full-year outlook beginning with sales. While trends have improved in recent weeks, severe winter weather has been a headwind and we continue to see the impact of the data breach on guest sentiment and traffic. We believe that we will continue to see muted trends in the next few months, but the breach impact will diminish throughout the year as we engage in a vigorous effort to address our guests\u2019 concerns and provide irresistible content offers driving business to our stores and digital channels.", "In addition, while economic trends are improving, we continue to expect our lower and middle income guests to shop very cautiously in 2014. With that backdrop, our current view is that U.S comparable sales will grow in the range of 0% to 2% in 2014. On those sales we expect a U.S segment EBITDA rate of 10.1% to 10.3%, meaning EBITDA dollar should grow between 5% and 8% this year.", "Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect gross margin will improve 30 or 40 basis points from our 2013 rate of 29.8%, reflecting improved clearance markdown rates and more significantly the gross margin benefit of our expense optimization efforts. These benefits will be partially offset by the impact of additional promotional activities and continued investment in 5% REDcard rewards.", "We expect the U.S segment SG&A expense rate slightly better than last year\u2019s 20% rate, reflecting continued discipline expense control and the benefit of our expense optimization efforts offset by our continued investments in distribution and technology in support of our multi-channel efforts. We expect these (indiscernible) investments to be worth $0.05 to $0.10 of incremental EPS pressure in 2014.", "In Canada, we expect total sales will be approximately double our 2013 experience. As we annualize last year\u2019s124 openings and begin generating comparable sales growth in mature stores. On those sales we expect to earn a much higher gross margin rate in a range approaching 30%. But clearly we continue to see some near-term volatility until the Until the Canadian business matures.", "While we expect to see better fixed expense leverage in 2014, the SG&A rate will likely remain well above our long-term outlook in a range approaching 40%. Altogether, this will lead to a Canadian segment EBITDA margin rate of minus 8% to minus 10%, representing more than $400 million of expected EBITDA improvement from 2013.", "We expect U.S capital expenditures of $2.1 billion -- $2.3 billion, up slightly from actual 2013 spending. The mix of U.S CapEx will continue to tilt from investments in new stores towards supply chain and technology as we accelerate our multi-channel efforts and continue to find a limited number of new store sites that meet our strategic and financial criteria.", "I should also note that U.S CapEx reflects incremental investments related to our recent decision to accelerate deployment of chip enabled card readers to all of our U.S stores before the end of the year. In Canada we expect 2014 capital expenditures in the $300 million to $400 million range, down more than $1 billion from peak spending in 2013.", "We expect once again to raise our annual dividend in the neighborhood of 20% this year, which will mark our 43rd consecutive annual increase. And even with a temperate outlook for near-term traffic and sales and understanding there will be further costs relating to the data breach, our current outlook envision share repurchase capacity of $1 billion to $2 billion in 2014, beginning later in the year as our business stabilizes and we have more clarity on potential breach related costs.", "Altogether, these expectations would lead to full-year adjusted EPS representing results from operations in the U.S and Canada of $3.85 to $4.15. This estimate excludes approximately $0.07 of dilution related to the continued reduction in the beneficial interest asset. These 2014 expectations represent an improvement of more than 20% from combined U.S and Canadian segment results in 2013.", "Please note that our full-year outlook does not include potential additional costs relating to the data breach beyond what we already recorded in the fourth quarter, as they\u2019re not estimable at this time. While I realize this may result in a wide range of speculation on the magnitude of these costs, given that our investigation of breach is ongoing it would not be appropriate to say anything more about it than we already have this morning.", "Regardless of the ultimate dollar amounts, as Greg mentioned, we have the financial strength to move beyond these near-term impacts while we continue to invest in the future. And as always, we are focused on what's most important, addressing the concerns of our guests and helping them to feel confident shopping with us.", "Now let's briefly turn to our first quarter outlook. In the U.S we expect first quarter comparable sales in the range of flat to down 2%. So far in February comparable sales have been running within that range, ahead of our forecast and nearly flat to last year. And I should note while growth isn\u2019t running where it had been earlier in 2013, REDcard penetration so far in February has been running 100s of basis points ahead of last year.", "On our first quarter U.S sales, we expect an EBITDA margin rate of 9.7% to 9.9%. In Canada, we expect to generate first quarter sales in a range of $400 million to $450 million with EBITDA of minus $150 million to minus $170 million.", "In light of this near-term operating outlook, we don't expect to have the capacity to repurchase shares in the first quarter, but we expect to resume this activity later in the year. Altogether, our expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS reflecting operating results in the U.S and Canada in the range of $0.60 to $0.75, excluding $0.02 relating to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential costs related to the data breach.", "While this has been a challenging year, we are proud of the work of our team and we believe we have the right plans in place to generate meaningfully improved performance in 2014. As we focus on making Target irresistible for our guests, both today and over time, we believe we will go profitably for many years to come.", "With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Greg, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. On the same-store sales trends for February being down in that 0% to 2% range, probably little bit better than people expected. I guess you over time, Target has been on an aggressive campaign to drive frequency with REDcard and remodeling more stores towards food, but given that P Fresh is maturing here and the credit breach could curb some of the willingness to sign up for REDcard and online taking a bigger portion of the overall retail landscape. How should we think about some of the big initiatives or the big picture initiatives to drive same-store sales trends in 2014 and beyond?", "Kathy Tesija", "You know Sean, I think a lot of the things that I talked about today with product as well as with in-store experience and our mobile experience, those are really the key things for us to help drive people to shop at Target beyond the food that you talked about and of course the REDcard.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just on the food, I guess, aspect of things, how are you on the in-stocks in that particular category and are you happy with the product that you have out there on the shelf today?", "Kathy Tesija", "Yes, in-stocks have been rock solid for quite some time. In terms of products, I would tell you that we're always making adjustments to what we carry in-stores. We learn what selling and what trends are picking up steam, things like organics and better for your products. So that's a never-ending thing that we work on.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. And then just one last thing you mentioned the online and the flexible fulfillment, I think that all of those can now be viewed online which is great for the consumer, but when do you think or is it going to be possible for all of those products for buying online and picking up in-store?", "Kathy Tesija", "We are expanding the assortment right now. I don't have a date for you in terms of when we'll get our whole assortment up online. And right now we're focusing on the most popular items and categories that we recently added pets, for example, and we'll just continue to expand as we learn more and more about that program.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks a lot and good morning. I've got two questions and the first relates to inventory. I know you cleared a lot of inventory in Canada. Your year-on-year numbers still across the corporation, across the enterprise is still up quite substantially relative to sales. So if you could comment on sort of the composition of that inventory and your thought process for its impact on margin going forward?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Sure. Inventory up about 10% year-over-year and you can roughly think about that split about equally between Canada and the U.S. Canada obviously we're just in a different place than we were a year ago. We built inventories all year as we opened stores. I would tell you in Canada we feel much, much better. We feel very good about the progress we made in the fourth quarter clearing excess inventory. The average inventory per store in Canada from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter was down about 30%. So we still have some lingering issues in Q1 with some long lean receipts but feel very good about the inventory there. In the U.S., I would tell you the merchant team did an outstanding job reacting to the change in sales and our inventories are in excellent shape. This is the time of year where in February we are changing lots of things in the store and frankly depending on where you snap the line for yearend relative to our receipts, we see inventory move around a little bit. If you go back over the past couple of years, our inventory per store in the U.S. is up about 3% versus two years ago. So this is really more timing than anything else and we feel very good about the inventory position.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up really is to capital allocation and specifically the buyback. I know that you alluded to the company's desire to maintain its current credit rating and that you spoke about resuming buybacks as the year progressed presuming that you are on plan. I just want to talk about what your thought process is for contingent fees? Based on the numbers we've looked at, it seems like you're a long way from coming close to the edge on your current credit rating. So what would it take for you not to do that $1 billion to $2 billion? It seems like that should be well within your financial capacity even if frankly the numbers are a bit light of your current guide?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Well, we should go offline and review where you think we are versus our credit rating and where we think we are versus our credit rating. We've actually run pretty close to our credit rating not just last year, which was even higher, but for the past several years. So our view is that we think we can do, given our plans between $1 billion and $2 billion. We need to see our business results improve over the next couple of quarters. We're starting to see that in February as we alluded to. And then also get a little bit of a view into what the potential costs are that maybe coming our way as a result of the breach. But given all of that, we still think somewhere in $1 billion to $2 billion beginning probably in the back half of the year for the year makes sense.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just finally, I know you're not going to quantify the cost of the breach, but it sounds like and thinking about the capacity to buy back stock you have somewhere internally a sense of that number that would enable you to pursue that course?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "As we said, it's not estimable at this time what the potential cost of the breach is and given where we are in the process, it'd be inappropriate for me to speculate.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Fair enough. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Hi. Thanks. I had a couple of questions. Just a quick follow-up on the breach costs. You showed a net, you got some insurance payments from the breach cost that you had. Should we expect that or do you have any insurance for these potential costs whatever they may be or is that sort of a one-off in the quarter? Then a follow-up.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Just to be clear, that was insurance receivable, so we haven't actually received payment but we feel very likely to receive payment for a portion of the expenses we incurred in the fourth quarter. What we can say about insurance right now is at this point we think there's $44 million of insurance that we'll receive. And to the extent that number changes, we'll be back here to provide more information.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Okay, great. And a bigger picture on REDcard and traffic. I mean traffic was down 5.5% in the quarter. Presumably post the breach it was down \u2013 pick a number like 7% or 8%. Is it fair to say that traffic has recovered back to what it was in January and February where we are now and how is REDcard seasoning [ph]? Those people have now had it for three of four years, how are those people behaving following the breach? Thanks.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, on traffic you're view of what happened post the breach is pretty accurate and we have seen traffic continue to improve and firm up and definitely throughout February we've seen traffic firm up. And as we said, sales have improved and a big part of that has been traffic. On the REDcard what we've seen and Kathy talked about this a little bit, in our REDcard guest, they've continued to shop with us and we've seen very strong sales from that. REDcard penetration continues to grow meaningfully hundreds of basis points year-over-year. And to the extent we're not growing where we used to that's driven by new accounts. So the guests who have REDcards continue to shop our stores.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "So it's more of the penetration growth from new people signing up or from people that signed up shopping more?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "As has been the case over the past couple of year, the penetration growth comes from new accounts.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Thanks a lot. Good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securitie0073", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little more color on the top spreads that you're seeing between states that have been severely impacted by weather and some of your warmer weather states?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Great question, Matt. It's analyzing weather isn't a perfect science. I would say when we see \u2013 in the Midwest, in the Northeast when we've seen these weather patterns go across the country, the spread is significant between the two. But ultimately as that passes, we see them re-stabilize and everything come back to normal. But the difference while it is going on is pretty dramatic. It's in single digits difference but it'd be high single digits.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, you gave some great detail on your investments in digital and ecommerce this year. As you enable click and collect and fulfillment from store, are there any significant investments you need to make in terms of inventory, accuracy in the store and could you just give us maybe a bit of color on how that's running in terms of being able to pick up in-store?", "Kathy Tesija", "We're always working on inventory accuracy and that is a combination of how we use our systems as well as the processes in-store. And so it's been less of an issue to date as we get into some of the additional categories, things like beauty where there's a lot of SKUs, we got to make sure that the accuracy is there. I will tell you apparel, while we've had good results there, it's a little bit harder partly accuracy but partly being able to find the exact size when it's not in a planogrammed environment. So there are a few challenges for us to figure out, but overall I would tell you that our guest response has been very positive in the survey comments that they have back to us. They really love the service. So, yes, we will keep working on accuracy to make sure that we can fulfill as many orders as possible. But so far we're very pleased.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then lastly, your SG&A per foot in the U.S. was down pretty substantially in the fourth quarter versus the last few years. Well how should we think about SG&A per foot on a full-year basis for \u201914 in the U.S. should it -- is that a number that you can keep relatively flat or is there just some inherent inflation there that we should expect?", "Gregg Steinhafel", "First, the comparison to last year we have to be a little bit careful, there\u2019s a 53rd week in there that\u2019s a relatively low volume week which creates a little bit of distortion year-over-year. But I think, as I said we continue to work very hard on store productivity ensuring that we\u2019re driving great guest experience and in-stocks, but also improving our productivity. And then all of the expense optimization efforts continued to go on and some portion of that will fall to the bottom line, some portion of that goes to gross margin and some portion of that gets reinvested in the business as we invest in multi-channel technology supply chain. But I think flat to up slightly is probably about the best way to think about it.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. Good luck this year.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Nomura.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions, first on -- you gave a number on the online business in terms of the increase that you had in the fourth quarter?", "Kathy Tesija", "We didn\u2019t give a number, but I\u2019ll tell you it's very positive above the industry and slightly above 20%.", "John Mulligan", "Well I\u2019d be honest to the business, it was impacted by the breach as well.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Okay. And then, when you look at the full-year, actually pointing out you gave a lot of details, in terms of like the sales recovery that you have, what are the key factors that gave you the comfort and confidence in the recovery over this year as you plan the earnings and sales trajectory?", "John Mulligan", "Well, it's from our perspective we got to up our game on all fronts, it starts with delivering great content, great in-stocks, our team is more engaged than ever from a service standpoint both on the sales floor and at the lanes. And we\u2019re going to deliver as Kathy said just some eye popping irresistible deals. So we\u2019re going to really up the [ante] [ph] as it relates to making a statement on our unbeatable pricing proposition which we have. I mean we price matched the competition, and we run our circulars and with our 5% REDcard rewards program our pricing, our value proposition is unbeatable. So we\u2019re just going to call greater attention to that and selectively we\u2019re going to go out and be more aggressive in that regard. And so it's the combination of all of those elements.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "And then on the gross margin outlook for Canada, can you just talk about the mix assumptions in there and sort of also like the ramp from where you finished fourth quarter to get to that 30% number for the year?", "John Mulligan", "Sure, mix in Canada continues to be stronger in apparel and home. And we expect that to moderate through time. We ultimately think the mix there will be stronger than what we see in the U.S. but a lot like our high volume stores in the U.S. our urbane stores in the U.S. we see a higher mix of home and apparel sales. That will moderate through time because we want to drive the frequency categories, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on the team in Canada ultimately if they\u2019re successful in driving conversion and commodities, grocery, food all those categories we\u2019ll see that mix moderate. I think we\u2019ll see margin \u2013 we expect to see some volatility, Q1 for instance the margin rate won't be at 30%, but it will be significantly improved from the 4.4% we recorded in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019ll make progress and you should expect to see that throughout the year and of course back in fourth quarter next year we\u2019ll be down a little bit from that 30% as it's typical on our U.S. business given that time of year.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Okay, we have time for one more question please.", "Operator", "Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities", "Thanks and good morning. A couple of random questions, so could you perhaps breakout how much was the explicit impact of the 10% off deal that you did after the breach and right ahead of Christmas?", "John Mulligan", "Chris we don\u2019t breakout promotions individually, it was a big time of year and the number was relatively large but in the big scheme in the fourth quarter I would tell you it's not material.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities", "Okay. And then on the cost savings side, I guess how much of the billion dollars is done so far and what has been the big drivers this year that have taken those costs out?", "John Mulligan", "There\u2019s $200 million that we recorded in 2014 we\u2019ll annualize on that next year. And the savings came from all over the corporation. There were savings in gross margin around transportation expenses that will grow again in 2014. There were savings really it's for it to pin it down, it was literally across the entire organization where we looked at things. We looked at how we sourced product and aligning our non-retail product that we source in services and making that look more like we do in merchandising and we saw significant savings there from our sourcing. There\u2019s more to do there and we\u2019ll see that grow in 2014 as well. But as Gregg said it was literally across the entire organization where we were focused on stopping things that we didn\u2019t need to do, I mean if we did need to do them improving productivity.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities", "And then, one last one; how would have the \u2013 if you had chip technology in your stores this past year how would the breach outcomes change, would it stop the actual CES to the credit card data or would it stop the personal information disclosure?", "John Mulligan", "The chip technology makes it such that using the account numbers without the card becomes very, much more difficult. And so the desire to obtain those card numbers goes down significantly. What we\u2019ve seen in other countries that have adopted chip technology as fraud rates go down dramatically for in-store transactions. I think in the U.K. or Europe I can\u2019t remember exactly down like 60%, once chip technology was enabled. And so the desire, those account numbers just become less desirable.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities", "But didn\u2019t the breach actually come from systems internally not necessarily coming from the card readers.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Yes, Chris we\u2019re in the middle of an investigation and we can\u2019t talk about the specifics. We continue to learn, there\u2019ll be learning\u2019s that come out of that investigation and from those learning\u2019s we\u2019ll take actions and that\u2019s about what we can say today.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities", "Fair enough. Thanks very much.", "Gregg Steinhafel", "Okay. Well, that concludes Target\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation.", "Operator", "Again thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 21, 2014.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning and thank you for joining us on our 2014 first quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are John Mulligan, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain officer. ", "This morning, John will provide a high level summary of our first quarter results and strategic priorities for the remainder of the year, then Kathee will discuss results in the U.S and Canada, guest insights, and plans for the second quarter and beyond. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John for a review of the quarter and our priorities going forward. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, John. First off today, I want to thank the Target team for their energy and commitment. The first quarter was unusually challenging as we worked hard to help our guests recover from the data breach. Because of the team\u2019s efforts, traffic and sales trends have improved substantially and we\u2019re in a much better position today than we were just three months ago. ", "Also, before I turn to the first quarter operating results, I want to briefly discuss the board\u2019s recent announcement of Gregg Steinhafel\u2019s departure and the initiation of a comprehensive internal and external search for a permanent replacement. I want to thank Greg for all his contributions to Target over his 35 year career and I\u2019m humbled to follow him into this role, even on an interim basis. With the full support of the board, Kathee and I, along with the rest of the leadership team, have made it clear to the entire Target team that we are not going to wait for a permanent CEO to improve our operations and performance. We are already taking important steps, including management changes announced yesterday to move the organization forward. ", "This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.70, above the midpoint of our guidance. This is the result of generally in line performance in both the U.S and Canada, combined with a better than expected tax rate driven by a variety of small matters, none of which was individually significant. Our U.S segment comparable sales decline of 0.3% was near the upper end of our guidance and reflects meaningful improvement from trends we were experiencing shortly after the breach.", "When we survey consumers, we increasingly hear that they have put the breach behind them and they\u2019re resuming their Target shopping habits. We\u2019re pleased with this progress and continuing to take steps that reinforce our commitment to earn back the trust of our guests. We recently announced that we\u2019ve hired Bob DeRodes as our new Chief Information Officer and I\u2019m confident that Bob is the right person to lead our technology transformation and data security remediation efforts. That same day, we also announced the important decision to move all of our REDcards under MasterCard\u2019s industry leading chip-and-PIN technology. This decision, along with our accelerated rollout of chip-enabled card readers to all of our stores by this September, are among many crucial steps we\u2019re taking to restore confidence among our guests, that it\u2019s safe to shop at Target.", "The first quarter Canadian segment results were also largely in line with our expectations. Sales were just below the expected range, driven by softness early in the quarter. While losses were meaningfully in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re still far from where we need to be. We continued to roll out enhanced tools and technology. We\u2019ve increased the intensity of our volume messaging, and we\u2019ve made several important changes to the Target Canada leadership team during the quarter. As a result, we\u2019re beginning to see improved guest satisfaction measures regarding in-stocks and price perception. While these early signs of progress indicate that we're moving in the right direction, we're committed to moving faster.", "As we look ahead to the second quarter and beyond, the Board and our team are aligned on three priorities. The first is growing traffic and sales in our U.S. segment. While the environment is challenging, we can do better. We need to improve on something we've historically done well, delivering unique products and services at great prices. As a result, we're working quickly to drive more newness in our merchandising and presentation, helping to keep Target top in mind with guests by continually reminding them why they fell in love with Target in the first place.", "Second, we must improve our Canadian segment performance. Canada is a great market and Target is a great retailer, but so far, we have not lived up to our potential or our expectations. Improving operations is key, but we need to think broadly about all aspects of our business and whether other changes are needed. We've made changes to the Target Canada leadership team so they could take a hard look at our current performance and apply fresh thinking about how to improve.", "Finally, we need to accelerate our digital transformation and become a leading Omni-channel retailer. To do this, we'll move more quickly to become more flexible in how we serve our guests, eliminating barriers that prevent them from shopping with us, where and when they want. This includes delivering products and services more flexibly in our stores or anywhere else the guest wants to receive them. ", "Our common theme across all of these priorities is a continued focus on our guests, not just the ones we currently have, but the potential guests who aren't shopping with us today. We need to listen intently to all of them, how they're feeling, what they want and how well we're serving them. With that knowledge, we need to make decisions based on what will inspire them, deepening their love for Target by making their lives easier and apply all of our energy to make that happen.", "Finally, we know we can't accomplish any of this unless we unleash the talents of our great team. So we are focused on prioritizing and aligning our efforts to provide greater clarity and removing roadblocks that have been slowing our team down. We will empower them to take smart risks and hold ourselves accountable for learning quickly from the results. We have been on this journey for some time, but the Board believes and we agree that we can accelerate our progress. Given the recent announcements of leadership changes, many of you asked what is going to change. While that is certainly important, I want to make sure we discuss what is and is not going to change. ", "What clearly will change includes our emphasis on speed throughout the organization, our commitment to more rapid improvement in Canada, our focus on digital and becoming a leading Omni-channel retailer, and the level of investment in newness and innovation and what we offer to our guests. While we work for those goals, we'll continue to develop smaller, more flexible store formats to allow us to serve guests in markets that can accommodate our larger store layouts. We'll continue our expense optimization efforts. Our goal is not to cut our way to prosperity, but to free up resources we can leverage and support a faster growth.", "Finally, our point of view on capital deployment remains the same. This has always been a Board level discussion and we continue to be aligned with them on the following priorities; invest everything appropriate in our core business on projects that will support Target's growth and generate superior returns; support the dividend and build on our record of more than 40 years of annual dividend increases. And beyond those first two uses, return cash through share repurchase when we have room within our middle A credit ratings. The Board has made it clear that they agree with these priorities and that our leadership team has their full support. Our mission from the Board is clear; provide focus, remove roadblocks and unleash the team to move faster. As Jeff Jones, our Chief Marketing Officer likes to say, interim will not mean idle. We're committed to making real changes now, accelerating our transformation during this transition period, while the Board conducts its search for a permanent CEO.", "Now, Kathee will provide more details on first quarter results, second quarter plans and key priorities for the remainder of the year. Kathee?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Thanks John. As John mentioned, we entered the first quarter during a tumultuous time for our U.S. business as traffic and sales trends were still recovering from the meaningful declines we saw following the data breach. Our plan was clear; make Target irresistible to our guests with exciting content and compelling deals. Our efforts produced mixed results for the quarter, reflecting unfavorable weather in February, followed by the strongest results in March and weaker than expected Easter sales in April. In total, first quarter performance was meaningfully better than the fourth quarter as comparable sales improved by more than 2 percentage points and comparable transactions improved even more.", "In our U.S. business, first quarter comparable sales were strongest in hard lines, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in electronics, which continues to benefit from strong trends in mobile. Comparable sales in our less discretionary food, health and beauty categories were slightly positive, while home and apparels saw small comp declines, with our digital channels' first quarter sales were strongest in health and beauty and home.", "U.S. segment comparable traffic was down a little more than 2%, which was nearly offset by a healthy 2.1% increase in basket size. Within the average basket, we saw an increase in both units and average retail, reflecting our continued success in attracting guests to add more items to their carts and trade up to higher price points. First quarter digital visits were up more than 20% from a year ago, which according to comScore was the fastest growth among a group consisting of Target and seven of our largest online competitors. The share of digital visits from a mobile phone or a tablet continues to grow and in the first quarter, almost two-thirds of our digital traffic was on one of these devices. ", "Conversion rates on both our conventional and mobile sites improved in the first quarter driving an increase in overall conversion despite the mixed headwind created by the shift into mobile. The combined benefit of traffic and conversion improvements drove first quarter digital channel sales up more than 30% from last year. Our U.S. segment first quarter gross margin rate was down more than 1 percentage point from last year as our team focused on providing irresistible deals for our guests. Based on the success of fourth quarter promotions prior to the data breach, we had already planned for a steady drumbeat of compelling offers this spring. ", "However, following the data breach, we decided to ramp up the intensity of these promotions even more to motivate guests to reestablish their shopping routine at Target. For example, in late February, we offered Five 12 packs of Coke products for $10, our lowest price in more than a decade. In early March, we featured a spring cleaning incentive, offering $20 in savings when guests spent $50 on cleaning products. Also in March, our shoe sale featured a buy one, get one half off promotion. And in April, we ran a Cartwheel offer to save an extra 10% on 42 of our biggest deals from the front and back cover of our weekly ad.", "In the U.S., to help reinforce Target as the destination to shop for anything, anytime, anywhere, we've launched the yearlong Target Run marketing campaign, featuring national and owned brand items across categories like food, personal care, baby, paper and pets. This Run campaign will change with seasons and other timely events and is intended to make Target our guest destination for those fill-in trips they might consider making at a drug or a grocery store. While there is certainly more work to do, we are pleased that so many of our guests have responded to our promotions and moved beyond the data breach to resume their Target shopping habits.", "In fact, recent survey research show that the vast majority of our lapsed guests, those who had changed their shopping habits and not visited Target since the data breach, had come back for at least one visit by the end of the first quarter. And while irresistible first quarter promotions were key to reinforcing the pay less side of our brand promise, we were equally focused on initiatives that offer newness and deliver on the expect more side of that promise. We led off the quarter with the February launch of Peter Pilotto for Target. Guests in the U.S. and Canada and worldwide through our collaboration with Net-A-Porter responded enthusiastically to Target's exclusive collection of women's apparel, accessories and swimwear. ", "Home is already one of our fastest growing online categories, and while we feel good about our opening price point offerings, we believe we can more fully serve guests at higher price points. To begin addressing this opportunity, in March, Target.com launched over 2,000 new furniture items from Safavieh, a brand that online guests recognize for having great style at an accessible price. Target's assortment features stylish items and furniture, rug, lighting and soft home, including many Target exclusives. Safavieh anchored the spring home sale during April week three and was showcased on the Target.com homepage and we're happy with early sales results.", "Guests are increasingly looking for natural, organic and sustainable products that are better for them and their families. So in March, we launched Made to Matter hand-picked by Target, a first of its kind collection that brings together 16 leading natural organic and sustainable brands to showcase new products and make them more accessible for our guests. The Made to Matter products span six categories featured both in our regular locations and in specialized displays, while select products are available at Target.com and our mobile app. We'll be adding new items to this collection throughout the year and enticing guests to try these products with offers on Cartwheel.", "Also in the first quarter, we were blown away by the response to the release of Disney's Frozen on DVD and Blu-ray, and we saw amazing results across music, movies and books. In fact, when Frozen was released on DVD and Blu-ray in March, it became the most successful first day release for any movie in Target history. And in the short time since, the movie has become Target's biggest movie ever. In the first month alone, we sold more units than we sold in the first year of Finding Nemo, which previously held the record for our biggest release. In children's books, Frozen continues to be the number one license in the first quarter and we sold hundreds of thousands of units since its set last September. And finally in music, the Frozen soundtrack also held the number one spot throughout the first quarter, selling more units in April than all of our other releases combined. ", "Cartwheels just celebrated its one-year anniversary, having far outpaced our expectations. Cartwheel has attracted more than 7 million users in that time, most of whom continue to use Cartwheel after their first redemption. Cumulative Cartwheel savings have grown past $70 million and our active Cartwheel users have on average increased their trips and spend at Target by nearly 30%, driving hundreds of millions of incremental sales from these households. And in the first quarter, we saw a 33% increase in new Cartwheel users when we integrated the app into our weekly ad for the first time. ", "We continue to see encouraging results from our recent rollout of in-store pickup of digital orders. These orders make up about 10% of our digital transactions and when guests pick up their items, more than 20% of the time, they take the opportunity to shop the store and spend much more than our average basket. In the first quarter, we expanded the number of SKUs eligible for in-store pickup to more than 60,000, including some shelf stable grocery items.", "Following a successful shift from store tests with Minneapolis team members, we are planning to launch a guest facing $10 rush delivery pilot in June in the Minneapolis, Boston and Miami markets, offering guests the ability to order as late as 1.30 p.m. in the afternoon and receive a delivery of qualifying items between 6.00 p.m. and 9.00 p.m. the same day. Later in the year, we plan to rollout standard shipping from 136 stores in 38 markets across the country. By leveraging the store network as fulfillment centers, we can offer faster, standard shipping, typically one to two days and provide access to store only items not previously available from Target.com. We will continue to monitor results to determine further rollout plans. ", "As John mentioned in Canada, we continue to enhance our operations in the first quarter and our in-stocks have started to show meaningful improvement. At the same time, we ramped up our promotional intensity to show our guests the depth, breadth and pricing of our assortment in frequency categories, and our guests have taken notice. In a recent survey of Canadian guests, we saw double-digit improvements in favorable responses to questions regarding our in-stocks, whether we provide a good value, our everyday pricing and the quality of our deals. First quarter Canadian segment sales were slightly below plan, driven by softness in February and March and stronger performance in April. Our gross margin rate of 18.7% improved dramatically from the fourth quarter, but it remains far below where it needs to be as we continue to clear excess inventory on long lead receipts.", "While our progress in Canada is encouraging, we have an opportunity to move much faster. Yesterday, we announced that Mark Schindele has assumed the role of President, Target Canada, reporting to me. Mark is a strong leader who has spent the last 15 years at Target. He has broad experience in merchandising and operations and he will bring a fresh perspective to the Target Canada team. Mark will join Janna Adair Potts who recently took on responsibility for our Canadian Stores and Distribution; John Butcher, our new leader of Merchandising in Canada; Livia Zufferli, who leads Target Canada, Marketing; Tiffany Monroe, who leads Target Canada Human Resources; and Mark Wong, Target Canada's General Counsel; as they elevate all aspects of our Canadian business and implement changes to improve our performance. Yesterday, we also announced that Target will be naming a Non-Executive Chair in Canada, someone with deep knowledge and expertise in the Canadian market who will collaborate with the President of Target Canada to ensure our strategies and tactics align with the Canadian marketplace.", "Here in the U.S, as we survey our guests and monitor consumer sentiment, we continue to see what we have seen for some time; signs of optimism, combined with reasons for continued caution. On the positive side, recent stock market highs, slow but persistent job growth and rising home values, are driving improved consumer sentiment metrics. However, lack of income growth among more moderate income families and persistent lack of household formation are hampering the pace of recovery. Given our exposure to lower and middle income households, the environment remains challenging overall and we face the additional challenge of addressing the lingering effects of the data breach.", "Consumer survey data shows that we've made substantial progress on measures of Target's favorability and integrity in the U.S. and they are approaching levels we were seeing prior to the data breach. However, while trust measures have improved as well, we need to make more progress to restore them to pre-breach levels. That's why we're focused on delivering on our commitment to accelerate the rollout of chip-and-PIN on our cards and in our stores, along with many other visible steps we are taking to increase the security of the entire U.S. card payment system.", "As John mentioned, for the remainder of the year, we're working quickly to enhance the flow of newness and innovation in our products, presentation and promotions. For the second quarter, we've lined up compelling deals, services and products designed to accelerate trips to Target across all of our channels. We are further enhancing our mobile platform to improve the experience and drive continued increases in conversion. Advancements underway are planned for this year, include more sorting options for guests shopping on a mobile device, a save for later option in the mobile basket, better visibility to our in-store pickup capabilities, streamline mobile checkout and dynamic customized landing pages.", "We're also growing services like Target Subscriptions that make life easier for our guests. With very little marketing, the pilot of our subscriptions program quickly grew to account for more than 15% of Target.com sales on eligible items. As a result, we recently enhanced the program by expanding eligible items nearly 10-fold and offering a 5% discount on all subscription orders, helping our guests save even more time and money. We're continuing to integrate last year's acquisitions into Target's digital and store experiences. At DermStore, we're testing integration into our weekly digital ad and we'll begin selling DermStore gift cards in all stores in July. ", "At CHEFS and Cooking.com, we're working to integrate their site content into our overall digital experience, continuing to expand the CHEFS assortment on Target.com and promoting both digital brands through inserts in millions of Target.com orders for cooking and kitchen items. Beyond acquisitions, we're excited about our investment in startup company Cosmic Cart, which offers a universal shopping cart for publishing websites and blogs. Their technology allows retailers to make sales directly from Cosmic Cart affiliate sites and allows shoppers to easily buy items while browsing online content. Beyond our investment, Target incubated the Cosmic Cart team at our Minneapolis headquarters for three months. During that time, the team built a white label product for Target to use on our own online and social channels. This product allows shoppers to purchase a Target product they see on a specific channel like the Instagram page of Target Style without having to leave to checkout on Target.com. We look forward to seeing how our guests respond to Cosmic Cart as we continue to test new ways to use their technology. ", "Our wedding and baby registries have always been a smart way to shop for guests, but in U.S. stores this summer, they'll get even smarter with new web enabled, iPod based scanners that give guests a much more user friendly experience.", "In apparel, earlier this month, we launched a new exclusive Mossimo Supply Company apparel collection in partnership with San Francisco based artist and avid surfer, Jeff Canham. This collection of classic surf inspired apparel includes tees, tanks, sport shorts, flip flops and beach towels.", "Also this month, we launched the new Archer Farms Mix & Match Meals program in all of our SuperTarget and PFresh locations, more than 1,500 stores in all. With this program, guests can create a custom design meal for their family of four that's ready in 10 to 15 minutes and costs less than $18. These meals are comprised of unique sauces, fresh, cut and pre-washed vegetables, fully cooked pastas and starches and all natural pre-cooked meats. And of course, we're investing in service, in-store service and layout enhancements that will continue to differentiate the Target experience.", "In baby, we've heard from guests that they love shopping our stores, but want help in making the smartest choices. Our enhanced baby experience provides just that with dedicated service, enhanced technology, expert information from BabyCenter and an easier to shop layout that allows guests to try out items like strollers. We expanded the test of this layout to nearly 30 stores this spring on our way to more than 200 locations this summer.", "Like baby, the beauty category can be overwhelming and we want to inspire, educate and engage our guests. Our Beauty Concierge program, currently in more than 400 stores, offers guests the opportunity to interact with brand agnostic, non-commission-based advisors who help them feel confident in their purchases, driving sales through increased trips and bigger baskets.", "This spring, we executed the largest physical update to the skincare and cosmetic aisles since 2001. The new environment includes brighter, more inviting LED lighting, large backlit signage, highlighting product attributes and ingredients to help informed decisions and shelving that allows for brand customization and cleaner presentations.", "In entertainment and electronics, we're testing a new layout that invites guests to discover products and make more informed purchase decisions. Examples include discovery tables to display featured items and allow guests to interact and play with products as well as the integration of all children's books, movies and video game products in convenient locations. In addition to physical changes, this test incorporates enhanced team member training on product features and functionality. This redesigned experience is currently being tested in 17 stores and will determine future plans based on guests feedback.", "Based on our experience in Canada and our CityTarget stores, we are testing enhanced displays including mannequins, which elevate the environment and help our guests save time by providing navigational cues throughout the area. Based on positive results from a limited test this spring, we plan to roll out enhanced apparel displays to 50 additional stores this summer and several hundred more stores this fall. We're in early stages of a test of a new toy floor pad that offers more hands-on experiences where families can explore and interact with products. The reinvention offers fun, interactive experiences, including larger than life toys and features streamlined shelving to improve sightlines for the guest. Based on results of this small test, we expect to rollout this layout to a number of additional stores this fall. ", "In Canada, we're introducing a new format for the Flyer, their version of our weekly circular with a radical, new design based on feedback from our Canadian guests. The new format features a clean design, bolder price points and more products across all categories. We will use a consistent format each week that separates needs from wants, making it clear to our guests that we offer great deals on both. Specifically, we're adding an eight to 12 page wrap filled with frequency items so that the actual flyer has more room for discretionary categories like apparel and accessories, kids, seasonal and home; the categories, Canadian guests most associate with Target. And to further drive awareness and consideration of Target's frequency categories, Target Canada launched an integrated essentials marketing campaign highlighting products such as laundry detergent, diapers, grocery, multivitamins and more. The check it off your list for less campaign, which includes radio, TV, digital and the flyer launched on March 14th and is planned to run for 18 weeks.", "While we've made considerable progress in the first quarter, the entire leadership team is working to achieve faster growth in the U.S, dramatically improve Canadian segment performance and accelerate Target's digital transformation. To accomplish this goal, we're going to leverage the fantastic assets we already have, a world class brand, a strong network of newly built or remodeled stores across the U.S. and Canada, strong partnerships with leading national brands, combined with a set of powerful, owned and exclusive brands, which benefit from our design and sourcing capabilities and most importantly, a motivated and talented team that's eager to win in the marketplace. ", "Beyond the changes to the Canada team, yesterday we also announced changes to my team in the U.S, which will better leverage functional expertise to speed up innovation, drive newness and accelerate our digital transformation. With these changes, the team will be more agile, better positioned to deliver increased traffic and sales in the U.S. on our way to becoming a leading Omni-channel retailer. These leadership changes are among several we've made to focus our priorities and remove roadblocks that might slow down our teams. With these changes in place, we believe we can move faster and a team has enthusiastically embraced the challenge.", "Now, I'll turn it back over to John who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our second quarter and full year outlook. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks Kathee. As Kathee mentioned, our first quarter results were markedly better than our fourth quarter performance, specifically compared with the trends we were seeing late in the fourth quarter following the announcement of the data beach. In the U.S. segment, our comparable sales decline of 0.3% was near the high end of our guidance and flat to down 2%. Comparable traffic declined 2.3%, dramatically better than our late fourth quarter trends, but well below where we should perform over time. Consistent with broader trends in the U.S. market traffic, traffic in our stores has been declining, while transactions in our digital channels have been growing rapidly, particularly in mobile. ", "However, given the relative size of these two channels at Target today, the mix effect of these opposing trends is driving a decline in overall transactions. The key to reversing this decline is clear; accelerate our digital capabilities and leverage assets across both our physical and digital channels to lead guests to choose us more often than they are today. The distinction between channels is increasingly unimportant because single transactions are already straddling both the physical and digital channels. Ultimately, we should be agnostic about which channels guests choose and enable them to interact with us where and when they want to; in our stores, digitally, or preferably both.", "First quarter penetration on our REDcards was 20.4%, up 3.3 percentage points from last year. This is very healthy growth, but a couple of percentage points below rates we were seeing prior to the data breach. In the first quarter, as research showed that most consumers are putting the breach behind them, we ramped up REDcard offers to guests in our stores, and by the end of the quarter, we were making those offers with the same frequency as before the breach. When we make an offer, the application rate for our credit card has largely recovered to pre-breach levels, but the rate for the debit card is responding less quickly. As a result, we expect slower U.S. REDcard penetration growth in the second quarter, up between 200 basis points and 300 basis points from last year. Looking ahead as part of our broader effort to rebuild traffic and sales, we work hard to reaccelerate REDcard growth, particularly the debit product through our marketing and an enhanced focus on the role our store team members play in generating REDcard applications. ", "Our first quarter U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.5%, down nearly a percentage point from last year, driven by a gross margin to current rate decline of more than one percentage point.", "As Kathee mentioned, we ramped up the intensity of our deals in the first quarter to get guests back into our stores and this decision was reflected both in better sales in traffic and a lower gross margin rate. Our SG&A rate improved about 30 basis points from last year, reflecting outstanding discipline across the Company, including the benefit of our expense optimization efforts as well as the timing of some expenses compared to last year.", "In our Canadian segment, first quarter sales were below expectations in February and March, but were better than expected in April. Our first quarter gross margin rate was 18.7%, much better than the fourth quarter, but still below our full year expectation as we worked to clear excess inventory on long lead time receipts. Expense rates were much better than a year ago, reflecting scale benefits and the comparison to last year's preopening costs. ", "First quarter REDcard penetration was 3.9% was nearly double last year's rate, but still well below where we believe it will be over time. ", "Consistent with last quarter beyond operating results, our first quarter GAAP earnings reflected several items that reduced EPS by approximately $0.04. These items included data breach related costs net of an insurance receivable, continued reduction and the beneficial interest asset and a charge related to our decision to move from Visa to MasterCard for our co-branded REDcard credit product.", "Turning to consolidated metrics, our first quarter interest expense of $170 million was down more than $450 million from a year ago, as we annualized the first quarter 2013 charge for the early retirement of high coupon debt.", "We returned $272 million in dividends this quarter, up from $232 million last year as our $0.43 per share quarterly dividend was more than 19% higher than a year ago. We plan to recommend that our Board authorize another similar increase this summer.", "We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter. While we expect to generate cash well beyond our expected uses over the next several years, our current metrics are beyond typical boundaries of our middle A cart rating. As a result, we do not expect to repurchase shares in the second quarter and may resume repurchases in the back half of the year at the earliest. To resume this activity, we need to see continued improvement in our U.S. and Canadian operations, moving our credit metrics back to acceptable levels, relative to our single A rating. In addition, we believe it's prudent to hold off on any repurchases until we have more visibility into our potential liability for third party, card networks fraud and administrative costs related to the data breach. Based on what we know today, we do not expect to have visibility into those claims until the third quarter or later.", "I'll turn now to our outlook for both the second quarter and our updated expectations for the full year. Given our current trends and challenges in both the U.S. and Canada, we believe it's appropriate to maintain a cautious outlook for sales in both segments. This allows us to plan inventory and hours effectively, while building contingency plans to allow us to flex higher as sales grow more rapidly than expected. We've updated our full year expectations for profitability in both segments, taking a more cautious view in light of the environment and the additional steps we're taking to grow U.S traffic and sales, accelerate improvement in our Canadian operations and step up the development of our digital capabilities.", "While we don't expect these additional efforts to change our 2014 capital expenditures in a meaningful, we are planning for lower operating margins in both segments as we dedicate additional resources to make progress. Specifically, we expect to invest more in gross margin for newness, product innovation and promotions in both the U.S. and Canada to enhance our value proposition across both sides of the Expect More, Pay Less brand promise, and incur incremental expenses as we devote more resources to improve operations in Canada and speed up the development of digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities in the U.S. Longer-term, we believe these investments will be paid back in the form of faster, profitable growth and increasing market share in both segments.", "One note. Consistent with guidance last quarter, our outlook does not include potential additional costs related to the data breach beyond what we've already recognized as they're still not estimable. As I mentioned, we continue to believe we have the financial strength to move beyond these near-term impacts once they are known even as we continue to invest to grow in both of our segments.", "So with that context, let's turn first to our expectations for the second quarter. In the U.S, we expect a slower improvement in sales trends, meaning, second quarter comparable sales should be flat to slightly positive. We expect U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate will be below last year's 10.8% rate, but we expect a smaller year-over-year decline than we experienced in the first quarter. Both gross margin and SG&A expenses will be pressured by our efforts to grow traffic and expand our digital capabilities, but we also expect an offsetting benefit of both gross margin and SG&A expense lines from our expense optimization efforts.", "In Canada, we expect sales measured in U.S. dollars to be up about 75% from last year's second quarter and about 25% higher than the first quarter. We will report Canadian segment comparable sales for the first time in the second quarter, but this measure will be highly volatile in the near-term as we'll be measuring in our small set of stores. Specifically, we expect to report a single-digit decline in second quarter Canadian segment comparable sales as we'll be comparing against the very large grand opening surges we experienced a year ago, combined with the impact of our market densification later in 2013, which redistributed sales from our initial openers. ", "We expect the Canadian segment gross margin rate will improve beyond 20% in the second quarter, but will continue to reflect pressures from promotions and efforts to eliminate excess inventory. Expense rates in this segment should show modest improvement from our first quarter rates, but will remain elevated far beyond what they'll be in the long run. Altogether, second quarter Canadian segment EBITDA losses measured in U.S dollars are expected to be approximately flat to last year. ", "We expect second quarter consolidated interest expense to be approximately flat to last year and tax expenses to be somewhat lower. Altogether, our expectations would generate adjusted EPS reflecting results from both our U.S. and Canadian operations of $0.85 to $1, excluding $0.02 related to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential cost related to the data breach.", "For the full year, we continue to expect U.S. comparable sales in a range of flat to up 2% and we still expect an SG&A expense rate of about 20%. However, we've taken our gross margin rate expectations down below 30% to make room to invest more in products and promotion.", " In our Canadian segment, in light of recent trends we've taken down our full-year sales expectations closer to US$2 billion and with that new view of sales, we expect lower gross margin rate and higher expense rates than before. Specifically, we now expect our full-year Canadian segment EBITDA margin rate will be closer to minus 20% compared with our prior expectation closer to minus 10%. Altogether, these updated expectations will put our full-year adjusted EPS in a range of $3.60 to $3.90, $0.25 lower than the range we provided a quarter ago. ", "While these are our current expectations based on where we are today, I don't want to create the impression that we're satisfied. Recent management changes, including yesterday's announcements, demonstrate that we believe meaningful changes needed put us on a different long run trajectory. In Canada, we need much more urgency to improve our operations, so our systems and supply team can enable the rapid growth in sales we'll be driving to achieve scale. In the U.S., even though we're seeing industry leading growth in the digital channels, we need to grow even faster to catch up with others who have been on the journey for a much longer time. And we need to become much more willing to deliver more newness and differentiation to our guests. Given that we're already known for it, we need to continually raise the bar on what newness means. Providing our guests with a sense of inspiration and discovery that makes them want to visit us more often in whatever channel they choose.", "With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Two questions. The first one I want to ask is sort of a governance related question, so answer it as you can. You talked about some of the Company's initiatives and your case, strategic direction and areas where you felt perhaps the Company had fallen short. Were any of these areas, themes where perhaps Greg and the Board or Greg and the rest of the management team had a difference of opinion such that your focus on them today would be different from what the firm's focus on that had been under his leadership?", "John Mulligan", "Matt, all I can tell you is what we're focused on going forward, and we're focused -- Kathee and I and the whole leadership team have been talking to the team for the past couple of weeks about our focuses on driving the business forward, and we have three key objectives; drive sales and traffic in the U.S, accelerate our operational improvement in Canada and ultimately our business performance; and then third, accelerate our transformation and get to be a leading Omni-channel retailer in the U.S., and that's where we have the teams focused.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. and then my second question just a quick one, on Canada, if you could try to help us frame the magnitude of inventory sort of left in the pipeline that you need to clear, maybe how much of a factor that was in the grosses is Q1, and whether that\u2019s -- whether you're cleaned up at this stage?", "John Mulligan", "Matt, as you know, when sales get out of -- when sales aren't on expectation and inventories get a little heavy, they get lumpy. And so there's areas where we're a little bit heavier than we'd like. There\u2019s areas where we're a little bit lighter than we'd like, and we're working to, I'd say, balance all of the inventories. And a lot of it frankly will be dependent on do we meet our sales objectives? In the first quarter, a little bit light, but not materially so, and if we continue to hit our sales objectives, I think we'll see our inventories smooth out over the course of the year and be in a manageable position for the remainder of the year. I don't know if there's anything you'd add, Kathee?", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yeah. The thing that I would add, Matt, is we're working on making sure that our forecasts are accurate and then as we buy into them that we've got chase and cancel plans built in so that we're able to react in-season versus what we've done this past year without any history and having to react at the end of the season to clear more. So we're still lumpy. We still have products to clear. We're getting our arms around that forecast, and I think that will help us as we move through the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Nomura.", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura Securities", "Just two questions, I guess first, in terms of the search for our new CEO, is there like a reasonable timeframe that you think it can be resolved? And then the second question is on the share repurchase, you gave a lot of detail on it. Is it -- in terms of the second half confidence level, do you think that you will have better visibility? And what gives you that visibility around the cost of the breach in that third quarter? Just I'd like to better understand that situation.", "John Mulligan", "Sure. On the first question of the CEO search, certainly that's under the Board's purview and I would tell you rather than focused on time, they're focused on getting the right individual to lead the Company as I said to become an Omni-channel retailer. So that's they're focus and the time we'll take as long as it's appropriate to get the right person. On the second one on share repurchase and specifically related to the potential breach liabilities, getting visibility to that in the second half of the year there is a process that is agreed to with the networks. They get some information from their forensics investigator and then they go through a process to evaluate incremental fraud, where we may have potential liability. and then they come back to us after a period of time. And as we've looked at that historically we've seen that that's taken several months and that's why we get to the third quarter. We don't have frankly, Bob, a lot of visibly to that, but as I said, as we've looked at other incidents, that's what we've seen in the past for timing of when some of those potential liabilities may become more clear.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group", "I had a couple of questions. John and Kathee, it sounds like growing that digital is a key focus right now and driving that faster. Could you help us understand where we start from like what percentage of your sales or maybe some of the cross shopping between REDcard members and how much they shop online or maybe how those people season after they've had a REDcard a few years. Anything you have on that I think will be helpful.", "John Mulligan", "Sure. I'll talk maybe a little bit about where we are today and Kathee can talk about what we're doing to drive growth there. The sales in our business, somewhere between 2% and 3%. Digital channel originated probably in the 2.5% range right now. REDcards, given the free shipping online, we have a lot of our REDcards guests shopping online and, I think, we've talked in the past, Greg, we have a very high penetration of online orders that we free ship because of that REDcard. We think it's absolutely the right incentive or part of that loyalty package for REDcard, but it drives a very high penetration. Kathee can talk about where we're going.", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yeah. In terms of growth, Greg, mobile is where we're really focused and about two-thirds of our traffic right now comes from mobile. So we're really pleased with the results that we've seen there, not only in traffic but also conversion. We did improve conversion both in the site and on mobile and in total and you know that mobile conversion is lower than site conversion. So that headwind from the mix is there, but we still improved overall conversion. So, we're happy with that. There's also a lot of new things that we're doing. Certainly there's product introductions, I talked about the furniture a few minutes ago. There's always new stuff that we're adding on the site. We're expanding. We've got almost all store product online now, set up online, lots to be sold online. But now we're adding out in other areas where we should have a much larger section and we think online is the place to do that; things like apparel, beauty. ", "In addition to that, there's a lot of services that we are adding that are doing really well. We've talked about buy online, pick-up in store. Subscriptions has been really successful for us. We started last fall with about 150 SKUs, and in those items our online sales were about 15% in subscriptions, so with no marketing and just beta on the site. So we've now got about 1,500 items and by June we'll have 5,000 items that will be available for subscriptions. And when guests purchase those items, they'll be able to get 5% discounts for signing up for subscriptions. So, a lot of product and a lot of services that go with that to drive our growth.", "Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group", "That\u2019s great. And if I could follow up on the guidance, it sounds like it's really margin investment in Canada that has taken the guidance down if I've summarized that right. You left the comp the same in the U.S. If we get back to that zero to plus 2, do you expect traffic to be positive at all as part of that guidance, or do you think it could still be negative through the year?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah, I think, if you mean for an annual number, getting to an annual positive traffic number, very difficult. We're working hard on increasing traffic for each of the quarters, and I think our benchmark is, are we seeing continued improvement in traffic as we go sequentially. But for the full year, even if we just pick a number, ran 1 comp, I don't think we'll see positive traffic for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Nemer with Wells Fargo.", "Matthew Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "I'm just wondering on the digital transformation that you talked about. Is there a target level of investment from both the P&L and a CapEx standpoint?", "John Mulligan", "I don't think there is a target level of investment. I think first from a CapEx standpoint, our approach has been, we're going to invest in all the investments the business needs to grow profitably and generate appropriate returns. The length of time over which those returns occur, we have a very long lead time as we think about capital investment. Stores have a very long return cycle. So we're used to making investments that payback over a long period of time. From an expense standpoint, I think there probably the biggest investment and where you'll see us accelerate is in speed and doing more testing and learning. And that's not just digital, but also in our store, just getting more activities out into the business that we're testing, we're modifying and adjusting and improving on and if it doesn't work pull it back and retreat from that and learn from the testing. ", "I think the best example of that is Cartwheel. We put that out in beta. We knew there were things about the app that we didn't particularly like. Our guests let us know what they didn't like about the app. The team iterated and iterated and one year later and really not with much marketing until more recently, we have 7 million users and the app has evolved as our guests have provided us feedback. And as Kathee talked about, a lot of the merchandising initiatives in baby and in apparel and in toys and in electronics, that's the same approach we've taken. Get it out in the stores, modify it, test it somewhere else and modify and then we'll move to scale. So those are the investments we'll see in expensive. And I don't think that is limited by some false number of expense dollars we have to allocate toward it. It will be driven by the appropriateness of what we're testing.", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yeah, the thing that I would add to that, Matt, the reason for getting more out, historically we've tended to work on our newness until we felt we got to almost complete level and then we would put into pilot. The point now and John\u2019s point about Cartwheel and some of the in-store things that we're doing, we want to get it in front of our guests very quickly, get their reaction to it, so that we're fine-tuning it much more quickly and then able to move out -- to rollout at a much faster pace, with the product and a service that we know our guests will love.", "Matthew Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. And secondly, can you talk to the early cycle stores versus the later cycle stores in Canada? Anything you can share on the difference between the financial metrics in the various cohorts? Thanks.", "John Mulligan", "Yeah, as we said, we continue to see improvement across the business into April as the guest data improved and our sales performance improved and the early cycle stores continue to be the best. And it's again, almost in order down the sheet, one cycle, two cycle, three cycle, four cycle, five. So the earliest stores, the longer they've been open, they performed the better, but the good thing is all cycles are on an upward path. We're not where we need to be and we're not where we need to be versus our expectations, but it's good to start to see some progress.", "Kathryn Tesija", "And I think the key to each of those cycles and improving them is getting this history under our belt and now we can forecast more accurately as we move forward. And as John said, we're very committed to accelerating our performance in Canada and we think that it will continue to go by cycle as it has this past year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean Naughton \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Two questions, first on online and I guess, specifically Amazon, it seems to continue to infringe on Target's everyday business and increasingly the consumable category. So I guess the question is two-fold. Do you feel like that you're making good progress here on slowing the bleed of sales? And then secondly, have you seen any impact from the recent changes in your trends in markets where Amazon is now being forced to collect some sales tax online?", "John Mulligan", "I'll take the second one and then Kathee can answer the first. I think on sales tax, we definitely see an impact when Amazon collects sales tax, and particular in states that have much higher sales taxes to begin with where essentially the price differential is much more meaningful. And so we've definitely seen that impact as we've watched them collect sales taxes across the country. And Kathee can talk about the rest.", "Kathryn Tesija", "Yeah. In terms of our online business, the part that I'm very encouraged about is that as comScore reports, when we look at traffic on our site versus the top seven retailers, we led by far. And obviously Amazon has a lot of traffic, but it was flat in the quarter and ours was up considerably. So I'm pleased with the changes that we're making to this site with the user experience. And the added product that we're adding is driving that guest behavior and that we're seeing the traffic. Clearly Amazon is doing very well and they have in the consumables category a lot of business. We are now ramping that up, starting with some more style-related consumable business. If you think beauty, for example, you'll see us pushing forward their faster versus grocery which we're doing dry grocery now, but we're not working on refrigerated and frozen at this point.", "Sean Naughton \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Then, I guess the second question on the logistics side of the organization, it sounds like you're having good success with the ship from store test and then buy online and pick-up in store at 10% of the sales seems to be going relatively well. Can you talk about any of the longer term P&L benefits from these initiatives both maybe from a topline and a margin perspective?", "Kathryn Tesija", "At this point I don't think we're ready to commit to what that will do from a financial perspective. Our main focus right now is what will most resonate with our guests, getting pilots out in beta so that we can learn and experience from them. Ultimately, we have to work to be profitable on all of those, but our main goal right now is sales driven and understanding guest's behavior so that we can then tailor the assortment to suit them and be profitable at it. I will tell you, I've been really pleased with some of these new initiatives and how rapidly our guest is responding to them. ", "Store pick-up is the biggest because it's now rolled out; ship from store, which was really a Minneapolis team member test so far, we're going to be expanding that in June and make that guest facing, having that $10 rush delivery in Boston, Minneapolis and Miami. And based on our team member response and the feedback that they gave us, I think that this will also resonate with our guess, so I'm really excited to see where that goes. Then later in the year, we're going to be adding standard shipping from 135 stores in about 38 markets and that will allow faster delivery, not the express that I just talked about, but one to two-day delivery and as well as provide access to the store assortment that you can't get right now on Target.com. So, lots of good things happening; not yet ready to say what it means in terms of our sales or our profit.", "John Mulligan", "I think Kathee is exactly right. Not ready to give a lot of guidance on sales profit and how it will all work out, but I would tell you, broadly, regardless of where the profit margin rates end up, pushing incremental sales across our existing assets will be a very good thing for return on invested capital and we're very excited about that. With that, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "A couple of quick things. I guess, I was curious as to Kathee, the change in the organization structure under you in merchandising, and like I guess what really prompted this now versus six months ago or next month or waiting for and -- a formal hire of a CEO in place.", "Kathryn Tesija", "I think, the point is that we want to accelerate newness and innovation in this interim period here. We've talked about interim doesn't mean idle. We are approaching our business with as much passion and focus on improving results as we always have. And in terms of this structure, I think as John mentioned, focusing on our top three priorities and having this merchant team really focus on the U.S., improving U.S. performance and leveraging deep functional expertise to be able to speed up that innovation and newness. So, for example, putting all of our style business together, both merchandising and design all under Trish Adams, having our essentials and hard lines business all under Jose Barra, having inventory and all operations under Keri Jones, and then our Omni-channel efforts all under Casey Carl, are really important to be able to leverage that expertise and move very quickly in improving our results.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Got it. Thanks. That makes a lot of sense. If I could follow-up on that, was this something that Greg was reluctant to doing and does that have anything to do with the timing?", "Kathryn Tesija", "I'll just tell you that the Board has been very supportive on these changes. We've talked at length about getting the right people in the right chair to be able to drive our performance and we're really pleased with this structure and the people that we have leading these teams.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Got it. Thank you. And then, just the one last thing I wanted to ask and I apologize if I missed it in the discussion today, but as far as the price investments go, are they more in the consumables side, the discretionary side? Where are the areas you think you need to make an investment?", "Kathryn Tesija", "As we've been focusing on irresistible deals for our guests, we've invested in both sides. I gave you the example of the Coke ad that we ran, and I think it was in March. But we've also done broad categories on the wants side like the ultimate spring break sale or our baby sales. We're looking at really needs and wants and how do we invest in both sides to be able to delight our guests, and we've had great success in both categories.", "John Hulbert", "Thanks. That concludes our first quarter 2014 conference call. Thank you all for your participation.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 20, 2014.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert - Senior Director, Investor Communications", "Good morning and thank you for joining us on our 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.", "This morning, Brian will provide his initial impressions on joining Target and his priorities going forward, then Kathee will discuss results in the U.S and Canada and plans for the third quarter and beyond, and finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our financial outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his initial impressions of Target and his priorities going forward. Brian?", "Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Before Kathee and John provide their perspective on Target\u2019s second quarter performance, I want to take a few minutes and discuss why I made the decision to come to Target and outline my priorities over the next few months. Even before I accepted the offer to lead this company, I have known and admired Target for multiple perspectives throughout my career. As a vendor partner, I have known Target as a smart, savvy, innovative, ethical and guest focused merchandiser. As a competitor, I have known Target as a disciplined, tough, focused retailer. A company that redefined the discount space by delivering outstanding design, world-class fashion, innovative products, at amazing prices.", "As a guest, my family and I have known Target as unique place that makes shopping fun, saves us time and offers a differentiated experience based on newness and discovery. And finally, as a member of the community, I have known and admired Target for its commitment to making the places where we live and work better, both through its corporate giving programs and the commitment, the voluntarism from our team members. With my appointment as Chairman and CEO, I now have the opportunity to learn about Target from the inside and I could not be more thrilled to have the opportunity to lead this great company.", "In the weeks and months ahead, I am planning to spend a great deal of my time listening to the team here in the U.S. and Canada in both our stores and headquarter locations, hearing directly from them about what\u2019s working and importantly what we need to change. In fact, I just got back from a visit to Canada, where I spent time with the team to get a firsthand update on their review of strategy and operations. While that review is not yet complete, based on what they have learned already, the Canadian team is making broad changes as they focused on improving performance in time for the key holiday season.", "In the U.S., I have been spending time with John, Kathee and others on the leadership team to understand in detail our plans for the remainder of the year. In those discussions, I am ensuring that this team is focused on execution across every aspect of our business, particularly in the holiday season. In addition, I am deepening my understanding of Target\u2019s pipeline of omni-channel innovation and I am focused on our opportunities going forward. While I am very impressed with the progress the team has made recently, including innovations on our mobile platform, subscription service, Cartwheel and flexible fulfillment, we need to continue to move faster and grow faster than the marketplace. We need to build capabilities focused on satisfying the wants and the needs of our guest and ensuring that our digital and store operations operate seamlessly to provide a single superior experience.", "Finally, I am working with the leadership team to begin detailed planning of next year\u2019s strategy and financial results. I am impressed with the progress that John and the team made in the last three months, including a strategy review that is the most comprehensive effort I have seen in my career. Their foundational work is providing me with a fresh fact-based perspective on Target\u2019s strengths and opportunities serving as the foundation for next year\u2019s plan and beyond.", "Now, before I turn the call over to Kathee, I want to thank Roxanne Austin and John for their commitment to Target and to the team, which they demonstrated through their willingness to serve as Interim Chair and CEO over the last three months. In addition to the critical strategy work they initiated, Roxanne, John and the leadership team moved forward confidently to make important changes to internal processes, removing roadblocks, empowering teams and accelerating the pace of decision-making. While there is a lot of work ahead, I have been blown away by the passion and commitment displayed by team members across the country. This team is focused on winning in the marketplace by better serving our guests in both stores and digital channels. I look forward to working with this team to harness their passion and develop the appropriate strategies that position Target for success both today and over time.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Kathee and John for review of the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Starting with Kathee who will provide detailed plan on our category performance, merchandising plans for the third quarter and beyond. Kathee?", "Kathee Tesija - Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer", "Thanks, Brian. The second quarter marked a period of transition in both of our segments as the U.S. traffic trend improved over recent quarters and our monthly U.S. comps increased throughout the quarter. In Canada, Mark Schindele and the leadership team have been engaged in a comprehensive review of strategy and operations and are beginning to make changes to address their initial findings.", "In our U.S. business, second quarter comparable sales were strongest in hard lines driven by both toys and electronics. Comparable sales were also positive in our less discretionary food, health and beauty categories, while they were down slightly in apparel and down low single-digit in home. In our digital channels, second quarter sales, including flexible fulfillment, grew most quickly in health and beauty hard lines and home. U.S. segment comparable transactions were down 1.3% completely offset by an increase in the average basket. While we are satisfied with the traffic decline, we are pleased that the U.S. traffic trend improved a full percentage point compared with the first quarter.", "Our U.S. segment first quarter gross margin rate was down a full percentage point from last year driven by higher promotional intensity compared with the year ago. While the impact of promotions was a bit less than we experienced in the first quarter, it was more than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, reflecting a retail environment in which a broad set of competitors are leaning heavily on promotions and a consumer environment, in which shoppers are still cautious and focused on deals. However, while it\u2019s still early, we have been pleased with the results so far in the back-to-school and back-to-college season, in which we have seen improved sales trends from guests focused on the occasion rather than promotions.", "Second quarter digital sales, including flexible fulfillment increased more than 30% over last year. This increase reflects a nearly 50% increase in visits to our mobile website, including iOS and Android apps, which more than offset a decline in visits to our conventional site. Importantly, conversion continues to improve rapidly on both our conventional site and mobile platforms driving a meaningful improvement in overall conversion despite the unfavorable mix shift between the migration to mobile.", "To build on our momentum in digital, we have recently launched a new ad campaign focused on millennials that aims to expand the brand perception of Target from a brick-and-mortar destination to a total retailer experience. The campaign features three of our most prominent omni-channel initiatives, subscriptions, store pickup and Cartwheel. Market research indicates that these three solutions are among the most important to guests, because they help them save time, save money, and stay organized.", "This year\u2019s back-to-college assortment includes a set of unique own brand items that our own product design and development team developed in partnership with college students based on the challenges they faced when living with roommates in very small spaces. And since we are already planning for back-to-college 2015, we have recently partnered with Betterific, an open crowd sourcing community focused on innovation to help us think of other innovative products that could make life in a first apartment or dorm room even better. The community proposed hundreds of ideas. Then together Target and the community built on each other\u2019s ideas and voted on the best ones. Now, our team is using the ideas to identify unmet guest needs, determine if there are products that we can bring to market for back-to-college next year and uncover completely new industry-first products. Betterific is part of Target\u2019s larger guest-to-guest initiative that is working to connect guests to each other and to Target in meaningful ways.", "Our first TargetExpress store opened in late July here in the Twin Cities right next to the University of Minnesota campus. This store looks great and we are excited about the insights we will gain from operating this new format over time. At approximately 20,000 square feet, 15% of a typical general merchandise store, TargetExpress is designed, so guests can get what they need and get out quickly. So far sales at the store have come in as expected and not surprisingly we are seeing much more traffic and a much smaller basket than our chain wide average.", "Also as expected, sales have been heavy in food and essentials with the mix of own brand sales in those categories far outpacing the chain average. We are also seeing strong sales in mobile electronics, including accessories and in our fan central area, where we feature University of Minnesota clothing. We plan to expand our test of this new format to several additional locations outside the Twin Cities next year.", "Cartwheel just celebrated its first birthday and we celebrated with the crowd sourced Cartwheel offer, a first for Target for a special limited time discount. The winning offer generated a high level of engagement during the promotion period more than doubling the typical rate of new users and activations. Also in July, we launched a proof-of-concept to integrate Target.com into Cartwheel with the goal of making it simple for guests to shop with Cartwheel across channels. In this test, guests can see online eligible offers in their Cartwheel app and are directed to the Target.com mobile website to add them to their Target.com cart. After testing these initial deals, we will expand the number of offers and we will begin promoting the functionality when the testing period is complete.", "In June, we meaningfully simplified the Target.com shopping experience by rolling out free shipping on all orders over $50. We made this change because the research shows that the number one cause of abandoned carts is a surprise at checkout, including uncertain shipping charges. Since we made this change, we have already seen measurable improvements in digital conversion rates and sales. Of course, I should mention that Target card guests continue to receive free shipping on every order everyday.", "In late July, for the first time, we ran a promotion on our store pickup program with the goal of raising awareness of the service, while testing systems and processes before the fourth quarter peak. The guest response to the offer was far ahead of our expectations at five times the volume of a regular week with a particularly strong response in mobile. The offer attracted many guests to use store pickup for the first time and some are even new to Target.com. Importantly, about one-fifth of those guests engaged in additional shopping in-store when they picked up their online purchases.", "We are pleased with continued strong growth in the number of guests spending up for Target subscriptions. Among the nearly 4,000 eligible items, subscription orders account for more than 15% of digital sales. In the back half of 2014, we are focused on enhancing the guest experience, including continued assortment expansion, consolidating shipments, simplifying communication and rightsizing packaging. We are also developing an optimized mobile experience and moving to test in-store acquisition via mobile devices and we are exploring gifting subscriptions, which would allow guests to register for subscriptions that are easy for gift givers to fulfill.", "We are pleased with results from our second quarter test of ship from store capability in the Boston, Miami and Minneapolis markets. As part of the test, some guests were offered the option of a $10 service to get same day delivery on Target.com orders placed before 1:30 PM. In the three test markets, the ability to leverage our stores crossover inventory has allowed us to capture more sales by meaningfully improving digital in-stocks. In addition, shipping from a store dramatically reduces shipping times without the need to rely on air freight. This fall when we rollout standard ship from store capabilities to 35 additional markets, we will be within 1 to 2-day ground transit of 91% of the U.S. population.", "In Canada, second quarter sales accelerated meaningfully from the first quarter but fell somewhat short of our expectations. Gross margin was also lower than expected driven by elevated markdowns resulting from continued operational issues. As I mentioned earlier, the Target Canada team is engaged in a comprehensive review of strategy and operations, which incorporates feedback from guests, teams and business partners and the team is taking decisive steps to address our guest concerns head-on, including changes to address in-stocks, pricing and assortment. To address in-stocks, the team is taking action on four dimensions, better reporting to identify in-stock issues sooner, retraining our teams on best methods, developing new best methods tailored to Canadian segment systems and reconfiguring systems to work more effectively over the long run.", "On pricing, while both our own studies and external surveys show that we are already priced very competitively, the team has made decisive changes to ensure we respond even more quickly to pricing dynamics in the Canadian marketplace, including comparison shopping our prices versus competitors on more items more frequently, implementing enhanced tracking of competitor promotions to ensure we react quickly, and implementing a price match policy, which includes online and local competition with a more flexible process for guests.", "Regarding the Canadian assortment, we are adding product lines that our guests told us were missing from our everyday lineup. We are adding more newness to our stores and we are adding more exclusive items and designer partnerships what we are known for in both the U.S. and Canada. Putting all these changes together means that of the 70,000 items in a typical Canadian Target store, about 30,000 items will be new between now and the holiday season. We believe these changes will position the Canadian segment for improved performance in time for this holiday season and the Canada leadership team will look for additional opportunities as they continue their review.", "As we look ahead to the third quarter and beyond, we are excited about our plans to introduce new products, partnerships and capabilities in our stores and digital channels. We have been very pleased with early results from the back-to-school season, including the response to buy one, give one offers on our own up and up supplies, along with our exclusive line of colorful notebooks, pens and rulers from UB. Like our back-to-college assortment, many up and up back-to-college products were developed by our own design team in partnership with students and teachers who tested them and gave us report cards on how they could be improved. The guest response to the up and up school assortment has been phenomenal. Last year, comp sales in up and up school supplies were up more than 25% during the back-to-school season and we are planning another healthy increase this year.", "Our back-to-college assortment highlights mix and match options for guys and gals to outfit their entire dorm in a stylish and affordable way. Some of our guest favorites are space saving, multiuse items like a storage mirror, a task lamp with iPhone and iPad storage, multifunctional and collapsible tables and desks, and innovative storage solutions designed to go over the bed or chair to hold laptops and mobile phones. This year\u2019s addition of registry capability for college students has been outpacing expectations. On average, a student registers for 30 items totaling more than $1,000.", "We are excited about our upcoming designer partnership, Altuzarra for Target, which will arrive on September 14. Designer and creative director, Joseph Altuzarra created a limited edition fall collection of women\u2019s ready-to-wear lingerie, accessories, and shoes, which will be available at most Target stores in the U.S. and Canada as well as Target.com. In addition, an edited assortment of the collection will be available globally at Net-A-Porter.com.", "In May 2013, Target entered into a partnership with Sam & Libby and it\u2019s been a huge hit with our guests who love classic styles like the original leather boat ballet at an unexpected value of $30. In September, we will be extending our Sam & Libby assortment with the launch of the exclusive Sam & Libby handbag line in over 1,000 stores throughout the U.S., with two fall collections featuring 20 styles in stores as an extended assortment on Target.com.", "In women\u2019s apparel, the fall assortment will reflect the number one current trend we call neo-traditional with feminine menswear inspired looks in plaids and florals. This look will be most visible in Merona with hints in of our Xhilaration and Mossimo Supply Company lines. After rapid growth in 2013, we are expecting another big increase this fall in women\u2019s boots, including riding boots from Merona and lace-up ankle boots from Mossimo Supply Company.", "Another hot trend is sport and this fall we will be riding the leisure trend in our juniors\u2019 assortment with leggings, sweatshirts, yoga pants, joggers and fashion athletic shoes. In denim, a huge category for back-to-college, we just launched a new improved shopping experience for our guests with improved navigation, new fits, a broader range of sizes, more stretch, and the most relevant washes and styling, all highlighted through compelling promotions.", "In threshold, the fall season is all about natural materials, beautiful textures and warm metallics. With key solutions in entertaining, like our warm metallic bar cart, accessories, glassware and flatware and decorative items like lanterns, throws, toss pillows and perfect accent tables. In July, Target launched S Sport designed by Skechers partnering with one of the hottest footwear brands in the industry today. The S Sport label is a lifestyle brand targeted to appeal to the entire family with offerings in kids, men\u2019s and women\u2019s. The initial response has been overwhelming and we have seen styles performing at 4 to 8 times the average of our shoe category. S Sport shoes for men, women and children are available at all U.S. and Canadian stores and at Target.com ranging in price from $25 to $40.", "In housewares in September, we will be featuring new products from some of the hottest national brands and small appliances with the introduction of the VertuoLine from Nespresso, single-serve blenders from Vitamix, and the new Keurig 2.0 line. In June, Target teamed up with the Honest Company to offer guests non-toxic eco-friendly products by co-designers, Jessica Alba and Christopher Gavigan featuring diapers, biodegradable wipes, organic bath and skincare and an expanded assortment on Target.com.", "Based on the success of the collaboration, we recently expanded our Honest Company assortment to include a line of all-natural cleaning supplies. Like Honest Company, our Made to Matter collection was inspired by our guest desire for better for you natural and organic products. This unique collection differentiates Target in the marketplace and provides vendor partners a stage to innovate in support of their leadership positions in respective categories. The collection launched in April with an initial set of items and the guest response has been outstanding. So, we are excited about the upcoming launch in September of an expanded assortment of more than 100 Made to Matter products, including exclusive new to market items from Method, Seventh Generation and many others.", "At CHEFS Catalog, which just celebrated its 35th anniversary, we are excited about our upcoming October collaboration with CHEFS and longtime host of Bizarre Foods, Andrew Zimmern. The partnership includes several products, which melds the design elements of Japanese, Chinese and French cutlery into items Andrew describes as one knife fits all pieces of kitchen magic. The collaboration also features spice blends with names like Flex Your Mex, Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, or Grill Buddy.", "For Halloween, we are excited to be partnering once again with designer Chris March to offer a whimsical wig and accessory collection. This unique assortment reinforces both sides of our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise, with wigs that look like curlers or lobsters and the core items from candy bowls to hand towels, all priced at $20 or less. The collection available exclusively at Target stores in the U.S. and Canada and at Target.com will launch mid-September online and later that month in our stores.", "In Canada, we just announced that we have extended our very successful beaver canoe collaboration with an expansion of home decor items, along with men\u2019s and women\u2019s sleepwear and slippers. Also in Canada, on September 7, we will be launching two new lines of cleaning products, Better Life, an all-natural line of cleaning products designed by two fathers with charismatic packaging designed to speak to younger generations and Ecover, a European brand recently merged with Method, which will re-launch with better formulations and modernized packaging.", "Increasingly, consumers expect everything they do to be personalized and this is particularly true of millennials, Target\u2019s fastest growing guest segment. For the last six months, Target.com has been building an engine that will enable personalization across all of Target\u2019s selling channels. Personalized product recommendations, the first iteration of this work will launch this fall at Target.com. When a guest shops our site, we will suggest products based on their store and digital purchase and browse history. This presents a significant opportunity to ensure guests see the products and offers most relevant to them both in-store and online and in turn generate additional sales.", "We will continue improving the guest experience and we are working to extend the personalization to more guest experiences, including product content and offers in the future. We also continue to add mobile enhancements to drive additional traffic and conversion. Just today, we launched a new header to enhance navigation and the mobile landing page and we are streamlining mobile checkout to two clicks.", "Also this year, we are overhauling our registry service with the new best-in-class experience that combines the power of online and mobile shopping together with in-store tools like new web-enabled smart scanners and iPad kiosks. Registry is already important for Target and the new experience puts us at the forefront of the industry by making the entire process easier, smarter and faster. Improvements include faster scanning and adding of products, easy addition of companion products, full product information, access to reviews and inspiration through collections and lists. And in our stores, we are pleased with results from our efforts to refresh the shopping experience in key categories, including baby, apparel and beauty.", "In July, we added another 167 stores with the enhanced baby layout bringing the total number to more than 200. In apparel, we have about 50 stores today with an enhanced presentation, including manikins, and we are planning to expand this layout to another 600 stores by October. And in beauty, we continue to see strong results from this year\u2019s refresh of displays throughout the U.S. while featuring beauty concierge service in more than 400 stores. We are excited with our plans for the fall and believe we are taking the right steps to improve results in both the U.S. and Canada and we are encouraged that based on the changes we are making we have seen positive comps over the last six weeks in the U.S. We are working hard to ensure that teams in both countries are focused on execution during the upcoming holiday season and we look forward to working with Brian to map our vision for Target\u2019s future.", "Now, I will turn it over to John who will share his insights on the second quarter financial performance and our third quarter and full year outlook. John?", "John Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kathee. As I mentioned in today\u2019s press release, we are not satisfied with our second quarter results, but we are seeing early signs of progress. In the U.S., our second quarter traffic was notably better than the first quarter pace, enough to improve the traffic trends on a two-year basis. However, the level of second quarter promotions in the U.S. remained elevated.", "And looking ahead, we are working to moderate our promotional intensity to a level we believe is more appropriate in the long run. We are encouraged with the recently improved U.S. comparable sales trend. In particular, because our promotional intensity over this period was not as elevated as earlier in the year. In Canada, the team has been working hard to assess root causes for underperformance and implement changes to improve operations and the product assortment with the focus on improving results in time for the holiday season. However, we want to be clear that current financial performance in Canada remains unacceptable.", "Our second quarter comp in the U.S. segment was flat largely in line with our guidance. As Kathee mentioned, digital sales, including flexible fulfillment, grew more than 30% compared with last year contributing about 60 basis points to comparable sales. While this demonstrates meaningful progress on our omni-channel journey, we will continue to invest in digital capabilities as the importance of this channel continues to grow.", "Our second quarter U.S. segment EBITDA margin was lower than expected, about 80 basis points below last year driven by a lower than expected gross margin rate partially offset by better than expected SG&A expenses. Specifically, the U.S. segment gross margin rate was down about 100 basis points from last year somewhat better than our first quarter experience, but not where we expect to perform over the longer term. The U.S. segment\u2019s second quarter SG&A rate improved about 20 basis points versus last year, reflecting impressive discipline across the organization combined with the benefit of our expense optimization efforts.", "In the U.S., second quarter sales penetration on REDcards was 28.8%, up more than two percentage points over last year. As I mentioned on the last call, we have seen a slower trend in debit card applications since the data breach, which is leading to slower growth in sales penetration. We have taken steps to reaccelerate growth in REDcard applications, including increased activity in our stores and we have begun to see improvement in REDcard issuance as a result, particularly in the last few weeks. However, given there is a lagged impact of applications on penetration, we expect penetration growth will continue to moderate in the third and fourth quarter, reflecting the slowdown in new REDcard accounts we have seen so far this year. Specifically, our current expectation is that U.S. REDcard penetration growth will be in the range of flat to up 1% in the third quarter and will reach a trough at around flat in the fourth quarter before reaccelerating into next year.", "In the Canadian segment, second quarter sales were 63% higher than last year and about 14% above for the first quarter. For the first time, we began reporting comparable sales in Canada this quarter as 48 stores became mature at various points within the quarter. However, this metric is expected to be very noisy initially due to the strong and longer than normal grand opening sales surges we saw last year and the fact that we densified around these initial openers later in 2013. As a result, this quarter the Canadian comp was down more than 11%, reflecting these impacts and less than adequate progress in our efforts to grow sales in these stores.", "On our Canadian sales, we are under gross margin rate of just over 18% in the second quarter, well below where we should operate in the long run. Both sales and gross margin rate continued to reflect operations that are not working optimally resulting in lumpy inventory. We continue to see inconsistent in-stock levels by item and location and we have excess inventory overall leading to elevated levels of clearance markdowns. This is why the Canadian leadership team has put its highest priority on implementing system and process changes designed to improve operations with the goal of improving performance in time for the holiday season.", "And as Kathee outlined, the team is already making a host of changes based on findings from our operational review. Second quarter Canadian segment expense rates were better than last year, reflecting the startup nature of results a year ago. However, these rates will remain elevated until we gain more scale in this segment. REDcard penetration in Canada was 4.8% in the second quarter, more than double last year\u2019s 2.3% as Canadian guests continue to respond to the value these cards provide. We expect to continue to see robust growth in penetration for quite sometime.", "Beyond the operating results in the U.S. and Canada, our second quarter GAAP EPS reflected the impact of several items, not included in adjusted EPS. The largest adjustment was a $0.27 per share charge for the accounting loss associated with our second quarter early debt retirement. We funded this retirement along with a $1 billion maturity with the issuance of $2 billion of debt at very favorable rates in the quarter. Not reflected in this accounting loss is the fact that the early debt retirement has a positive net present value. Also in the quarter, we recognized data breach expenses of $148 million partially offset by the recognition of a $38 million insurance receivable.", "In addition to legal, consulting and administrative fees, second quarter breach expenses included an additional accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by payment card networks for fraud and administrative costs. This means that in total over the last few quarters, we have recognized an accumulated $236 million of gross expenses related to the breach offset by a $90 million insurance receivable for a net of $146 million. This number is dramatically lower than many external estimates at the time of the breach and it reflects the benefits of our efforts to rapidly notify both card networks and our guests when we learned of the breach enhancing the effectiveness of fraud prevention and detection.", "Looking ahead, we will continue to incur legal, consulting and administrative costs related to the breach, but we don\u2019t expect those costs to be material in any period. And of course, it will take more time to resolve all breach-related claims. And while we don\u2019t believe it is probable, it is possible that we could incur material losses beyond the amounts we have already accrued. Beyond these two larger adjustments in the second quarter, we also recognized $0.01 each related to the impairment of some undeveloped land and the continued reduction in the beneficial interest asset associated with last year\u2019s credit card portfolio sales.", "Turning to the consolidated metrics, second quarter interest expense was $282 million higher than last year due entirely to the loss on early debt retirement I covered earlier. We also paid $272 million in dividends this quarter, up 18% from $231 million last year. As expected, the Board approved a quarterly dividend increase during the quarter raising a 21% from $0.43 to $0.52. This increase builds on our company\u2019s track record of annual dividend increases, which have occurred every year since 1971.", "Beyond the non-cash share settlement forward contracts related to our deferred compensation plans, we did not engage in any share repurchase in the second quarter and we don\u2019t expect to do so in the third quarter as well. While we continue to expect to return robust amounts of cash to share repurchase over time, our business performance is not where it needs to be to sustain our middle A credit ratings. As I have said previously, to resume share repurchase, two things need to happen. First, we need to have sufficient visibility into our potential liability for claims related to the data breach and second, we need to see sufficient improvement in our U.S. and Canadian operations to create a clear path for our credit metrics to return to acceptable levels in support of our single A rating. While this quarter\u2019s recognition of an additional breach related accrual reflects progress on the first condition, our current and expected operating performance does not meet the second. As a result, we expect to continue to suspend cash investments in share purchase until operating performance improves.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full year. As I mentioned last quarter, in light of the environment and our performance so far this year, we will continue to maintain a cautious outlook for sales in both segments allowing us to plan inventory and expenses flexibly while maintaining contingency plans to flex higher when sales grow faster than expected. One note, consistent with guidance last quarter, our outlook does not include potential additional costs related to the data breach beyond what we have already recognized as they are not estimable.", "With that, let\u2019s turn to our third quarter expectations. We are currently forecasting U.S. comparable sales will be flat to up 1% this quarter. And as Kathee mentioned, we are encouraged by the positive comps we have seen so far in August. On our sales, we expect to see an EBITDA margin rate of 8% or a bit better. This rate reflects continued expected pressure on the gross margin line, but we expect about half the pressure we experienced in the second quarter. Consistent with earlier in the year, our third quarter EBITDA performance will benefit from our ongoing expense optimization efforts.", "In Canada, we expect sales growth of more than 50% above last year and more than 10% from the second quarter. This growth would lead to an expected positive single-digit comparable sales growth rate. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates are expected to improve compared with last year and be in line with or slightly better than the rates we saw in the second quarter. Altogether, these expectations would improve third quarter Canadian segment EBITDA by approximately $25 million compared with last year.", "We expect third quarter consolidated interest expense to be approximately flat for last year and tax expense to be somewhat lower. Altogether, these expectations would generate adjusted EPS, reflecting results from both our U.S. and Canadian operations of $0.40 to $0.50, excluding $0.02 related to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential cost related to the data breach, which are not expected to be material.", "For the full year, we now expect U.S. comparable sales in the range of flat to up 1%. In the U.S., we continue to expect an SG&A expense rate of about 20% for the full year and a gross margin rate between 29% and 30%. These expectations reflect year-to-date results along with anticipated year-over-year favorability in fourth quarter gross margin and SG&A expense rates as we annualized the impacts of the data breach in fourth quarter 2013.", "In our Canadian segment, we continue to expect full year sales of about $2 billion. However, given our recent experience and moderated expectations for gross margin in the near-term, we now expect an EBITDA margin rate near minus 25% for the full year. Altogether, these updated expectations would put our full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 below the range we provided a quarter ago. These expected results are clearly not where we expect to perform over time. Over the last 90 days, Kathee and I have worked with a leadership team to take visible steps to continue healing our U.S. business by removing unnecessary bureaucracy to speed up decision-making, devoting resources to drive increased newness and innovation in our merchandise assortments and store presentation, and investing in our digital transformation.", "While there is a lot more work to do, I am encouraged with our quarter-over-quarter improvement in U.S. traffic and our sales experience so far in July and August, particularly because this improvement has not been driven by intense promotions. In Canada, Mark and the team are making meaningful changes to operations, pricing and assortment as they focus on improving performance in the upcoming holiday season.", "Finally, as Brian mentioned earlier, over the last three months, partnership with Interim Chair, Roxanne Austin. The leadership team has conducted an in-depth review of our strategy, our brand, our guest and our capabilities in both the U.S. and Canada. Since Brian arrived, we have spent a great deal of time with him sharing insights from this review. And we believe this work will provide the foundation from which we can build a longer term vision for our strategy and financial model. We are so excited to welcome Brian to the team and committed to working with him to move this company forward. And like Brian, we believe the best days for Target lie ahead.", "With that, we will conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now, Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Good morning, Brian and everyone. Brian, I had a question for you and then one for Kathee, when you arrived, the role of President was left open. And I was curious whether or not you anticipate filling that role and any organizational structures that you might contemplate to speed the company to getting to market? And then Kathee, if you could just peel back the onion around why the UPT was down 1.7%, you made good progress in transactions, but you took a step back in UPT. And I am just wondering why and what you expect for those metrics into the third and fourth quarter? Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Wayne, let me start by answering your first question. My focus right now is to really understand the business in both the U.S. and Canada and I am spending a lot of time with John and Kathee and the team to understand the guest perspective on Target, how we improve our traffic, how we enhance our performance in Canada, and how we continue to build-out and rapidly build-out our omni-channel capabilities. So, I am very focused on making sure that we are going to make progress against those key three initiatives as I continue to look at the broader and longer term strategic options. So, my focus is really understanding the business today and strategy before we have any discussions around organization modifications going forward.", "Kathee Tesija", "And then Wayne in terms of unit per transaction, most of that was driven by higher dollar items that we were selling, things in electronics and in entertainment, so you see the healthy selling prices you mentioned, but fewer units. On the other portion of that, that I would say is that we are seeing really good momentum in our trade-up strategies. So, we are selling in some cases fewer units, but higher price points in other categories across the company, but it\u2019s predominantly electronics and entertainment.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of David Strasser with Janney. Please go ahead.", "David Strasser - Janney", "Thank you very much. I just wanted to step back a little bit and look you talked about even gross margins for this year to 29% to 30% range is a pretty wide range. And as you think about a world, an e-commerce world and how things are changing fairly rapidly out there. I am just trying to get a sense if you think over time that the gross margins are within that range, lower end of that range and sort of how you are thinking about that competitive landscape. I mean, you talked a lot about a lot of new merchandising initiatives and stuff, which can help offset some of that, but at the same time as every company that we have seen kind of get more focused and driven around e-commerce seems to see their gross margins lower by the nature of what that business is. So, I would love to hear a little bit about your thought process there? Thank you.", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes, David, there is no doubt with e-commerce being as immature as it is. There is some pressure on gross margin. We are committed to going where our guests go and they want to be able to shop online and we are going to make sure that we have got all the right products for them both online and in our stores. So that does give us a little headwind on the gross margin, but as you pointed out, all of the newness that we are bringing in, the things that our guests love most about Target that helps to offset it. So, we don\u2019t have a number to share with you today, but we are very focused on driving sales, going where the guest is and offering them those products that delight them.", "David Strasser - Janney", "So, I mean, I guess just as a follow-up to that, I mean, if the guest does go more rapidly towards .com, are you willing to accept lower gross margins to do that? And then just I guess sort of a related question to that too as you know, you talked about opening stores for greater hours, is there an SG&A investment as well that would be related to e-com \u2013 aside from just the build-out of e-commerce that you think that you need to add to the stores once again as this world is shifting? Thank you very much.", "John Mulligan", "On the gross margin rate, I think Kathee said it really well. We are going to go where the guest is and meet them, provide the product they want, where they want it, when they want it, how they want it, but there is a lot of tools in our toolkit to manage gross margin rate. There is certainly the product that Kathee talked about emphasizing the style categories with newness and differentiation. Beyond that there is the flexible fulfillment options, where we lowered shipping expense by moving the product closer to our guests and also ultimately balancing inventories better across the entire network and reducing markdowns that we incur today. So, there are lots of puts and takes. And like Kathee said, we don\u2019t have it all sorted out today. We will provide more information as we do, but I think there are lots of puts and takes as we think about gross margin rate more broadly.", "On the store, hourly payroll, first on the extended hours, the investment there was immaterial to the quarter. Again, that was about half the stores adding one hour of operation, so not significant investment there, but with Tina Schiel, our Head of Stores, we continually talk about ensuring that we are striking the right balance between productivity in those stores and we are having great guest service results. And what we see today, our guest surveys, of course, are as high as they have ever been and the team continues to drive really strong expense control. So, we feel good about where we are today, but we constantly evaluate that.", "David Strasser - Janney", "Thank you very much. I appreciate the answers.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot. Good morning. Brian, I would like to start out by asking you for your long-term perspective of threshold for Canada is related to time and financial performance, obviously that business today is performing at a materially lower level than was originally conceived when it was opened and presumably well below it\u2019s cost of capital. What would you want to see over time to keep that business running and what kind of timeframe do you have in mind for a same material improvement in that business?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. Well, Matthew as I mentioned earlier, I spent time just last week with the Canadian team and I am certainly aware that the expansion has been challenging. And from a Target standpoint, we have disappointed many of our Canadian guests. And Kathee has already referenced the fact that we are conducting an in-depth evaluation of our Canadian business that began several months ago. And we are certainly looking to make material improvements in that business. Right now, short-term, the focus is on improving in-stock conditions, our pricing and assortment and really ensuring that we have got plans in place to improve our performance in the holiday upcoming. So, you can expect me to be spending quite a bit of time with the Canadian team along with Kathee to make sure we understand the opportunities, we understand the challenges that we have to address, and we are focused on improving in-stocks, our value position, and an assortment as we go forward. So, I am going to spend clearly the balance of the year working very closely with that team to make sure we have got plans in place to improve performance as we go into the holiday season.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up on the U.S. business in the market for buy online, pickup in stores more mature, how additive do you find that is either to online sales or to the business overall? I know that for some retailers, it can be as much as 30% or 40% of the overall online sales number. So, where you have seen \u2013 where you have the most track record behind if you will what\u2019s your sense of how additive that can be?", "Kathee Tesija", "Well, we did add it to the chain all at the same time. So, we don\u2019t have any markets that are more mature. We did do a little testing with the team members in Minneapolis before we rolled that, but basically we rolled it all around November 1 of last year to all stores. And we have been very pleased with the results from buy online, pickup in store and about 14% of our digital sales today are being picked up in-store and then when they go to store to pickup those orders, we are seeing about 20% of those guests shop in the store to pickup additional items and there is a very healthy basket with that as well, so still early, but very, very promising. We think it saves guest time, it saves them money, and it allows them to consolidate their shopping.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for that clarity.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Hi, thanks. John, I want to follow-up a bit on the gross margins down 100 bps in the quarter, if I remember correctly, you had a goal for $600 million of cost reduction this year, roughly a third of it in cost of goods sold. Could you give us an update as to where we are on that and how much that may have helped the quarter in terms of U.S. margins?", "John Mulligan", "Yes, sure. You are right. It was \u2013 the goal for expense optimization about $650 million incremental to last year, which gets us to $850 million in total. Of the $650 million this year, just rough numbers, about $200 million of that was on the gross margin line coming out of cost of goods, more of that back-weighted than front-weighted. We are probably about a little bit more than a third of the way through that, probably a little bit more than that, maybe half of the way through that. So, there was definitely some benefit in the quarter from expense optimization. That was also true in the first quarter. Both quarters have benefited, but later in the year, we will see more benefit as we continue to grow those savings.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "And the same with the SG&A out of that $650 million, it\u2019s more back end?", "John Mulligan", "Yes, it builds as the year goes on. We are annualizing on the roughly $200 million we saved last year. That was primarily SG&A. So, there is probably a little bit more good news in SG&A right now, but that will continue to build as well as we go throughout the year.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Great. And if I could Brian, thanks a lot and welcome back to retail.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you, Greg.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "For your opening comments, how long do you think it will take for you to sort of get to understand the business in the customers and actually come up with a plan, is it something we should expect by year end or early next year or can you give us any time horizon on that?", "Brian Cornell", "Well, Greg, I am going to quickly immerse myself in the details of the business, both here in the U.S. and Canada. And John and Kathee and the leadership team have already spent hours with me walking through a lot of the strategic work that they have been doing over the last 90 days. As I said earlier, during my very first week, I visited the Canadian market to spend time with that team. And I want to be a good student of the business, but clearly we have to have a sense of urgency here and a sense of pace. And while I want to study the business and certainly and listen and learn from our team, no one is happy with our current performance. And our focus right now is to make sure we have got plans in place in the short-term to improve traffic, we have got plans in place to improve our performance in Canada, and we have got to continue to move faster from a digital and mobile standpoint to meet the needs of our guest. So, you can expect a clear sense of urgency, but I certainly want to make sure I give myself the time to listen, learn, understand, the business both from our team standpoint, but also from the eyes of the target guest. And you can expect me to dive in very quickly to understand the business, to look for the opportunities and to work with the leadership team to develop very focused priorities as we go forward into 2015 and beyond.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Thanks a lot.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks a lot and good morning. I was hoping to get some more detail on the improved performance in July and August. And I am wondering if you have a sense from your guest surveys, how much of that change is driven by price investments efforts to improve the presentation or it maybe a change in the broader environment?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes. Matt, I think it\u2019s more about product and the newness that we have on the floor. For back-to-school, back-to-college, we have seen both of those start off really strong. Even in their peak weeks, those stores are doing better that week after their peak. So, we are seeing it stronger in the peak and then get even stronger after that. So, I think it\u2019s really product-related and newness. Certainly, we have had promotions. Most of them are devoted to those core categories like apparel, some of the back-to-college items, but the guest right now is more focused on the occasion than they are under the promotion. So, that is very encouraging to us and I think its product driven.", "Brian Cornell", "Matt, if I could just early days, but the current performance on back-to-school and the way Kathee and the team, have put back-to-school together at Target has been very impressive to me. And I think it\u2019s a great example of getting the product right, the right balance of newness and innovation, great advertising communication that really captures the guest attention and very strong in-store and online execution. So, I think that\u2019s one of the great examples that we are going to continue to build from as we go forward, but I think Kathee and the entire team have brought back-to-school to life, back-to-college to life with the right products, the right newness and innovation, great advertising communication to support it, and then very strong in-store and online execution.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "That\u2019s very helpful. And then one housekeeping follow-up if I may, your Canada comp transactions were only down about 2%, which frankly was a little bit surprising against the grand opening halo, I am wondering why UPT was down so much, I think it was down over 8%?", "John Mulligan", "UPT down 8% in Canada, Matt, I think a lot of that \u2013 what I would tell you is a lot of noise going on in the Canada comp overall. So much of the surge last year we saw very different types of transactions, then we saw once we moved past that as we opened stores, we saw that in each cycle, very different behavior for those I don\u2019t know four to six weeks when we had the surge period. And then as the business settled down and got into a more normal state, we saw more routine transaction counts and baskets. What I would tell you is we are going to continue to see this. It\u2019s going to be noisy in Q3. And really it won\u2019t be till we get to Q4 when we have cycled past all the opening cycles, all the densification that we get a real read on what\u2019s going on, on a comparable basis from the business year-over-year.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, thanks so much and good luck.", "John Mulligan", "Thanks.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matt McClintock - Barclays", "Hi, yes, good morning and welcome Brian.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Matt.", "Matt McClintock - Barclays", "Kathee, my question was actually for you, you talk a lot about product freshness and newness and I was just wondering as you look to the fall merchandise plan, how far can you push freshness and newness into that plan? What inning would you say that represents overall relative to what you consider to be more optimal level and when can we realistically expect you to reach that more optimal level? Thank you.", "Kathee Tesija", "Well, haven\u2019t thought about it in terms of innings, Matt, but we are excited about what we have coming for the fall season. I highlighted a lot of things that are coming in September and October, but then moving on to the fourth quarter, which we won\u2019t be specific about today, but we are excited about what that brings as well. We have about 85,000 items in our assortment and we will have 35,000 new items this fall season. So, I do feel pretty optimistic about the contents, the quality, the trend, the presentation, but clearly, in spring I think you will see that will be a full cycle out and we will have much more to come as we turned the corner into the spring season.", "Matt McClintock - Barclays", "Thank you.", "John Hulbert", "Matt, thank you. Operator, I think we have got time for one last question.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Good morning and welcome Brian. Quick one for Kathee, we talked in New York about a month ago about traffic trips and I understand we are still intact from the customer, but you had lost 1 out of 10 and that maybe e-commerce was the angle of you to get that back. My question is how confident and I don\u2019t know if you have any early indications from your own data that when that customer does shop online with you that either they are not going to visit the store less or that they will not maintain the same level of purchasing?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes. The guest that shops Target online is absolutely our best guest. They shop both online and in-stores. It\u2019s really all about what\u2019s convenient for them and sometimes it\u2019s just easier to knocking item off your list by buying it on your mobile device. Sometimes, you want to purchase it online by pick it up in store to do the rest, but this is absolutely our best guest and one we will not see. So, we will go after being a seamless omni-channel retailer with confidence knowing that it\u2019s the best thing for our guest and best thing for our business. And I do think that, that when we think about the last guest, they are basically backed and so traffic changes are more about consolidated trips and trips shifting online. So, it\u2019s an important part for us to own it, which is why you see all of the efforts in our omni-channel capabilities and strategies with subscriptions and with personalization and with ship from store and buy online, pickup in stores, there is a lot of things that we are putting effort into that will help drive that momentum.", "Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "John Hulbert - Senior Director, Investor Communications", "Right.

Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 19, 2014.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.", "This morning, Brian will discuss our third quarter performance and our priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Then Kathee will provide more detail on recent performance and outline our plans for the fourth quarter including the holiday season. And finally john will provide more detail on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his comments on the third quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John. And good morning to all of you. We are pleased with Target's third quarter financial performance which we announced earlier this morning.", "Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 was better than our guidance of $0.40 to $0.50. Driven by US segment comp sales growth of 1.2% which is also better than our expectations.", "Importantly the US segments saw positive comps in all three months of the quarter. And we are encouraged that the pace of US traffic continues to recover for a very challenging trend earlier in the year. While US traffic still declined slightly in the third quarter, performance was more than a full percentage point stronger than traffic trends through the first half of the year.", "As we mentioned in our second quarter earning call, we saw a strong start to back-to-school and to the back-to-college season and that strength continued in September. Like many others, our sales slowed as we entered October, but recovered nicely towards the end of the month as we approached Halloween.", "While our Canadian segment continues to see robust year-over-year growth, third quarter sales in Canada fell short of our expectations. As Kathee outlined in our last earnings call, the team in Canada has been working diligently to make improvements to operations, assortment, and pricing, in preparation for the fourth quarter.", "With these changes we believe we are better positioned to serve our guests at a time of the year when traffic will naturally be higher. The guest response to these changes both in their shopping behavior and overall sentiment towards Target will inform our perspective as we continue to assess our longer-term potential in Canada.", "As I visited stores across the US and Canada, and worked with the Target team, I have been continually impressed with the level of their talent and passion to perform.", "As the leadership team has begun, our work to develop Target's longer term goals, we have aligned around five key operating principles. First, we will provide strategic clarity to the team. Second, we will articulate what Target stands for in today's retail marketplace. Third, we will thoughtfully prioritize what we do applying discipline to ensure we are focused on work that adds the most long-term value. Fourth, we will invest resources, and build capabilities to support our priorities so the team is equipped to deliver on these goals. And finally we will foster a culture of accountability at all levels of the organization.", "While our work to define Target's longer-term vision is not yet complete, we've made significant progress in defining the short and longer term priorities for our business. First, omni-channel and flexible fulfillment capabilities are key to our long-term success.", "Target's digital sales are growing much faster than the industry and they have been accelerating all year and we are planning for even faster growth in the fourth quarter. But our omni-channel journey is just beginning. As we plan for the future, we will take a channel-agnostic view of our growth allowing our guests to interact with us where and when they want, online, in stores and on their mobile device. And because an increasing number of Target visits begin on a digital platform, we will continue to push ourselves to innovate and build capabilities and features into our digital experience that will inspire guests while removing friction from their daily lives.", "Second, we are defining how we will strategically segment our categories and increase our focus on signature categories we can and should be known for. Categories like baby, kids, wellness and style.", "Over time we will work to grow these areas more quickly by investing a higher share of our resources including capital, marketing and product development. Importantly this view of segmentation doesn't mean we are abandoning our other categories. Let me restate this. It does not mean we are abandoning our other categories. But we will have different expectation for those categories compared to the ones in which we are investing to outperform.", "For example, we believe we should continue to present a meaningful food offering in our stores and online. But we need to ensure that our food offering is uniquely Target and clearly differentiated from our competitors.", "Looking ahead, we know our identity and food will continue to involve a combination of national brands and our own and exclusive brands with increased emphasis on natural and better-for-you products.", "Third, we know that localization and personalization will be a key focus going forward. Fifteen years ago, all Target stores were virtually identical, and were focused on providing consistent assortment, and experience across the country. In today's world we need to continue to maintain our brand standards across every store. But our guests expect each of our stores to reflect the local communities in which they operate.", "In the past we have taken some initial steps to localize our store environment and assortment. But we have only scratched the surface to this opportunity. Similarly, Target's digital experience will become increasingly personalized for every guest.", "This year we have developed and rolled out a new personalization engine which is currently generating product recommendations for guests on our digital platforms. Even though this new engine is in the beta rollout stage, conversion rate from its recommendations are already exceeding what we were previously seeing with the third party product.", "As we continue to make changes based on initial learning, we expect conversion rates will expand further overtime. Looking ahead we expect to leverage this engine's capability to provide customized experiences across our digital platforms.", "As we contemplate potential store growth, we believe that smaller formats present an exiting opportunity for Target, because urban consumers have such a high affinity for our brand. If we can reach more of these guests with small flexible formats like City Target and Target Express we can offer urban consumers greater convenience, unique merchandise and an outstanding value with extended assortment available at target.com.", "And finally as we plan for the future, we must focus on ways to responsibly control cost to help fuel investments in our growth. The team has made solid progress in expense optimization effort over the last few years, but we believe we must continue to find cost saving opportunities in the years to come.", "In the coming months, the leadership team will continue our work to fully math out longer-term aspiration for Target and we will communicate those plans to you early next year. In the near-term we are focused on strong execution our fourth quarter plans both the US and Canada. These plans are designed to embrace the core of our expect more, pay less brand promise inspiring our guest with unique products and experiences while providing unbeatable value to our low prices. Kathee will provide more detail in a few minutes.", "In Canada we are expecting much better fourth quarter performance than we experienced last year. But we know that to succeed in Canada we will need a major step change in performance. The fact is, given where we are performing today, we need to see improved financial performance from every Target store in Canada overtime. The team has worked hard to prepare for the Canadian operations for the fourth quarter. And we will be watching to see how those improvements connect with our guests during the holiday season.", "While there is much more work to be done, I am very pleased with the momentum we are seeing in the US business, and the changes we have implemented to better position our Canadian segment.", "My confidence in the potential of this company and this brand have only been reinforced in the last three months as I gain deeper knowledge of Target to my work with the team. I am committed to realize in the potential of this great American brand to the benefit of our guests, team, shareholders, and communities. And I believe we are taking the right first steps in that journey.", "Now I will turn the call over to Kathee for a recap of the third quarter performance and our plans for the holiday season. Kathee?", "Kathee Tesija", "", "Thanks, Brian. On our last conference call, we outlined that we had already seen a strong start to the third quarter driven by initial results in the back-to-school and back-to-college season. A key question at the time was whether this early strength would prove to be temporary resulting in a pullback later in the quarter. With the quarter now behind us, I am happy to report that we continue to outperform our US forecast throughout the quarter and saw positive US comps all three months. ", "As Brian mentioned earlier, third quarter US traffic was down slightly from a year ago but we are encouraged that our traffic trend has improved meaningfully every quarter this year. Consistent with year-to-date trends, average ticket increased 1.6% in the third quarter driven by growth in average retail per item, particularly partially offset by a decline in items per basket.", "At a category level in the US, third quarter comparable sales performance was strongest in healthcare and beauty led by beauty which continues to benefit from this year's store fixture innovations, and the introduction of new brands. Third quarter comps in home were up in the low single digits with particular strength in seasonal categories, benefiting from back-to-school, back-to-college sales early in the quarter and late quarter strength in Halloween.", "Third quarter comp sales in grocery were up in the low single digits, and hard lines was up slightly led by toys which saw a high single digit increase on strength in licenses like Frozen and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.", "Comp sales in apparel were down slightly as strength in baby and kids was offset by softness in jewelry accessories and intimates. From a mixed perspective it's worth noting that our combined home or combined comp in home and apparel was the strongest we have seen in two years.", "In October and early November, we completed the rollout of our new apparel fixtures and layout to an additional 600 stores bringing the total to about 650 locations featuring this enhanced presentation.", "Consistent with our expectations, the US third quarter gross margin rate was about 50 basis points lower than last year, about half the decline we saw in the second quarter. This reflects continued moderation of our promotional intensity which we intentionally moved higher in the wake of last December's data breach.", "Digital sales were up more than 30% in the third quarter and contributed about 60 basis points our US comparable sales growth. Consistent with the rest of the industry, all of our digital traffic growth is on our mobile platforms where third quarter traffic grew more than 50%. Conversion this quarter was up strongly on both the conventional site and on mobile compounding the benefit from the traffic growth.", "Following the success of our second quarter decision to offer free shipping on all target.com orders over $50, in October we announced that we are offering our guests free shipping on all orders this holiday season.", "Since this announcement, our guests have responded enthusiastically. We've seen a meaningful increase in both orders and conversion compared with trends prior to the announcement. Of course I would be remised if I didn't point out that REDcard holders continue to receive free shipping on all orders year round.", "In Canada, third quarter sales were up 44% from a year ago moderately below our expectations. Our third quarter gross margin rate of 19.5% was consistent with our expectations as we continue to clear excess inventory from earlier in the year.", "As Brian mentioned the team in Canada has been working diligently to improve operations, assortment and pricing and our internal measures show that we are making progress.", "However we are also measuring the impact these changes are having on Canadian consumer sentiment and that data is more mixed. We will continue to measure guest sentiment in the fourth quarter when all of our recent improvements will be fully in place and traffic will be naturally higher.", "As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and the holiday shopping season, we are excited about our plans to inspire our guests with unique products, outstanding deals and increased convenience provided by our flexible fulfillment efforts. On our digital platforms, we are coming into this holiday season with many more capabilities than we had a year ago. In fact it was about a year ago that we rolled out in-store pickup across all of our US stores. So far this year store pickup orders have averaged about 15% of digital traffic with more than 80% of orders ready within an hour.", "Based on last year's results, we expect in-store pickup orders will become a much higher share of digital traffic in the days leading up to Christmas as consumers increasingly value the certainty this service provides compared with the potential risk posed by weather related shipping delays. And we continue to explore potential enhancements to flexible fulfillment like our curbside test, pickup test in 10 San Francisco Bay Area stores and our same-day delivery test in Minneapolis, Boston and Miami.", "The Target app and Cartwheel are both top 10 retail apps, and we continue to innovate to maintain our leadership position in this space.", "In the third quarter we re-launched our mobile and tablet apps making it easier for guests to locate and purchase what they are looking for with interactive store maps and shopping lists, streamline checkout and the addition of Apple Pay for the iPhone app.", "Our new list function automatically notifies guests when an item is on sale or eligible for an offer on Cartwheel, and our new interactive store maps show item locations throughout each store. For our in-store Black Friday guests this year, special interactive maps will show door buster locations throughout each store.", "We completed a successful national-wide rollout of ship-from-store capability in October. With the rollout we are now shipping about 60,000 eligible products from 136 stores in 38 markets covering more than 90% of the US population. The ability to access stores inventory to fulfill online orders improves our digital in-stocks and drives incremental sales in situations where we are out of stock in our fulfillment centers. And while shipping from stores significantly lower shipping costs, most importantly it allows us to get items into guests' hands more quickly. This change is already being noticed.", "In the third quarter Internet Retailer reported a survey showing that we were leading our competitors with the fastest delivery having been near the back of the pack earlier in the year.", "We recently rolled out and improved omni-channel experience for our registries with new web-enabled smart scanners and a matching target.com user experience. The new smart scanners allow guests to add items more quickly to a registry and new features like collections and check lists provide inspiration and help guests build registries more quickly.", "Guests can add online-only items like specific colors or models right from the device in the store without having to edit online at home later. And companion and related products are suggested immediately when a guest adds an item to their registry. And when gift givers access a registry on our new in-store iPad kiosks, they can send gift list to their smart phones via SMS with saving time, reducing costs and eliminating waste from paper printouts.", "As we enter the holiday shopping season, we are featuring a dazzling array of unique and exclusive products and of course outstanding deals. In September we announced that Target would be partnering with TOMS on a limited edition holiday collection of home goods, apparel, accessories and shoes for women, men and children.", "Similar to TOMS' one-for-one giving model, for each item purchased, a donation will be made with the potential to provide more than 11 million meals, blankets and shoes to those in need. The collection rolled out at all Target stores in the US and Canada and on target.com on November 16th.", "We also recently announced our holiday collaboration with Faribault Woolen Mill. Founded in 1865 and located on the banks of the Cannon River in Faribault, Minnesota. This mill is part of American history having provided woolen blankets for pioneers headed west and for American troops in two world wars.", "On November 2nd, we rolled out a variety of American made giftable items from this iconic company featuring 100% wool scarves, throws, tote bags and tech accessories in four patterns available exclusively on target.com. If there's one thing we have learnt from our partnerships with Taylor Swift is that our guests can't get enough of Taylor and her music. Even though gifting season is yet to come, our Target exclusive deluxe edition of Taylor CD titled 1989 featuring three exclusive songs and voice memos that gives fans unique insight into her song writing process has already become our best-selling album of all time.", "Disney's Frozen has been huge for us all year, and is positioned to be one of the most popular licensed brands at Target this holiday season with 600 frozen products, 60 exclusive to Target across 20 categories.", "For the holidays we are partnering with Ren\u00e9e Ehrlich Kalfus, costume designer for the contemporized Annie film to offer guests a limited edition collection of kids' apparel and accessories inspired by the film. Annie for Target will be available through December 26th or while supplies last at all US Target stores and on target.com. The film debuts in theaters nationwide on December 19th.", "In beauty we continue to experience strong growth in natural products and we are constantly on the lookout for new lines that we appeal to our guests. We have already launched 7 premium skincare brands this year and we are thrilled to announce that two more super-luxe lines are on the way available now on target.com and in select stores. In March 2015 Target is adding S.W. Basics of Brooklyn and Nuxe to its lineup of premium skincare products.", "All new in beauty, Skinfix, experts in steroid-free skin healing solutions for the whole family debuted its incredibly effective product exclusively at all US Target stores and online at target.com. Skinfix products are based on an original formula created over 150 years ago by pharmacist Thomas Dickson in Yorkshire, England.", "And in hair care we are seeing continued momentum in natural with our Made to Matter products and we are excited about recently added salon products like Proganix from Vogue and exclusives like Procter and Gamble's hair food and L'Oreal's Dessange.", "In healthcare, we announced earlier this week that Target and Kaiser Permanente are teaming up to launch four Target clinics in Southern California. For the first time at Target, guests will have access to expanded services not typically available in retail clinics, including pediatric and adolescent care, well woman care, family planning and management of chronic conditions like diabetes, and high blood pressure.", "And coming in 2015, our new pharmacy app, Target Healthful, will allow guest to organize and transfer prescriptions, check prescription status, and order refills.", "And finally of course, we are designing our marketing plans to bring the entire holiday season together from amazing products to outstanding deals. Our holiday marketing campaign is designed to encourage people of all ages to let loose, get into the spirit and feel the unmistakable joy of the holiday season.", "The advertising will boldly embrace the iconic elements that make Target, Target. Lots of red, white and our lovable mascot Bullseye. The campaign will include broadcast, radio, out of home and catalogues and we are increasing digital media support by 50% over last year.", "Target stores will be transformed with fun and whimsical in-store decor created in partnership with David Stark, one of the top event planners. This year we are partnering with innovative New York retailer STORY which brings an editorial lens to retail and reinvents itself every four to eight weeks from merchandise and store design to floor plans and fixtures, bringing to life a new theme or trend. From Target's design partnerships to its everyday collections, STORY has curated its favorite holiday treasures from Target alongside its other must-have items for the season.", "We just launched our kids Wish List app on October 31st, a modern and digital take on the classic tradition of creating holiday wish lists for parents and kids. Kids can add must-have items to their list, while parents can share the list with friends and family, plus guests can save 10% on their wish lists on one day of their choosing before November 26th.", "Through the holiday shopping season, Cartwheel, Target's industry leading savings app will offer daily deals for its more than 11 million users. And from November 2nd to December 24th, it will feature 50% off, a different joy everyday. The app will have new features for the holidays including special deals for top users, personalized recommendations, and a select number of popular offers that don't expire. As always REDcard holders get 5% off nearly all purchases, free shipping at target.com and an extra 30 days for returns. Since 5% REDcard rewards rolled out in 2010, Target has saved guests more than $2 billion and we will thank guests for their loyalty with perks throughout the holiday season.", "We know our guests are pulled in a million different directions as the holidays get underway, so we are helping them save time and money by offering more access to Black Friday deals. Whether shopping online, on their phone or in our stores, Target guests will find Black Friday deals on top guests throughout November. We already offered early access to Black Friday deals for one-day only on November 10th. We've announced a presale on Wednesday, November 26th, and Cartwheel will feature access to additional Black Friday deals between November 23rd and November 29th.", "On Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday deals will be available first in the morning on target.com, then at 6 pm, Target stores will open for Black Friday shoppers and the first several 100 guests will receive a Christmas cracker, gift synonymous with the holidays in many parts of the world which will include a Target gift card or coupon.", "On Black Friday, from 6 am to noon, guest can purchase up to $300 in Target gift cards at a 10% off at Target stores and target.com, the first time Target has ever offered a discount on Target gift card purchases. The following day additional Saturday only deals will be available in Target stores and at target.com.", "And finally beginning Monday December 1st, guests will find new deals everyday at target.com as part of Target's largest ever cyber week sale with more than 100,000 items on sales throughout the week. The offers will include category-wide sales in key gifting areas and steep discount on apparel, toys and housewares. More information and deals will be available at the end of November.", "As we look back at an eventful year, we are pleased with the steps we have taken to improve our performance in both the US and Canada, and our financial results show that we are making meaningful progress. While there is much more work to be done, we are confident in our plans for the upcoming holiday shopping season, and pleased with our progress in -- charting a longer-term course for the Target of the future.", "Now I will turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our third quarter financial performance and our fourth quarter outlook. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks Kathee. Our third quarter financial performance was better than expected driven by stronger than expected sales and operating margin performance in our US segment. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was $0.02 or 2.9% below last year reflecting a decline in US segment profit partially offset by the benefit of reduced losses in our Canadian segment.", "GAAP EPS of $0.55 was $0.01 or 2.7% higher than last year benefiting from the resolution of tax matters in the quarter. Our third quarter US comparable sales increase of 1.2% matches our best performance in the last two years.", "Digital sales in the US including flexible fulfillment grew more than 30% contributing about 60 basis points to our US comparable sales. With ship-from-store capabilities now fully in place, we expect digital sales growth to accelerate to nearly 40% in the fourth quarter.", "Our third quarter US segment EBITDA margin rate of 8.5% was ahead of our expectations driven by a better than expected SG&A expense rate of 21% which is about 20 basis points lower than last year. This performance was the result of our expense optimization efforts, better leverage on stronger than expected sales, and retiming of some expenses into the fourth quarter.", "US REDcard penetration was 21% in the third quarter, up about 110 basis points from last year driven by growth in both credit and debit penetration. As we described last quarter, applications for new REDcard debit cards are running below last year causing penetration growth to decelerate from last year's pace. We believe this trend will continue in the fourth quarter when we expect US REDcard penetration will be flat or up slightly compared with last year.", "With the success of recent initiatives designed to increase REDcard applications, we expect the fourth quarter will mark the low point in year-over-year penetration growth after which we should see a reacceleration in 2015.", "In our Canadian segment, third quarter sales were below our expectations growing 44% above last year reflecting sales from new stores and a comparable sales increase of 1.6%. As I mentioned last quarter, the comparable sales metric in Canada will be noisy until we fully annualize the rapid pace of last year's store rollout. Given the sustained grand opening surges we experienced in those stores and the densification around early cycle stores that occurred later in 2013.", "REDcard penetration continues to grow in the Canadian segment reaching 4.2% in the third quarter compared with 2.9% last year. As expected third quarter Canadian segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates improved somewhat from last year, and EBIT dollar losses were about 18% lower than a year ago. While this improvement is encouraging, financial results in this segment remain unacceptable. And as Brian mentioned earlier we need to see a significant step change in Canadian segment financial performance.", "Outside of operating results in the US and Canada, our third quarter GAAP EPS of $0.55 reflects a few items not included in adjusted EPS. Specifically, $0.05 of accretion related to the resolution of income tax matters and $0.04 of offsetting dilution from data breach related costs, reduction in beneficial interest asset and impairment losses.", "Moving to consolidated metrics, third quarter interest expense was flat to last year, and we paid $330 million in dividends in the quarter, and increase of 21% over last year. As expected we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter. And given current performance and our goal to maintain our single 'A' debt ratings, we don't anticipate any share repurchase in the fourth quarter as well. Of course the timing and magnitude of any future share repurchase activity will depend on the pace of improved financial performance in both the US and Canada.", "Before I move to our outlook, I want to first address our inventory, which at quarter end was about 7% above last year. This increase was entirely driven by our US segment and was the result of two factors. While a third of this increase relates to our recent efforts to reduce out-of-stocks on commodity products, while the remainder reflects receipt timing including the impact of our efforts to manage around slowdown at West Coast ports. Bottomline, we feel very good about our current US inventory level. ", "Now let's move to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As we consider the broader environment, we see some encouraging signs including lower gas prices than we've seen in some time. However consumer spending patterns remain quite volatile, and we expect the competitive environment will remain highly promotional this holiday season.", "Based on this backdrop and the Q3 to Q4 expense retirement I covered earlier we are continuing to plan cautiously and maintaining our prior full-year guidance despite stronger than expected third quarter performance.", "In the US we are expecting a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of about 2%. So far in November, we are running ahead of our forecast but I will quickly remind everyone that the bulk of the season remains ahead of us.", "We expect our fourth quarter US gross margin rate will improve somewhat from a year ago. Last year in the US, we faced unexpected gross margin headwinds because of the data breach including the pre-Christmas weekend in which we gave our guests 10% off every transaction along with incremental clearance markdowns resulting from softer sales.", "So while we expect the typical year-over-year gross margin pressure from an intensely promotional and highly competitive fourth quarter, we believe that pressure will be more than offset by the benefit from annualizing last year's breach related markdowns.", "We expect our US segment SG&A expense rate to be flat to down slightly from last year as the benefit from expense optimization and better leverage on a 2% comp is expected to be offset by the timing of expenses which moved from the third to the fourth quarter. Altogether, our outlook is for the US segment EBITDA margin rate to improve 50 to 60 basis points compared with last year.", "In Canada, we expect a high single digit increase in total sales driven by a mid-to-high single digit increase in comparable sales. We expect the gross margin rate of around 20% much better than last year's 4% rate which resulted from extreme clearance activity and reserves taken on excess inventory.", "With an expected SG&A expense rate of between 35% and 40%, we anticipate fourth quarter Canadian segment EBITDA losses of about $100 million, an improvement of about $160 million compared with last year.", "Turning to consolidated metrics, we expect a small increase in fourth quarter interest expense compared with last year. And for the first time this year, we expect our tax expense to be higher than last year in light of the expected improvement in profitability.", "Altogether these expectations will lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.13 to $1.23 well above the $0.90 we earned last year. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS is expected to include $0.02 of dilution from the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any future data breach expenses which are not expected to be material.", "For the full year, the center of our adjusted EPS expectation remains at $3.20. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 lower than adjusted EPS reflecting a variety of adjustments including debt retirement and breach related expenses.", "Fourth quarter will mark a notable inflexion point as we annualize the data breach and expect to see the first year-over-year increase in operating profit this year. This would provide clear financial evidence of the healing process we've been engaged in throughout the year, and we look forward to entering next year with an energized team and positive momentum in our financial performance.", "With that we will conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Sean Naughton", "", "Good morning, and thank for taking the question. So John, you mentioned there has been a lot of talk about gas prices and the potential positive benefit on the consumer. But just curious if you could speak to the potential benefit you may receive on the P&L from a distribution standpoint? And if those are savings that are there, how would you guys look to use those additional distribution savings between flowing through to earnings and potentially reinvesting to drive traffic?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah, I think a couple of things. Certainly there would likely be some benefits if we continue to see fuel prices come down, but we haven't reached the threshold where fuel surcharges begin to come out of our contracts and I think importantly given the great work the team has done to manage some of the port issues out west, we are working around that and moving some freight further, expediting some freight, flying some freight, and I think net-net, that will probably be more of a drag than any fuel savings we will see.", "Sean Naughton", "", "So \u2013 and then I just guess just the second question on the overall basket, the UPT continues to be -- to decline and actually looks like it'll decelerate a little bit on a two-year basis. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around that particular dynamic either at the store level perspective given the higher food concentration I would be expecting that to improve but maybe this is being offset by online? And I guess the follow-up would be is how do you improve that dynamic moving forward? Thanks.", "Kathee Tesija", "Yeah, Sean, this is Kathee. It's predominantly a mix story for us. So we have higher ticket items like all the Apple products including the launch of the iPhone 6 in the quarter. We've got video game consoles that are higher, we have a lot of trade-up strategies both in inessentials like you talked about like in grocery with organics, but also in areas like skin care which I described a little bit earlier. So this is really a mix story.", "Sean Naughton", "", "So it's less about the shift between online and store at this [point in time] [ph].", "Kathee Tesija", "Correct. Yeah.", "Sean Naughton", "", "Thank you, and best of luck for the holiday.", "John Mulligan", "Thank you, Sean.", "Operator", "You next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo.", "Matt Nemer", "Good morning and congrats on improved US results. My first question is on expenses in the US. They've basically been running flat on a dollar basis this year, down a little bit per foot. I am wondering if you can get into a little more detail on what's driving the cost savings, and then in terms of the outlook, is this a line that you think you can run flat to up in dollars, up slightly in dollars over the next year or so or should we expect it to grow a little faster than that.", "John Mulligan", "Hi Matt. Yeah, I think the expense savings I would tell you, we've talked about the expense optimization efforts all year, been very focused on that and has been across the entire enterprise and we've seen good news in SG&A and also in the cost of goods. There are a couple of areas I would point out the stores performance has been outstanding driving productivity increases while still continuing to remain very strong guest service scores, frankly our guest service scores historically, so we have seen great performance there. And then it's just really many other areas. There's been great work done in marketing around the circular. There's been great work done in our transportation and how we optimize our network of transportation. So really across the enterprise. I think importantly to your question about [Indiscernible], we believe there continues to be significant opportunity for us to continue to take expense out and so for the foreseeable future we would expect to continue to see expenses very well controlled and to lever expenses at really -- relatively modest increases in sales.", "Brian Cornell", "And it's Brian. And to build on John's point, and as I discussed in my prepared comments, as we move forward, we recognize that we are going to continue to need to focus on expense management to fuel the investments we are going to make to drive continued growth across our store base and our digital platform.", "So as we come back to you in the spring and we talk more specifically about our strategy, you should expect us to continue to talk about cost optimization efforts and how we will use those efforts to reinvest in the fuel that's going to drive our growth.", "Matt Nemer", "Okay, that's great. And then secondly on target.com, I wanted to ask a question about the free shipping program. Does the incremental volume offset the incremental shipping expense? Is it profit accretive? And do you think that the customers that are utilizing this offer are high life time value customers?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yeah, it's not accretive. I will tell you we do ship even prior to the holiday free shipping. We do free ship a lot more than perhaps you would think and certainly more than some of our competitors given REDcard and the fact that that ships free all year round.", "So we have seen -- we know it's the number one frustration with our guests and the number one reason for abandoned cards. And so it was important for us this holiday season to be able to take that friction away and we have seen meaningful move in orders and conversion because of it. So we are very pleased with the result so far.", "John Mulligan", "Yeah, Matt, the only thing I\u2019d add while not accretive -- the only thing I would add is it\u2019s not material either to our results in the fourth quarter.", "Matt Nemer", "Okay, very helpful. Best of luck this holiday.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you, and congrats. Regarding the -- the great idea regarding signature categories and where you are focusing there, how would you help us just prioritize which categories have the most opportunities in terms of lead time and revenue mix and timing of impact? And is the extrapolation there that traffic will be the biggest kind of comp upside driver as you do focus on these categories? Thanks.", "Brian Cornell", "Yeah, Oliver I think as we go forward, and as Kathee and the team really elevate our focus around those signature categories, categories like baby and kids, wellness and style, you should expect to see additional focus in store. You should see additional innovation, partnerships. But really ensuring that we are leading with trend, we are anticipating what our guest is looking for in those categories, and those are categories that Target becomes famous for. And we are certainly going to double down our efforts in those categories because our guest has asked us to. There are categories that are very important to our guest. They are synonymous with the Target experience the guest is expecting. And you will see signs of that as we move into 2015 and beyond. Certainly some of the work that Kathee and her team have done in preparation for the fourth quarter are already bringing our efforts to life in apparel. Some of the things that we have done in home, the partnerships that Kathee talked about in her prepared comments, our continued focus on baby and kids and we know how important toys are during the holiday season. So we are already making progress in those spaces.", "But I also want to make sure it's really clear that does not mean we are walking away from other categories in our stores. They just play a different role in our future strategy and there'll continue to be areas where we are going to look to improve our execution and performance. But from a prioritization standpoint we think those signature categories that we\u2019ve talked about are key to the guests. The guest has told us those are critically important to them and Kathee and her team are working rapidly to ensure that we continue to build our position, enhance our assortment, and bring great newness and innovation to those key categories.", "Kathee Tesija", "So a couple of things I would add to that you will already see in stores right now. Brian talked about those four areas, baby, kids, wellness and style. So in baby, about 200 stores have a new presentation where we have invested in labor in the stores to help guests create registry and gift givers find the perfect gift.", "We have added mannequins and things that help the presentation. I also chaired today the registry that we have redone completely - the whole experience from the in-store hardware to the software that we use and how that helps guests create registries much easier. We are already seeing the benefit of that.", "Wellness, we have talked a lot about Made to Matter, and better for you products. So you see that already this year. And then in style just to touch on that for a minute, we now have about 650 stores that have our new presentation in apparel including mannequins. So already some progress and we will continue to push forward in those areas and you will see more and more as the months and year goes on.", "Brian Cornell", "Oliver, the final point I'd add, as we think about style. Certainly apparel and home are critically important in that space but so is beauty. And as John and Kathee have referenced, we use one of our standout categories in the third quarter and we expect continued strong performance as we exit the year.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. And just as a follow-up that's related. There seems to be a lot of energized agility Brian regarding -- thinking about what Target stands for from a bigger picture perspective. What are some of the initial thoughts on where you see that opportunity as you work to further differentiate and innovate yourself?", "Brian Cornell", "Oliver, I think, we are making progress across a number of different areas. Certainly we talked about omni-channel, and really making sure that we are a significant player in this space. We are seeing very strong performance up over 30% in the third quarter. John talked about that that we expect that performance to accelerate in Q4. We clearly took away the pain point of shipping by announcing free ship in the fourth quarter and we think that's another way for the [indiscernible] to declare we are significantly committed to this space.", "We are seeing a great response to Cartwheel and have 11 million users today, and we are going to use that to make sure that we use digital as the front door to connect to the target brand going forward.", "We talked about some of the progress that's being made in merchandising and we've got 35,000 new items in stores for the holiday. And we are going to continue to test and partner as we continue to make sure we are bringing the right solutions to our guests.", "If you haven't seen some of the holiday creative, I think it's some of the best Target\u2019s delivered in years and I am getting emails and comments from guests and friends and people I know everyday talking about their reaction to the holiday creative and how the curative campaign it's uniquely Target. And we are certainly upping our game both in-store. But we are also going to spend significantly more in digital this year to touch our guests no matter how they are connecting with the brand.", "In-store we have made significant progress in a very short period of time going from testing, ship-from-store, to now we are in 38 markets, 136 stores where our stores are acting like flexible fulfillment centers. You can shop there, you can pick up there, but they are also shipping to -- directly to our guests. And allows us to cover 90% of our marketplace in a very short period of time. Takes the pain away from that last mile.", "So I think you are going to continue to see us make these points and that's a sneak peak of Target in the future. And I think that is creating positive energy in the organization.", "Kathee and I are hearing really positive things from our vendors. Our organization knows we got to be more -- we got to show more agility, we got to be responsive, we got to make sure we are externally focused in following the guest. I think you are seeing some of those things take shape today.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. Thank you very much. Best regards for the holidays.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You next question comes from Wayne Hood from BMO Capital.", "Wayne Hood", "Yeah Kathee, I have questions, maybe a little bit longer terms in places of the context of how you evolve a company and that is related to where you see AUR trending because you are talking about more of this is in kids and baby which typically is lower ticket and maybe pulling back on promotions and electronics because that's not cooler. I am just wondering where you think you are AUR might land over the next few years in light of kind of 2% to 3% growth you've been experiencing under the existing strategy. And then if you could talk about -- John, if you could talk about the growth in inventory next year and its impact on working capital as you think about being better in stock on the ad merchandise and the like? Thank you.", "Kathee Tesija", "We haven't modeled exactly what that will be yet. But I would tell you I think it will be moving up for a couple of reasons. So you heard Brian talk about those areas that we are going to focus on and really being famous for them in delighting our guests. And when we are at our best we offer both expect more pay less together in all of these categories and that means a really thoughtful balance of good better best having clear features and benefits as we move up that ladder allowing guests to be able to buy whatever is important to them but importantly offering really good trade-up opportunities. So you are seeing some of that right now in some categories. But I think as we move forward, and we become famous again for some of these categories, there will be a lot of trade up opportunities.", "So I would say overall, seeing it moving up.", "Brian Cornell", "And Wayne, your second question, inventory, I think, the one thing I would say if you look at our number this quarter, 6% to 7%, all the US, really only about a third of that do we view as temporary. The vast majority of that was receipt timing. But that curve we expect to stay around; we started that in second quarter this year. We will cycle it again next year in second quarter somewhere around 2% to 3% increase for the first half and next year. But offsetting that ultimately as we start to get back to positive comp sales, we should see faster turn and that should ultimately lead to better payables leverage.", "So not a meaningful impact overall once we get past fourth quarter here on our working capital.", "Wayne Hood", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "You next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich", "Thanks. I have two questions that are maybe a little bit linked. John if we start on dotcom which if my [indiscernible] writes around 2.5% of sales in the quarter. What does that do to the margin going forward? I know you mentioned it sort of immaterial for the fourth quarter but tell us what it did in the third quarter and how we should think about it? I mean it's probably dilutive of some effect and whether it's more in gross margin or SG&A? And then I had a follow-up.", "John Mulligan", "On margin, it's definitely dilutive, Greg, if for no other reason in the shipping expense. And I think as it continues to grow, that will put margin pressure on the P&L and we've talked a little bit about this. There are lots of puts and takes in gross margin as we think about it going forward that we're working through today. As that business grows, it will be margin dilutive. But as we increase penetration of ship-from-store and pickup in-store that significantly not only improves our guest experience, but significantly improves the P&L.", "We're also balancing how we look at pricing right now and balancing inventories across the network as we ship from store. So some of those are up, some of those are down. And we're working through right now where ultimately gross margin will land.", "Greg Melich", "And then the follow-up, and maybe Brian, you -- in your comments, you talked about making sure in the five-key operating principles, that invest to build capabilities. I love your perspective on -- this year CapEx is down a lot and we're running I guess a little over $2 billion as the run rate. What do you think is the CapEx need sort of going forward to invest in what Target really needs to do to be the best it can be?", "Brian Cornell", "Greg, we're assessing that right now as we think about 2015 and beyond. But you should expect us to be investing in the capability to continue to build out our digital experience, to continue to enhance our in-store experience, to make sure we have the analytical tools to properly manage expenses and margin even more surgically going forward. And I talked about -- while certainly in the early stages, we're going to continue to look at smaller formats and how we use smaller formats to penetrate urban markets, allow our guest a chance to interact with the Target brand both in-store, but also continue to build out the opportunity for them to purchase online.", "So we're in the early stages of assessing our long-term capital needs, but you should expect us to be investing in the right capabilities and tool to provide long-term shareholder value and allow us to continue to fuel our growth and enhance both margins and continue to manage operating expenses effectively.", "Greg Melich", "Would that mean CapEx would be above D&A at some point in the future or do you think you can stay below that?", "John Mulligan", "Greg, we think -- at least Brian said I think with the caveat that we're working through this right now, we think we're probably in about the right range right now. The spend may move around a little bit. I think the one wild card is the point Brian made about small formats. But I would note that obviously the investment there is significantly below what a prototypical Target would look like. So it would take a lot of those to meaningfully move our CapEx number. So like we've talked about something in for the US in that $2 billion -- $2.5 billion range still makes sense, but we're doing the work right now.", "Greg Melich", "That's great. Thanks a lot. Good luck for holiday.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "", "Thanks a lot and good morning. I know there's a lot of big picture questions to discuss, but actually I have two quantitative ones related to the quarter. First of all, John, can you talk about the expense, the magnitude of the expense dollars that shifted from the third quarter to the fourth and talk about perhaps functionally speaking what they're related to?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah, most of it is marketing moved around. And the magnitude, if you think about us beating by somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.09, is a little bit less than half the beat. So somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million moved between the quarters.", "Matthew Fassler", "", "Got it. Thanks for that. And then secondly, you talked about running ahead of the fourth quarter plan. Just as we think about the cadence of that plan, obviously you had a tough January as did many retailers particularly given the breach. So when you say running ahead, is that running ahead of the 2% number as we speak or running ahead of a plan that's maybe a bit more nuanced than that as we think about where we are in the progression of the quarter and your compares a year ago?", "John Mulligan", "Well, I wouldn't want to get into that level of detail. Clearly, last year pre-breach was stronger than post-breach, and we took that into account as we thought about the calendarization of the plan, and right now we're running ahead of that and we feel good about where we're at, not only relative to the plan, but on an absolute basis is what I'd say. But there is a lot of business left to be done before we get to the end of January.", "Matthew Fassler", "", "Got it. Thank you for both of those, appreciate it.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the food category. And recognizing you're not going to deemphasize it, you're just going to streamline it, how are you thinking about the return profile of that space within the store? And then could there be any differences in amongst how space is allocated, could that area get less over time?", "Brian Cornell", "Yeah, and let's drop back and make sure we clarify our point on the food category. We have no intentions today to streamline those categories. But Kathee and the team are certainly stepping back, listening to the guests, really understanding what the Target guest is looking for in food. From an assortment standpoint, from a newness standpoint, we talked about the fact that as we go forward, you should expect to see more natural and organic offerings. We've seen a terrific response from the guests, it's something that we call Made to Matter, a collection of items that are on trend for our Target guest, feature a number of exclusive items that Target from manufacturers that are in the organic and natural space, that can bring great innovation, gluten-free, on-trend products to our guests. And we certainly recognize that we have an opportunity to connect with the guests in a different way when it comes to food. But you shouldn't expect us to deemphasize those categories. That's not the point. We're not streamlining our food offering, but we are stepping back and really listening to the guest, making sure we curate on their behalf the right items that are uniquely Target that meet the needs of our guests in the food categories.", "So a lot more to come as we talk about this in the first quarter, but to make sure we're really clear, we're not streamlining food. We're not de-emphasizing food, we're not walking away from food. But we certainly want to make sure we put our mark on the food category with items that are uniquely Target, that are right for our guests, that are on trend, and you should certainly expect to see more natural, organic offerings in that space because the Target guest has asked for them.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay, that's very helpful. And you think you can manage the return profile on that space to certainly meet the hurdle lights that you expect from it?", "Brian Cornell", "We would certainly expect to see that, and Kathee talked about some of the changes we're seeing in mix. And certainly when we talk about natural organic, when we talk about some of these unique items, they tend to have a higher average unit rank.", "So you should expect to see some mix changes, but importantly, food is an important part of our future. We're not going to deemphasize the category, we're not looking to take away space. We want it to be more impactful, more on trend, and we want to fill it with items that the Target guest is looking for.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay, that's very helpful. And good luck with the rest of the holiday.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you, appreciate it.", "John Hulbert", "That concludes Target's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 25, 2015.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Sorry about the technical difficulties that delayed us a couple minutes there. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.", "This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance and our priorities going forward. Then Kathee will provide insight in the holiday and fourth quarter results across our merchandise categories. And finally, John will provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.", "Finally, given that we are hosting our financial community meeting in New York next week. Our remarks today will focus on Target\u2019s fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. At next week\u2019s meeting, we will describe in detail our longer term expectations including full year 2015 financial performance.", "As a result we are shortening today\u2019s call to 45 minutes and will look forward to spending another two-and-half hours with all of you next week.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the fourth quarter and holiday season. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks John, and good morning to all of you. I appreciate your patients this morning. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning.", "Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than last year and above the high end of the updated range we provided in our January 15 press release. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was also stronger than the updated guidance we provided in January, as we saw unexpected strength in our store channel sales in the last two weeks of the quarter.", "And of course, we look back at our point of view going into the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth turned out to be nearly double our original expectation. As our combination of products, promotions, holiday marketing, fulfillment capabilities and in-store execution drove profitable growth in an intensely promotional environment.", "We are pleased that comps in all three months of the quarter were positive. And November strength was particularly notable, given that we were analyzing a strong increase in November 2013. We are also pleased that traffic was the primary driver of our fourth quarter growth as well as the fact that the digital channel growth contributed nearly a full percentage point to our fourth quarter comparable sales increase.", "Our fourth quarter gross margin performance was also very strong, with a favorable mix reflecting strength in signature categories. Our merchant teams did an outstanding job, managing inventory flow, benefiting both in stock and gross margin, which was particularly challenging this quarter in light of the slowdown in productivity at the West Coast ports.", "Once again, our store team did an outstanding job of managing costs in the fourth quarter, delivering productivity improvements along with outstanding service to our guest. As I\u2019ve mentioned to many of you, one of our priorities going forward is to harness best practices from our stores and apply them to the rest of the organization, to modernize the way we work and derive productivity improvements or maintaining quality and everything we do.", "If we look back at the full year, it\u2019s clear that 2014 was a year of transition in which we begin to lay the foundation for the transformation we will accomplish in the next few years. A year ago, we were in the recovery mode, working to repair guest relationships following the data breach while we undertook an assessment of the long-term prospects for our Canadian business.", "Fast forward to today and we\u2019ve ended the year with the data breached fully behind us and that we\u2019ve made tough decision to execute the Canadian business. Our team is focused and aligned on five priorities, I outlined in our third quarter call.", "The first priority is to drive industry leading digital sales growth. As we build the capabilities, become a leading omnichannel retailer. Our digital growth led the industry in 2014 and we\u2019re working to build on that success in 2015 and beyond. Our second priority is to clearly define roles for each of our merchandise categories and build appropriate plans for each of them.", "While we\u2019re in the early stages of this journey, I\u2019m pleased with our efforts, to invest in the growth of our signature categories like style, baby, kids and wellness. These are the categories we\u2019re most famous for, and our guest has asked us to lead with them in the years ahead. Beyond these signature categories, we\u2019re defining appropriate roles for each of our categories. And we\u2019ll invest in them appropriately to ensure we\u2019re providing our guests convenience through a differentiated, inspirational and one-stop shopping experience.", "Our third priority is to become much more localized in the assortment and experience we provide in our stores, and more personalized in our digital interaction with our guest. We are in the very early stage of these efforts, and we see huge opportunity ahead of us. So we\u2019re investing these capabilities we\u2019ll need to make progress on this priority over the next few years.", "Our fourth priority is to build and test new formats that will help us better serve our guests over time. We\u2019re seeing strong financial results from our eight City Target stores and we\u2019ve seen very strong initial performance in the test of our first Target Express location, which opened here in the Twin Cities last August.", "In 2015, of the 15 new stores we\u2019re planning to open more than half of these are new formats with eight additional express stores and a new City Target set to open in Boston, next to Fenway Park. And finally, we\u2019re committed to reducing complexity and controlling costs in order to fuel our investments and the growth priorities I\u2019ve just outlined.", "As mentioned earlier, our stores have been leading the way in these efforts. So the next few years, we are looking for opportunities outside our stores, become more agile, move faster, gain scale efficiencies in the way we work. We believe meaningful opportunities exist. And the leadership team is committed to moving decisively. The modernized way we work and create the capacity we will need to invest in the priorities that will drive growth and return on invested capital.", "At our meeting with you next week, we are looking forward to providing you more specific on how we\u2019re planning to advance these five priorities, while providing insight in how our plans will translate in the financial results, both this year and over the long-term.", "Our plan for the day is as follows, I\u2019ll lead off the day by providing details on our strategic priorities, our approach to growth, and the principles guiding our leadership team, as we work to deliver on these priorities. Then, John, will provide more detail on our financial expectations for each line of the P&L going forward. And he will provide full year guidance for 2015 financial results from continuing operations, reflecting our plan to grow earnings per share this year.", "Casey Carl will follow with details on our digital progress and his plans to transform the organization by developing new capabilities that will support our growth, control cost, and recapture the innovated spirit that\u2019s part of the company\u2019s DNA. Then, Kathee Tesija will provide more insights into our core guests and our plan to develop products, experience and formats to serve those guests over time.", "And then Jeff Jones will provide insight into the guest relationship with the Target brand, and his team\u2019s work to modernize our marketing and the way we interact with today\u2019s core guest. Finally, we\u2019ll end with a Q&A session.", "We are looking forward to the opportunity to share these plans with you next week, and we\u2019re confident that we can build on the early momentum we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. We have a fantastic foundation to build on with a great brand, loyal guests, and an outstanding team. And we are committed to maintaining our focus on our key priorities, and making the tough decisions to position Target for long-term success.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathee, to recap our fourth quarter and holiday season performance. Kathee?", "Kathee Tesija", "Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. retail landscape, this year\u2019s holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced a pattern we\u2019ve seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales in the early and late portions of the season and experienced a period of softness in the middle.", "Specifically, throughout November, our comparable sales performance, including the Black Friday weekend was very strong on both the one-year and two-year basis, driven by strong promotions throughout the month, combined with in-store events and Cartwheel daily deals. In December, following the characteristic lull that we have seen for more than a decade we saw a very strong surge in traffic and sales in the days leading up to and after Christmas.", "And in January, we continue to see unexpected strong results throughout the month. As Brian mentioned, we saw particularly strong trends in fourth quarter sales in our signature categories. Specifically, healthcare, beauty, apparel and home, all grew faster than our overall sales.", "Within apparel, results were strongest in baby and kid, and home comps were led by domestics and seasonal items. In hard lines, our toy category had a fantastic quarter recording a double-digit increase in comparable sales driven by a strong line up of Target exclusive items throughout the assortment.", "Average retails, were up across all of our categories, as guests were trading up within assortments and we saw strong regular price sell-throughs in seasonal and markdown sensitive categories.", "Digital channel growth also contributed to the growth in the average retail, particularly in home and apparel, both of which saw digital channel penetration growth of more than a percentage point in the fourth quarter.", "Throughout the holiday season, we were very pleased with the performance of our fourth quarter limited time partnerships with TOMS and Faribault Woolen Mill. Guests responded to the stories behind these brands, and were delighted by the combination of quality and price we could deliver.", "I already mentioned the great quarter in toys, which we supported this year with the launch of our Kid\u2019s Wish List app. A fun, interactive way for kids to let their families know which gifts were at the top of their list.", "We saw strong guest engagement with this new app, as nearly half the families who used it, created a list for two or more kids. And by the end of the season, thousands of new target.com accounts had been created by Wish List users.", "Our attention getting offer to ship all digital orders for free during the holiday season provided compelling value and convenience to our guests. The offer created a surge in traffic and conversion on both our conventional site and mobile, which as expected, was partially offset by a moderate decline in average transaction size.", "Because our guest responded so well to this holiday promotion. We were excited earlier this week to announce that going forward we are reducing the order threshold for free shipping from $50 to $25 with virtually no exclusions.", "This new minimum is among the most compelling offers in digital retailing, putting us ahead of many of our key competitors. In our digital channel for the fourth quarter overall, we saw a high single-digit increase in visits, driven entirely by growth in mobile which includes both tablets and smartphones.", "Orders were up well over 50% driven by very strong conversion increases on both the conventional site and mobile. Mobile is becoming increasingly important to all digital retailers and given the profile of our guests, it\u2019s particularly important for Target, as mobile accounted for more than 40% of our digital orders in the fourth quarter. And notably on Black Friday, 10% of our iPhone app revenue was from guests purchasing on their phone while they were simultaneously shopping one of our stores.", "Our flexible fulfillment efforts play a key role in supporting our digital growth, and we\u2019re pleased with results of our store pickup program and our recent roll out of ship-from-store capability. This is the second holiday season in which we\u2019ve offered store pickup. And since last year, we\u2019ve added more dry grocery items, extended the pickup window from two days to four days and we\u2019ve begun testing dedicated parking spots.", "This year we had more than 400,000 store pickup orders on the Black Friday week alone. And they accounted for half of our digital traffic in the last four days leading up to Christmas. For the year in total, 84% of store pickup orders where picked on time and 35% of the time guests who picked up a digital order also shopped the store on the same visit.", "This is our first holiday season with ship-from-store capabilities having rolled out to a 139 stores at the end of the third quarter. This capability allows us to ship more than 60,000 items directly from stores to our guest\u2019s front doors, dramatically cutting shipping times while reducing our shipping costs.", "We were pleased with the ability of this initial group of stores to handle the shipments from their back rooms which peaked in the last week of November. And importantly this capability allowed us to continue to fulfill holiday orders late in the season for items which were already sold through in our fulfillment centers, but still available in our stores allowing us to capture incremental sales.", "Before I move to our plans going forward, I want to pause and discuss the situation at the West Coast ports. As you know, the slow down at these ports began several months ago and our fourth quarter performance clearly demonstrates that our team was effective in handling this slow down by rerouting, expediting and preordering inventory to support in stock.", "We were very pleased with last weekend\u2019s news that a tentative agreement had been reached, but what we know it will be sometime before the backlog at these ports will be fully eliminated. In the mean time, we have contingency plans to continue to work around potential issues. But at times, we may encounter periods of light inventory in some assortments.", "Now I want to give you a few highlights of our plans going forward, and of course we will have much more to cover with you next week. Last year, we began to test and roll out a variety of store presentation, innovations to elevate the shopping experience and differentiate our brand based on the guest response to these changes, we\u2019re planning to accelerate our roll out in 2015.", "For example, following the addition of Mannequins at the apparel floor pad, in more than 600 stores last fall, we are planning to roll them out to another 400 stores this quarter. And based on the guest response to our enhanced, entertainment and electronics experience which is currently in 42 stores, we plan to roll this environment out to another 275 stores this year.", "In home, we have begun testing highly inspirational vignettes to show product in lifestyle settings which we\u2019re rolling out to another 15 stores this quarter. Farther back in the testing phase, we are looking at innovations to bring even more fun to our toy area. With easier navigation, interactive experiences, larger than life displays, and floor graphics. We\u2019re always looking for creative platforms to engage guests in new ways that are meaningful to them.", "Snapchat provides a fun channel for us to quickly share exclusive behind the scenes content with our guests that they can\u2019t get anywhere else. If you were one get anywhere else. If you were one of the fans who witnessed Target\u2019s Snapchat debut, you caught a glimpse of the first story which teased our history- making Grammy commercial with Imagine Dragons, to announce the Target exclusive version of their new album containing four exclusive bonus tracks.", "Jeff will have more to say about this groundbreaking Grammy moment at our meeting next week. Guests are excited about the recent launch of our new plus-sized brand Ava & Viv which launched earlier this month. Designed by our own product design and development team, Ava & Viv feature stylish basics, along with trend-driven statement pieces. Similar to Target\u2019s other apparel lines, Ava & Viv will be updated monthly, with prices ranging from $10 to $80.", "And the anticipation is building for our upcoming partnership with Lilly Pulitzer. With a modern interpretation of the American resort wear brand\u2019s exuberant prints and patterns, the limited edition Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection features 15 exclusive prints, which are original works of art created by Lilly Pulitzer artists specifically for this modern collaboration.", "Available exclusively at all Target stores in the U.S. And on target.com beginning April 19, 250-piece collection includes apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls, as well as home accents, outdoor entertaining accessories, beach gear, travel essentials, and more.", "And finally, as Brian mentioned, wellness is one of the signature categories in which we\u2019re investing to differentiate our brand and our assortment from competition. We have a huge opportunity in this space, because our guests have told us it\u2019s particularly important to them.", "Specifically, nearly every household that shops at Target buys natural and organic products, and more than half of them indicate that they\u2019d prefer to purchase natural and organic products when available. These guest insights are reinforced by their behavior in our stores. While overall sales in the natural and organic industry are growing rapidly, sales of these categories at Target are growing even faster, outpacing the industry by 50% in 2014.", "The Made to Matter collection remains one of the most prominent and active examples of Target\u2019s focus on wellness. Offering guests a selection of natural, organic, and sustainable products across multiple categories. In 2014, sales of the brands featured in our Made to Matter collection grew twice as fast at Target than they did elsewhere in the market.", "In 2015, we\u2019ll reinforce our commitment to newness and better for you choices with a refreshed Made to Matter hand picked by Target collection. This year\u2019s collection will double in size compared to last year, delivering more than 200 new and exclusive products from 31 leading and upcoming brands.", "As we look ahead to the New Year, our priorities in merchandising are clear. We will build appropriate plans for each of our categories, based on the role they play in supporting our brand and delivering a superior shopping experience. In our signature categories, we will invest in product development, marketing, fixtures and store service to elevate and differentiate both the assortments and the shopping experience.", "Fully delivering on our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise, our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making some early progress in this work, and we are dedicated to moving much faster in this transformation in 2015. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our fourth- quarter financial performance and our outlook for first quarter 2015. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better than expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 was better than the high-end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update, and about $0.11 better than our expectations for U.S. performance at the beginning of the quarter.", "Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.49, about $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS driven by a combined $0.02 of dilution from the reduction of the beneficial interest asset, combined with net data breach expenses. Partially offset by the benefit from the resolution of income tax matters.", "Fourth-quarter GAAP EPS losses of $4.10 reflected $5.59 in losses from discontinued Canadian operations. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was above the guidance of around 3% that we provided in our January update, and nearly double the 2% growth we expected at the beginning of the quarter.", "More than all of the sales outperformance in the last few weeks of the quarter was in our stores, as digital channel sales came in a bit softer than expected in those last few weeks, reflecting a slowdown in demand sales growth as we annualized over promotions from a year ago, combined with returns which came in somewhat higher than expected. Even so, digital channel sales increased a robust 36% in the fourth quarter, on top of a very strong increase in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "And as Brian mentioned, digital channel growth delivered about 90 basis points of our fourth quarter comparable sales increase, up from a 60 basis point contribution in the third quarter. U.S. REDcard Penetration of 21.1% was about 20 basis points ahead of last of year and inline with our expectations.", "As I mentioned in last quarter, a strong trend in new accounts, we believe this quarter represented a trough in penetration growth. And we expect to see a moderate reacceleration in penetration growth in 2015. This growth should benefit later in the year from the introduction of chip and pin technology for all of our REDcards and the change over to MasterCard on our legacy co-branded Credit Card program.", "Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 9.9% was so much stronger than expected driven by very strong gross margin rate performance, partially offset by a small increase in our SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our fourth gross margin rate of 28.5% was nearly a percentage point higher than a year ago, and the strongest fourth quarter performance we\u2019ve seen since 2010.", "This year\u2019s rate benefited from a favorable mix of sales growth in our signature categories, combined with better markdown rates as we annualized last year\u2019s clearance and promotional activity following the announcement of the data breach. I want to pause here and comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 6% higher than last year.", "This increase was intentional, and reflects two separate decisions. First, in the last six months, we\u2019ve chosen to increase our inventory in commodity categories to enhance in stocks in these frequency driving businesses. And second, we are ahead in some import categories in light of the slow down at the West Coast Ports. Bottom line, the inventory increase as result of specific decisions we\u2019ve made, and we feel very good about our overall inventory level as we enter the new fiscal year.", "Getting back to the fourth quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage on pay in benefits. Offset by higher marketing, technology, and incentive expense rates compared with last year. Altogether, our fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year.", "Moving to consolidated metrics, fourth quarter interest expense was up about 6% from last year and we paid $330 million in dividends in the quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. As expected, we didn\u2019t repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. However, as we discussed in our January update, the exit from the Canadian market will meaningfully improve our credit metrics going forward. And provided the wind down of our Canadian operations continues to push as planned, we will be in a position to revisit the possibility of share repurchase later in 2015.", "As always, I will reiterate, that we will only resume repurchase activity if we believe it can be accomplished within the limits of our current investment grade credit ratings. As we look back at full year performance in the U.S., our 2014 adjusted EPS of $4.27 was down slightly from $4.38 in 2013, driven by early year challenges, as we recovered from the data breach.", "However, the healing of our business has been evident in the progression of our financial results throughout the year. Specifically, comparable sales, digital channel growth, and year-over-year gross margin rate performance all improved as we moved throughout 2014. And expenses remained well controlled throughout the year.", "Next week at our meeting with you in New York, we will outline in detail our plans to build on this early momentum over the next few years. Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, I want to cover a small change to our adjusted EPS reporting, which we present in order to reflect the results of operations from what is now a single segment business.", "Given that we have now amortized $151 million or two-thirds of the original value of the beneficial the beneficial interest asset related to the 2013 sale of our credit card receivables portfolio beginning in 2015 we will no longer remove the amortization of the beneficial interest from our adjusted EPS calculation. This is because both the quarterly amortization amounts and the year-over-year changes in those amounts are expected to be immaterial going forward.", "And therefore, we believe our reporting will be streamlined be streamlined if we make this change. In our reporting throughout 2015, prior year adjusted EPS results will also reflect this change to ensure consistency for comparison purposes.", "With that, let\u2019s move to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect our comparable sales to increase about 2%, driven by an increase in digital channel sales of 30% or more, combined with the modest growth in store channel sales. While it\u2019s still early in the quarter, our results for the first few weeks of February are consistent with that forecast.", "On our first quarter sales, we expect our gross margin rate to improve 40 basis points to 50 basis points from last year. As we annualize last year\u2019s very intense promotions, which we used to recapture traffic coming out of the data breach. On the SG&A expense line, we expect our first quarter rate to be flat to down slightly from a year ago.", "As we expect that the benefit from store productivity improvements will be offset by higher marketing and technology expense rates compared with last year. We expect our D&A expense rate to be about 10 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of continued investments in technology to support our digital and flexible fulfillment efforts.", "Altogether, we expect an improvement in our first quarter EBIT margin of 30 basis points to 40 basis points above last year. First quarter interest expense should be approximately flat to last year. And tax expense is expected to be about $15 million higher than last year, reflecting improved profitability and a higher consolidated tax rate compared with a year ago.", "Altogether, these expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business of $0.95 to $1.05 compared with $0.92 year ago.", "As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, I\u2019m going to wait till next week\u2019s Financial Community meeting to provide specific guidance for full-year 2015 earnings growth as well as our expected financial algorithm over the longer term. This will allow us to present our financial outlook in the full context of our specific business plans, which reflect necessary investments to accelerate growth and build capabilities, along with the opportunity to reduce costs over time, providing fuel to fund those investments.", "With that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s Simeon Gutman. First question on gross margin for John or for Brian, it was quite solid in the fourth quarter, last year you had a little pressure but not nearly as much as I guess we all expected give some of the discounting. So can you talk about what drove the expansion year-over-year in this year\u2019s fourth quarter?", "John Mulligan", "Sure, I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m sure Kathee will jump in. I think overall what you observe is there\u2019s strictly some savings relative to last year with clearance activity that went on but I think much more important to that is you saw the acceleration of the signature categories. Home, apparel, style, kids. Many of those with margin rates well in excess of our average margin rate and I think for the first time Kathee and I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time where both home and apparel outcome of the company. So we\u2019ve really saw a very strong mix in the quarter delivered by the product in the stores.", "Kathee Tesija", "Yes, on top of the mix, I would also say that regular price sell-through was very high. So less on clearance on markdown and more on full retail and which also contributed.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. And just one follow-up, I\u2019m sure this will get addressed next week, but can you just tell us what the average wage for full-time associates and/or part-time associates are at Target?", "John Mulligan", "You know, we don\u2019t disclose the average wage for our team members. What I\u2019d tell you is the store\u2019s team has always been appointed differentiation for Target and we\u2019ve always prided ourselves and believe we have the best team in retail. So very focused on ensuring we have competitive wages and that we\u2019re developing our team members. We\u2019re all the time assessing the marketplace to determine competitive wages and making adjustments and we feel very confident that we\u2019ll be paying the teams appropriately.", "I think importantly, if you look at our team leaders, 60% of them came from team members. So development is a really big part of what we offer to as they progress. Overall as we look at some of the announcements that have been in the marketplace and the minimum wage legislation act really hasn\u2019t changed our view of the quarter or the year really at all and won\u2019t be material changes to us.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay.", "Brian Cornell", "I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to receive this question again next week, but to John\u2019s point, and our goal is to make sure we have the very best team in retail. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in their development and make sure that from a marketplace standpoint, we\u2019re very competitive with the wages we provide. So I\u2019ve been very pleased to learn that over 60% of our team leaders actually started as part-time hourly employees. That development is critically important. It allows us to attract terrific team members. And as John stated, we do not expect to see any material change next year.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. Thanks. See you next week.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer", "Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on that last comment around wages. Brian, could you just provide some context around how much opportunity you think there is to reduce complexity and improve efficiency in case you needed to respond to wages or you wanted to respond?", "Brian Cornell", "Well, it\u2019s certainly going to be an area that we\u2019ll highlight next week. I think you\u2019ve captured it really, really well. Our focus right now throughout the organization is to reduce complexity, simplify the way we work, the way each and every day, continue to empower our to make the right decisions that are going to impact the business. We want to create an organization that\u2019s much more agile, that moves with much increased pace as we go forward.", "And we deliver the right innovation and product that our guest is looking for. So it is a significant area of focus for us. We\u2019re going to talk about it in great detail. But we think it\u2019s going to be a very important part of our strategy going forward is going to fuel the key growth priorities that we\u2019ve been talking about we\u2019ll go through in great detail next week. But our goal is to make sure we eliminate complexity at Target, we simplify our operating model, we empower our team members, and create an environment where we\u2019re agile, we\u2019re taking advantage of marketplace opportunities, and we\u2019re bringing products and services to market that respond to the needs of our guest.", "Matt Nemer", "Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the higher online return rates. Do you think that\u2019s primarily a function of the free shipping offer? Is it more prevalent in certain categories? And is it related at all to error rates?", "John Mulligan", "Actually, the return rates were higher than our expectation, but they were essentially right on last year. We had seen some improvement throughout most of the year and they basically just returned to last year, so not a material change, just a little bit different than our expectation for the last couple weeks.", "Matt Nemer", "Understood. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. The first thing I wanted to poke at was frequency. Brian, you mentioned that you were pleased with the frequency going up in the quarter. Is that a focus for the company to drive frequency to the stores and kind of maybe as preview \u2013 how do you get it done?", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, while there\u2019s certainly a number of critically important metrics as we look at the business going forward, I can tell you that the entire leadership team is prioritized, one, increasing traffic to our stores, and two, visits to our site. Those are critically important as we go forward.", "So we\u2019re going to do that by executing many of the priorities that we outlined today. We certainly want to make sure we\u2019re building the right digital and importantly mobile capabilities that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests. Not only when they\u2019re shopping at home but also when they\u2019re shopping inside of our stores. And Cartwheel is a great example of how we\u2019ve used digital to drive greater engagement.", "I\u2019m really pleased, and Kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter. And it\u2019s critically important that while we\u2019re in the early stages, we\u2019re already seeing the guests react well to our focus on style, on baby, and kids, and importantly wellness. And the fact that healthcare and beauty and home and apparel outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter is a sign that we\u2019re connecting with the guest and we\u2019re certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in store.", "So our focus on elevating signature categories we think brings our guest back to Target more often. They\u2019re going to be coming back in to see what\u2019s new. And Kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new exciting products coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience and merchandising. So those elements are critically important.", "We think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guest, which will result in more traffic and more visits and certainly as we expand our smaller formats. Both City Target and Target Express, it\u2019s a way for us to engage the guest in these urban settings that are critically important.", "So all those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement but the metrics that are going to be important for us is to ensure it results in more traffic like it did in the fourth quarter and more visits to our site. So we\u2019re pleased with Q4. Lots of work in front of us. But I felt very good, as did the entire leadership team that our comp increase of 3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. And our industry leading growth in digital was certainly going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site.", "Scott Mushkin", "That\u2019s perfect. And I just had one quick follow-up. I have a ton of questions but I\u2019ll just do one quick follow-up to what you said, Brian. You did mention \u2013 although Kathee did. She mentioned food. How do you think of food in context to traffic? Then I\u2019ll yield. Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, I think you already know the answer to that and we\u2019re going to talk about this specifically next week. Food is very important to our guests. And they\u2019ve confirmed that with us as we\u2019ve gone back and researched the food category through the eyes of the guest recently. We all know food trips drive traffic. And we want to make sure we compliment our signature categories with guests that are coming to us for the great food products we can curate.", "We recognize we have a lot of work to do in food. And Kathee and I were recently out in the market together. We spent several days visiting our stores, looking at competitive food retailers as we begin to build our reinvention plans for food. But as Kathee will talk about next week, we recognize we need to make changes to our assortment, Made to Matter and some of the changes we\u2019re making right now in our assortment that deliver more organic, natural, gluten-free items critically important to the guest.", "And we also recognize we have to change the in-store experience and really make sure our food and grocery merchandising compliments the great experience we create at Target. So a critically important area of opportunity. We won\u2019t get there overnight. It will be a multi-year transition. But food is going to play a very important role in complimenting our other signature categories and making sure we drive traffic to our stores, in to our site.", "Scott Mushkin", "Thanks, that was great answer. Appreciated.", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, thanks. Hopefully we will see you next week.", "Scott Mushkin", "Definitely. Looking forward to it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thanks a lot, and good morning. If you could frame some of the marketing and technology spending in the fourth quarter, just let us know what that was directed towards. I know you\u2019re holding back to some degree on 2015 guidance, but were some of those initiatives that you expect to persist through the upcoming year?", "Brian Cornell", "Matt, we\u2019ll certainly go through much more of this next week. I think if you were to look at the changes we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter, the big change would have been a significant increase in our digital support of our brand. So as we continue to make sure we\u2019re connecting with our guests, we are connecting with them the way they are looking to connect with the Target brand, digital is going to play an increasingly important role.", "And we were very pleased with our overall marketing in the fourth quarter. We had some outstanding creative on air. It received very positive response from the guest. And we complimented that with a very strong digital campaign. So I felt and the team felt very good about the progress we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter.", "We had created that broke through the clutter, connected with our guest \u2013 drove traffic to our stores. We complimented that with really impactful, digital and online communication and tied that back in with great in-store marketing. So you\u2019ll see more of that as we go forward in to 2015, and we will take you through a lot more of the investments and the plans we have when we see you next week.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffray.", "Sean Naughton", "Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the food question and then specifically inside of the fresh component of the business. This was supposed to be a big part of driving transactions to the store over the long-term. Could you just maybe give us a little bit on, where Target is with its fresh offering today? How is it evolving? And are you happy with the performance with the sales and margins on this segment of business?", "Kathee Tesija", "Yeah, Sean, we are going to talk about food in much more depth next week, but fresh is a very important part of food, not only traffic and number of trips for our guests, but just in terms of what\u2019s important to them, in terms of wellness. Fresh food plays a very important part.", "And as Brian said, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do here. So both in Super Target as well as in P Fresh format, and it centers around our assortment, how fresh the product is, and ways that we can improve upon that, the presentation showing abundance in that great product. So we have a lot of work to do, but critically important to us because our guest has said they want to be able to eat better both natural and organic. We see it in our results today, and we know that there is much, much more opportunity.", "Sean Naughton", "Okay, then maybe as a follow up here, just on the inflation front, can you just give us an idea of how inflation trended maybe across the store in the quarter and your expectations, kind of in near and medium term? Thank you.", "John Mulligan", "Sure, lots of variability across categories as always the case. We saw some inflation in food. We saw a lot of deflation in electronics like we always do, but if you look at across the entirety of our business essentially flat to last year. So no net impact to the business from inflation in aggregate, but as I\u2019ve said lots of variability within that.", "Sean Naughton", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you look back at the fourth quarter, can you do mention what you think \u2013 how the performance was driven by your own initiatives, the easy comparison versus last year? And just an improving macro environment due in part to the lower fuel prices. If there\u2019s any way you could potentially quantify that, I think it would be really helpful.", "Brian Cornell", "Michael, let me start. I\u2019ll let Kathee and John jump in. I think you\u2019ve certainly identify some of the big levers. And I think as we sit here today, we\u2019ve recognize that the consumer confidence is certainly improved. Lower gas prices certainly helping the industry overall. We did have some favorable overlaps certainly as we overlap the breach. But I also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, and we continue to deliver great execution and service inside the stores.", "And when you look at the two years stacks, we had a very challenging November, a very strong November from 2013 that we overlapped and saw growth. And that to me, it was a sign that not only was the consumer healthier but they were choosing to spend their dollars in Target stores. And they came back in December, as Kathee alluded to, we had a very strong close to the holiday season.", "But importantly we felt really good about traffic and our performance in January, particularly in the last two weeks of the quarter. So a combination of \u2013 we certainly did have some issues from last year that we\u2019re overlapping. The consumer we do believe is healthier. And we\u2019re pleased that they\u2019re spending in our stores, both in our stores and online. But I also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint. We had terrific marketing and a great digital connection with our guest.", "We were able to leverage both an improved in-store experience, the convenience of shopping online and picking up in store, and we had industry leading online sales and we leveraged our stores to help make sure that we fulfill the needs of our guest. So I think the combination of all those elements added up to a very solid quarter.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay, thanks for that. Please go ahead, Kathee.", "Kathee Tesija", "The only thing that I\u2019d add to that is, just that, a lot of that focus came in our signature categories, which is why you saw our growth there in particular. Major investment in product, both quality as well as aesthetic and number of SKUs, newness that we brought to the market. The marketing reinforce that, and that was very well received by our guests. And then coupled with presentation both online with enhancements in app and our desktop site, and the presentation in our store driven by focus on signature categories really helped drive our growth.", "Michael Lasser", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. The follow up question I had is, are there any particular call outs you can offer about the strength in the last two weeks of the quarter? It just strikes as interesting and we\u2019re curious about what drove that strength. Thank you.", "John Mulligan", "I think we continue to see gift card redemption. We intentionally \u2013 we had a significant gift card promotion on Black Friday that was very successful. We saw all of those come back in January. I think that helped. And we saw continued strength in the product in home and apparel, very strong sales in home and apparel and I think that was an element of it as well. I think it\u2019s a combination of both.", "Kathee Tesija", "And our wellness business is healthy as we turn the corner in to the New Year, we saw that continue. So that the trade up that we had seen during Christmas. We saw continuing in to January which is just guest choice for products in our discretionary categories. I think lots of things drove it.", "Brian Cornell", "Michael, I think, well summarized, I\u2019d put four elements on the list. John talked about gift cards. I think that was very important. And we certainly saw our guest come back to Target with gift cards after the holidays and through January. Our focus on wellness certainly well received by the guest. We had great newness in our stores to start the New Year. And our store teams did a terrific job of recovering after the holidays. And we offered our guests a very strong in-store shopping experience. So a lot of the basics.", "But our gift card plans were well executed. We saw the guests come back in January. Our focus on wellness that important signature category, well received. We brought newness into the stores to start the year. And our store teams did a terrific job of recovering after a very busy Christmas holiday season.", "Michael Lasser", "Thank you so much, I appreciate it.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you. I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question today.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich", "That\u2019s great. Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ups. It would be great to know \u2013 you said the signature categories did well. Do you have the actual numbers like which ones were better by category for food and wellness, et cetera?", "Kathee Tesija", "Well, health and beauty were both very strong. In the health categories, that spread across many categories. I talked about Made to Mat ter. I talked about better for you product in food. But it was also in our health business. And our style business both beauty was strong as well as in apparel it was driven really by kids and by babies. And in home it was domestics and seasonal product. Then in kids, we had incredible season in toys with a double-digit comp. We really were pleased with the overall holiday.", "John Mulligan", "Greg, as we mentioned earlier in the call, wellness, home, apparel all comped in excess of the 3.8 we reported for the quarter, so strength across all those categories. And to win in the fourth quarter you have to win in toys. Well, our team won in toys, and showing a double-digit comp was critically important. So we felt very good about the early progress in those signature categories. And we\u2019ll build off of that momentum as we go into 2015.", "Greg Melich", "And maybe to follow-up on that momentum and seeing the traffic get back to up 3%. When you look after your first quarter, that 2% expectation, do you expect traffic to be half of that comp or positive in the first quarter? Or what was built in your expectation?", "John Mulligan", "I think, Brian, hit on in earlier, right. We continue to drive for positive traffic. I think positive in the store and growing digital online and that\u2019s part of our guidance.", "Greg Melich", "Great. And then, John, may be a quick follow-up on SG&A, it looked it and I could be backing the math out wrong here, but SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter accelerated to maybe 4% or 5% growth. Was there anything that caused that in particular?", "John Mulligan", "Yeah, I think like we said, a little bit of deleveraging. There was some marketing expense we talked about in November, moved from November into \u2013 or from Q3 into Q4. As Brian said, we made some investments in marketing. The other elements were ongoing all year. We had some technology. The thing that really drove a lot of it relative to the other quarters was incentive expense. We clearly out delivered our expectations and that will be reflected in our incentive expense.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks for joining us today. That\u2019s going to conclude our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation today and we really look forward to seeing you next week in New York City, so thank you again.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conference call.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 19, 2015.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, currently our Chief Financial Officer who has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer effective September 1st; and Cathy Smith, who is the named Chief Financial Officer effective September 1st.", "This morning, Brian will discuss our second quarter performance including results across our merchandise category and plans for the third quarter and remainder of the year, then Cathy will provide her perspective as she prepares to join the team as Chief Financial Officer next month, and finally, John will offer more detail on our second quarter financial performance and discuss our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Following the remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release which is posted on our Investor Relations Web site.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his perspective on our second quarter performance. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John and good morning to all of you. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter.", "We are also pleased that once again this quarter we were able to grow traffic and sales both in stores and in digital channels, even as we were cycling over a very promotional second quarter from last year. Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our expectations. Notably about two thirds of this comp increase was driven by a growth in traffic combined with the smaller increase in average ticket.", "Second quarter digital sales grew 30% from a year ago slightly below our expectations as we compared against very intense digital channel promotions last year. Digital growth contributed about 60 basis points to our comp sales growth this quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was a half a percent point higher than last year. As we continue to benefit from favorable merchandise mix and the comparison over last year\u2019s promotional markdowns. On the SG&A expense line we had an unexpectedly strong quarter as we benefited from discipline throughout the organization along with the impact of expense timing as John will cover in a few minutes. With these results we continue to benefit from very strong cash generation by our core business which enabled us to return a combined $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchase.", "As we\u2019ve outlined in last several quarters we\u2019re working to define clear roles for each of our merchandise categories and avoiding resources to growing what we call our signature categories; style, which includes the majority of apparel, home and beauty categories along with baby, kids and wellness. While we are still in the early days of this work we\u2019re already seeing a compelling benefit from our efforts. Specifically comp sales in signature categories grew more than 7% in the second quarter, three times our overall comp growth. This performance represents an acceleration from the first quarter when comp growth and signature categories was about doubled Target's overall comp growth.", "With strong signature categories performance comps in both Home and Apparel were in the 4% to 5% range this quarter. In Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids along with women's ready-to-wear. Within Home, results were strongest in the core and seasonal including back-to-school. Other categories highlights this quarter included toys part of our Kids focus in hardlines, which saw more than a 12% increase in comp sales. This growth helped offset comps decline in Electronics which is a primary beneficiary of the second quarter promotions last year and we were also seeing soft sales in tablets. Outside out stores, our focus on style was evident as more than 80% of our second quarter digital channel sales growth was driven by Home and Apparel. In Home where digital penetration is much higher than average, digital channel growth have of our total comp this quarter.", "Looking ahead we'll continue to work to advance the key strategic priorities we laid out last fall. First on our list is to become a leader in digital, this is critically important because guest research shows that digital relevance drives traffic and engagement across all selling channels. While we're pleased with the industry leading growth we've seen so far this year we have much more work to do and a key asset will deploy is our source. We're already shipping digital orders from approximately 140 stores and by the end of this year we'll be shipping for more than 450 locations.", "Ship-from-store capabilities allows us to balance inventory across the network, leverage the capital and labor already in our stores and reach guest more quickly. To highlight the benefits in improved shipping times, this fall we'll begin testing what we're calling available-to-promise in which we'll the guest a specific delivery commitment typically 2 or 3 business days. If the guest orders on a specific date, we believe this capability will drive further increases in digital conversion rates which are already improving rapidly as guest respond to a faster and firmer delivery commitment.", "Second on the list of key priorities is working on category roles, beyond our efforts to grow signature categories, we're also focused on testing and learning how we can reposition our food offerings to better serve our guests. While this work won't be complete until next year we're engaged in many small tests throughout the country to gain a deeper understanding of our how guest would respond to potential changes in assortment and presentation. Through guest research, we already know we need to be more clearly highlighting Wellness in our food offering through both assortment and the information we provide. We're also focused on ways to elevate our food presentation and experience to fit the way the guests live and shop.", "We know we have an opportunity to provide fresh healthy options and more relevant and localized assortment as our guests responding to healthy choices we're offering today. Within food our market share in Wellness is already doubled our food share overall and this quarter we continue to see double digit sales growth in these important categories. This clearly shows that our guests are already responding when we enhance assortment of natural, organic and better-for-you items in our stores. As a result in the third quarter we'll continue to expand our Wellness assortment in food with new food items in our made to matter collection and nearly 50 new items across 6 categories in our simply balanced brand.", "Our third priority is to develop capabilities to offer more localized experiences across our stores and a more personalized digital experience for our guests. While this work is ongoing we're already seeing encouraging signs of the early progress on both fronts. To inform our localization efforts we launched a small test in the Chicago market where we're working with a set of stores to test changes to assortment, presentation and inventory commitments on certain items. In these stores we're highlighting locally relevant items, updating category adjacencies and changing shelf facings to reflect the demographics around these individual stores.", "While this test is still early we're encouraged with the guest response so far specifically comp performance in this group of test stores has been 1 to 2 points higher than the rest of the Chicago market and a set of controlled stores. Items featured in the tests are present in 5% to 10% of the guest baskets in these stores and we've seen a meaningful improvement in our guest survey stores for variety of products in these stores. Giving these strong initial results we're working to quickly build on our capabilities and create an operating model that allows us to scale our efforts across a broader set of stores and demographic clusters.", "As part of our personalization efforts last year we replaced the third party recommendation engine with internally developed product which incorporates both in-store and online guest history. In 2015, we've expanded the use of engine across our mobile offerings, email, subscriptions and cartwheel. This engine is driving a meaningful increase in conversion compared with our results on the prior third-party product generating incremental sales of $50 million to $100 million so far this year. We've rolled out personalization recommendations to Cartwheel only a few weeks ago but early data indicates the change is driving more than a 10% increase in the number of offers downloaded per user, a critical co-measure of engagement with this app.", "Our fourth priority is to test and roll out new, more flexible format in markets where populations are increasing, guest affinity for Target is high and our store penetration is low. This quarter we were very excited to open a new City Target store in Boston literally next door to Fenway Park. And we're pleased with the look and feel of the store and the positive response we've seen from our neighbors. We began work on develop the store a decade ago well before we had smaller formats and for this project we're able to open a full sized store in a dense urban area. However this opening begs a question of the criteria we're using to designate stores as City Targets, a Target Express or simply Target. As a result we announced last month that going forward we will no longer use the City Target or Target Express names on any of these new stores. This announcement doesn't reflect a change in our desire to open stores in urban areas. It simply reflects our goal to become flexible and how we fit into every community with an ability to open up a variety of stores, different sizes and layouts, offer a locally relevant assortment and provide guests with easy access to items from our entire digital assortment through in store pickup.", "Our fifth and final priority is to advance our growth initiatives by changing the way we work and becoming a more effective and agile organization. This week we announced several changes to our team including John's promotion to the newly created Chief Operating Officer role and the hiring of Cathy Smith as our new Chief Financial Officer. I am very excited about these changes and confident that John and Cathy will play a critical role in Target's long term success. In the past year I developed a deep appreciation of John's knowledge and insight. And I believe he is the right person to improve our operations. Retail is changing rapidly today than any time in my career and we need to ensure that core operations keep pace with the new ways we're serving the guests. Overtime Target has developed an incredibly complex supply chain, built to serve an outdated linear model in which product flows from vendors through distribution centers to stores. To serve guests today we are becoming much more flexible in a way we fulfill demand for products and services. And this is stretching our supply chain well beyond its core capabilities.", "And frankly, as a result some retail fundamentals have started to suffer. Specifically in stocks in our stores have been unacceptable so far this year. And our guests deserve better. In this new role I've asked John to focus first and foremost on improving the capabilities of our supply chain, working across organizational boundaries to understand and address root causes that are hampering day to day execution. Beyond these immediate needs I've asked John to continually assess and evolve our capabilities to ensure our operations keep up with our strategy and a rapidly evolving retail landscape. As we plan to move John into this critical Chief Operating Officer role it was really important to me that we hired a Chief Financial Officer who is a proven leader. Someone capable of upholding Target's strong track record of disciplined financial management. So I'm very excited that we've convinced Cathy Smith to join our leadership team. She served as a CFO at other large organizations including Wal-Mart where Cathy and I were colleagues.", "I have the utmost confidence in Cathy as a strong financial and business leader. She'll be an outstanding addition to our leadership team and John and I look forward to supporting her transition into this role. One year ago I was only a week into my new position when I spoke on this earnings call. As I look back at the last year I am very pleased with our progress and confident we're focused on the right strategic priorities because our guests are responding. As we plan for this year we face the daunting challenge of sustaining traffic and sales without repeating last year's promotional intensity. So far this year traffic and sales are increasing, digital growth is far ahead of the industry and signature categories are leading the way, yet we will not slowdown.", "We'll continue to invest in newness, innovation and presentation while we focus on maintaining strong execution. We're seeing encouraging results in back to school, and back to college and we'll work hard to maintain that momentum for the rest of the season. Also this quarter we're excited about our new planned program including more than 50 items from our latest design partner Adam Lippes, beyond Adam's design our planned takeover will feature 100s of other products across a broad set of categories. Beyond apparel, accessories, home and pets you'll find planned soda bottles, shampoo, bandages, paper towels and more. We\u2019re pleased with the early reaction and the media buzz and looking forward to rolling out these items throughout the quarter.", "Target is also featured permanently in the September issue of Vogue which includes a 21 page insert where we\u2019ve re-imagined some of the most iconic covers by incorporating products we sell. This insert will be digitally shoppable so our guests can go behind the scenes to buy what they see and access additional content. And while that becoming even more important in the fourth quarter we\u2019re already ramping up our support around this year\u2019s hot license products for kids both young and old. For Minions to Marvel, Avengers to Peanuts and of course Star Wars. These licenses are prominent in our assortment of back-to-school backpacks and this fall we will feature them on Halloween costumes, d\u00e9cor, apparel, toys and much more.", "Before I end my remarks I want to pause and thank the Target team including the colleagues I met on my recent trip to India who are doing amazing work in sourcing and technology to support our strategic growth priorities. For our team members around the world this has already been a very eventful year and we made changes to our team and our structure to better support our guests. Throughout all these changes the team has remained resilient and energetic where the passion to serve our guest is contiguous. Every day I step back and marvel at the amazing things this team can deliver, iconic marketing, amazing products at an incredible price, fast and easy digital experiences and of course a unique store experience that brings our expect more pay less promise to life every day. None of this would be possible without our great team. And the outstanding results we\u2019ve seen so far this year are a testament to their efforts. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Cathy Smith. Cathy won\u2019t officially begin her role until September 1st but I\u2019m pleased that she is here today to introduce herself and share a few thoughts about Target and her new role. Cathy?", "Cathy Smith", "Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. Like Brian I have long admired Target as a retailer and an iconic brand and a great American company. During my career I\u2019ve had the opportunity to view Target through the lens of a competitor and of course a guest. And now I am really excited and humbled to have the opportunity to join the team as we work to transform how we serve guests while preserving what consumers love about this brand. While I won\u2019t start working here until next month I\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to know the leadership team and I have had the opportunity to meet with many of the members of the finance team this week.", "Target\u2019s success comes from many things beyond the iconic brand the company has an impressive array of owned and exclusive brands as a guest and someone who loves retail I\u2019m constantly impressed by Target\u2019s ability to delivery new, trendy, high quality items at amazingly low prices and I just know there are incredible product design developed and sourcing teams behind those items. In addition in appreciate that Target has just added 1,800 well maintained great looking stores in convenient locations delivering a great shopping experience and near and dear to every CFO\u2019s hearts we have a healthy balance sheet which when combined with our strong cash flow generation creates ample capacity to fund robust investments in growth and the return of billions of dollars to shareholders annually through dividend and share repurchases. And lastly Target has its passionate team members who work tirelessly to serve our guests every day and who are proud of their Target.", "Let me tell you a brief story, as I was exploring the possibility of joining this amazing company I wanted to move beyond the familiar experience of shopping at my Target so I dedicated a couple of weeks to visit more than 65 stores across 10 states and I drove my family along for most of the ride. I spoke to guests at every store I visited and I can tell you that they are clearly demanding enthusiasts they love Target and they enjoyed sharing their personal stories about why they chose to shop with us.", "Before I close I want to say that I\u2019m looking forward to reconnecting with those of you I know and getting to know those of you I don\u2019t. I plan to scale my first few months with the team amercing myself in the business to ensure I have a detailed understanding of where we\u2019ve been, where we are today and where we need to go in the future. With that foundation I look forward to meeting you and hearing your perspective. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to John who will share his insights on our second quarter, financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, Cathy and hello everyone. We\u2019re really pleased with our second quarter results as virtually every line on the P&L came in at or better than our expectations. Compared with our guidance going into the quarter overall comparable sales were in line with expectations, but the mix of store sales was a bit stronger than expected. Second quarter gross margin performance also met our expectations, but SG&A expense performance was much better than planned reflecting our continued efforts to control costs along with the impact of a timing change in marketing expense. As a result our second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.22, $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter.", "Second quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.21, $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS as pretax restructuring costs and breach related expenses were 1 penny each were partially offset by $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters. Second quarter GAAP EPS of $1.18 reflects a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.25 loss on Canadian operations last year. This year's Canada losses were consistent with our expectations as an increase in our accrual for estimated probable losses primarily guarantee of leases was offset by an adjustment to the tax benefit from the Company's investment loss in Canada.", "Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Within the quarter, comps were strongest in May and June however this year's monthly pattern was the mirror image of last year's second quarter when the comp growth was strongest in July, which featured the most intense promotions in the quarter. As a result on a two year basis, monthly comp trends were very consistent throughout the quarter. Importantly, transactions were positive both in-stores and online throughout the quarter driving two-thirds of our comparable sales growth. Digital channel sales increased 30% in the second quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the second quarter last year. As Brian mentioned, second quarter 2014 was intensely promotional and those promotions were a key driver of digital channel sales last year.", "Looking ahead, we'll continue to focus on achieving our digital channel sales goals through a combination of both traffic growth and conversion improvement. REDcard penetration was 22.1% in the second quarter more than 130 basis points ahead of last year. Portfolio delinquency and write off metrics are at historically low levels and we continue to see increase in payment rates. This means the size of the portfolio continues to slowly decline but better than expected risk metrics are offsetting this impact. As a result profit sharing income on the portfolio was up this quarter compared to last year.", "One other note, this week we began accepting EMV or chip-card transactions at all stores across the country. As a result this quarter we will initiate the process of replacing all of our REDcard products with chip and pin cards including our private label credit and debit products. While sales were in line with expectations, our second quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.9% was much stronger than expected. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was half a point higher than a year ago right on our guidance.", "Consistent with the first quarter this year rate benefited from lower marked downs as we annualized last year's post breach promotional activity and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature categories. I mentioned this last quarter but I want to emphasize it once again, it is really important that we've been able to grow our traffic in sales even as we cycle over very intense promotions last year. Beyond the benefit of growing sales there was a compelling gross margin benefit from growing our signature categories three times as fast as the Company which more than offsets the pressure on our cost to goods from investments in quality, innovation and presentation.", "On the SG&A expense line we had a standout quarter with a rate improvement of about 60 basis points compared with last year. This performance was driven by outstanding discipline across the enterprise combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives. These benefits more than offset a 40 basis point headwind from incentive compensation which was unusually low in the second quarter 2014 in light of the financial performance we were experiencing at the time.", "As I noted earlier, marketing expense timing was a meaningful benefit this quarter. As last year\u2019s second quarter spending was unusually high to support our promotions and this year we've retimed some spending into the third quarter in support of our back-to-school licenses and Target style. This timing shift benefited our second quarter SG&A rate by about 30 basis points or about half our overall rate favorability and we expect this shift will reverse in the third quarter.", "Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our quarter end inventory position which was about 4% above last year. This reflects a meaningful improvement from the 9% year-over-year increase we reported at the end of first quarter driven by issues at the west coast ports. While we've made a lot of progress in the second quarter the year-over-year increase is moderated even further so far in August. As our quarter end inventory supported back-to-school sales that moved into early August as a result of retiming of some tax-free holidays.", "Bottom line we feel very good about overall inventory levels in relation to our sales plans; however, we have a big opportunity to improve in stock levels which I'll cover in a few minutes. One note, you'll see on the balance sheet that we've moved pharmacy inventory into the other current assets line in all periods reflecting the current status was held for sale pending the close of our transaction with CVS.", "Moving to consolidated metrics, second quarter interest expense was $148 million flat to second quarter 2014 excluding last year's $285 million charge for early debt retirement, we paid second quarter dividends of $331 million, up 22% from last year and we invested in other $675 million to retire shares that adds up to a total of $1 billion return to our shareholders this quarter representing more than 130% of net income. Looking ahead with healthy business results and an ample cash position, we expect to have the capacity to continue to returning a meaningful amount of cash through both dividends and share repurchases within the limits of our current investment grade credit ratings. As anticipated given our continued desire to repurchase shares, in the second quarter our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. As of quarter end under this program we have retired more than 65 million shares at an average price of just over $67 a share for a total investment of about $4.4 billion. With the expansion of the program we expect that sufficient repurchase authority well into next year including any potential repurchase resulting from the proceeds of the CVS transaction.", "Regarding that transaction things are continuing as expected as we work with CVS and regulators to advance the process of gaining approval for the sale. Given the uncertainty of potential timing for regulatory approval and the closing of the transaction the guidance we provide to-date does not reflect any expected impacts of the transaction which includes application of proceeds and removal of prescription sales, costs and assets from our financial statements. As I described last quarter this year we began reporting return on invested capital from continuing operations or ROIC because we believe it is an important metric in assessing the quality of our capital allocation decisions overtime. And as we covered in the financial community meeting in March our goal is to reach the mid teens or higher on this metric over the next five years.", "Not surprisingly given our strong operating results we reported a meaningful improvement in trailing 12 month ROIC this quarter as it grew 2 full percentage points to 13.3% compared with 11.3% a year ago. Now let's move to our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. In the third quarter we are cycling over stronger sales results from last year, both in stores and digital channels. And we expect the consumer competitive environment to remain choppy. As a result we are planning for a third quarter comparable sales increase of 1 to 2% including expected digital channel sales growth of about 30%. We expect our third quarter gross margin rate to increase 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year reflecting a continued mix from the signature category sales and a benefit from cycling last year's promotional activity, partially offset by investments in quality and price on our owned and exclusive brand products.", "On the SG&A expense line we expect our third quarter rate will be about flat to last year. As the benefit from cost control is expected to be offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the shift in marketing spend from Q2. Combining our gross margin and expense rate reductions we're looking for improvement in our third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year. Third quarter interest expenses is expected to be approximately flat to last year and tax expense is expected to increase by about $60 million reflecting improved profitability and non-recurring favorable tax items in third quarter last year. Altogether these expectations would lead to third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.89, compared with $0.79 a year ago. Note that this includes the impact of the shift in marketing timings which translates to a $0.05 per share headwind in the third quarter.", "As we look ahead to the full year we are certainly pleased with our results so far which have been notable stronger than expected and we have been pleased with comp performance so far this month, including back to school sales which reflected retiming of some tax free holidays into early August. At the same time we remain mindful of the intensely competitive nature of our holiday season and have noted the inventory levels we're seeing with some competitors. Taking both of those factors into account we're updating our guidance for the full year adjusted EPS to $4.60 to $4.75 a $0.10 increase compared with the prior range. Before I conclude my remarks, I want to pause and comment on my priorities as I enter the new role as Chief Operations Officer next month. As Brian mentioned, the number one priority for my new team is to improve the way our supply chain functions from end to end, achieving this goal, lead to many benefits perhaps the most visible of which is an improvement in our in stocks. Given the breadth and complexity of our business it will always be a challenge to the in stock on every item in every store in every moment of every day.", "But our guests need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials and unfortunately in the last couple of quarters our in stocks have been deteriorating. This challenge is understandable because we've been asking our supply chain to move well beyond its original design and become more flexible in the way we serve our guests. However while we understand the reasons the simple fact is that our current performance is unacceptable. So beginning this quarter my team will be looking for both quick and more comprehensive solutions to make improvements in the supply chain both this year and overtime, and beyond this initial effort we will work to ensure that our preparations and strategy move in lock steps enabling us to serve our guests in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. I look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months and years. With that we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Cathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Brian as you\u2019ve been so successful in this journey as traffics back to the stores, just a bigger picture question, how do you think your priorities have kind of dynamically changed throughout the year and where would you say Target is in terms of customers coming back to the store versus increasing customer spend? And John I had a question relating to the comp guidance as well.", "Brian Cornell", "Oliver, overall I think we\u2019re making really good progress against our key strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about for a year now. The change we announced this week is to make sure that we elevate our focus on execution and really ensuring operational excellence throughout the organization. And that is why I am so excited about John stepping into this new role to make sure that we complement the focus we have placed upon creating strategic clarity with a recommitment to operational execution. And I think the combination of those two elements is critical to continuing to drive traffic, make sure we delight the guest, seeing improvement in our net promoter scores and make sure that both in-store and online we are continuing to see an acceleration in traffic and visits to our site. So I think we\u2019re making very good progress right now. I think that is showing up in the results we delivered this quarter but we\u2019re not satisfied and we know we\u2019ve got more work to do to ensure that we do meet the needs of the guest every time they shop and critically important in meeting those needs is to make sure that we provide a great in-store experience and dramatically improve our in stock conditions particularly around core essentials. So I think very good progress I think this is an excellent quarter where the entire team performed well but we know we\u2019ve got more work to do and we got to make sure both in-store and online we deliver a consistently great experience for the guest.", "Oliver Chen", "And John I just had a question on the comp guidance, would you expect this to be a pretty broken up between traffic or ticket or do you think it\u2019s going to be more traffic led and as you do embark on the opportunity in supply chain, what are you highlighting as your lower hanging fruit in terms of timing and I was just curious about the categories that you seen the most opportunity for when you think about further advancing your supply chain?", "John Mulligan", "Sure. On the comp guidance we don\u2019t breakout traffic and ticket but I\u2019ll tell you just from a business perspective we\u2019re very focused on driving traffic overtime ultimately we have to bring people in our stores, we need to bring people at our site on to mobile devices and so that\u2019s a key driver for us for our sales as we continue to move forward.", "Related to the supply chain, there is the team has done a great job responding to the needs of the organization overtime to develop more flexible ways to meet the needs of our guests and really fulfill on demand shopping I think we are just at a point now where we need to step back and build broader capabilities across the entirety of the supply chain as we continue to expand the way we want to serve our guests. So there is not one particular area of the company or one particular part of the business that we\u2019re completely focused on absent I would tell you and as I said and you heard from Brian in-stocks are a key priority and in specifically being sure day-to-day in every store we\u2019re in-stock on essentials. That\u2019s a key priority for our guest. We hear it from them. It\u2019s a key focus for the team and we have teams working on improving those in-stocks across our essential categories to-date and that will be a focus as we go forward.", "Brian Cornell", "Oliver I can build on that because as we talk about improving our focus on operational and executional initiatives, now I go back to some conversations we\u2019ve had in the past. I actually believe we have the best team in retail. Our store operations Tina and her team do a sensational job. But one of the things that John will be focused on is ensuring we simply the work and we make it much easier for them to execute each day and take care of the guest. So we want to complement a very strong store leadership team that does a sensational job each and every day executing store by store by simplifying some of the work, by making sure that we push work upstream and allow them to focus even more on the store experience and the service we provide our guest.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.", "Matt Nemer", "First I was wondering to what extent you are using price to drive the 3x growth in signature categories, can you comment on what the growth and gross profit dollars for those categories has been like?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes Matt, I\u2019d tell you that the improvements we\u2019re seeing is really driven by mix and as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve invested heavily in ensuring we are on trend. We are bringing great quality to the guests. We\u2019re extenuating our position in key categories. We were really pleased during the quarter to see how well we connected with sub-cats like swim. We\u2019ve seen really strong performance in ready to ware and most recently a very positive response to the changes we made in denim, so the improvements we're seeing in those categories are really driven by great quality following the trend curves, bringing great style and fashion to our guest and it has not been driven by a reliance on pricing.", "Matt Nemer", "And then secondly, your comments regarding the supply chain being stretched I realized that the analysis is just starting or in the early days, but do you believe that there is a significant refinement required in the supply chain in terms of either DCs or FCs or something else?", "Brian Cornell", "No, Matt we are in a place where we have, we believe just great-great assets across the supply chain, great distribution centers, great upstream distribution centers, food distribution centers fulfillment centers and of course the stores. I think we've said over the past couple of years our focus of our investment has been supply chain and technology in support of becoming an on demand company that will continue to be the case. We're going to continue invest in technology and supply chain, but the physical asset side we feel really-really good about.", "Matt Nemer", "Okay that's great news and then if I could just sneak one more in, the early back-to-school strength and the marketing shift is that fully embedded into the Q3 comp guide?", "Brian Cornell", "It is and it would be and we're seeing a very positive start to back-to-school and back-to-college.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of David Schick with Stifel.", "David Schick", "Wondering if you could give us a few more examples concrete examples of how you are driving that localization success in Chicago categories or items and separately if you could talk a little bit about digital approach outside of your own platform so we've seen it and we've heard from you what you're doing and that's exacting and driving growth, but we've seen a little bit of your outreach to bloggers and how you're working with them if you could talk about the full view of how you're thinking about digital outside of the Target's headquarter that will be helpful as well? Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Sure, David let me start with localization and as I said during the couple of calls, this is still a very nascent effort for us. We're in one market a handful of stores in Chicago, but we\u2019d really been focusing on a handful of areas where we recognize we need to change our assortment, change our presentation, be more relevant and really recognize the needs and the demographics of these local markets. So, there is a handful of categories I might list up one craft beer and really making sure that in a category like craft beer we have locally relevant items and we recognized that even in a market like Chicago those need to be tailored neighborhood by neighborhood. So we have looked at specialty foods. We have looked at categories like craft beer. We have looked at categories like patio and grills, and recognizing in that end the suburbs of Chicago, we can offer and should have in-store large patio sets five burner grills, but for our stores located in more of the urban neighborhoods of Chicago we need Easter tables and we need two burner grills because those guests are living in condos and apartments, they've got small patios and we need to make sure we tailor our assortment and our presentation to recognize their needs and to make sure we're more locally relevant.", "So we're certainly seeing a lot of time looking at food and as we think about the food reinvention a lot of this is going to be driven by making sure we have locally relevant brands, those hometown favorites and also in broader categories like patio and furniture making sure that we're matching up our assortment in-store with the needs of that local guests. So a lot of additional work for us to do, but we're really pleased with the progress and I talked about 1 to 2 point lift versus the test and control stores adds a very important measure for us to continue to evaluate. And working with John and our merged team we'll be looking o rapidly rollout the learning from Chicago into other relevant markets.", "From a digital standpoint David, obviously we continue to see really positive response to some of our efforts like cartwheel and cartwheel has now been downloaded over 18 million times. And every time I am in-stores I run into guests that have their smartphone in their hand and they're looking for their offers from cartwheel, but we also recognized that Target is a brand that is talked about in social media everyday thousands of times every day. So if you were to visit our headquarter here in Minneapolis just down the hall from my office we have what we call guest central, it is our guest command center where we're monitoring what people are talking about, what they're blogging about, how Target is being referenced in the news and we're making sure we're very engaged with those bloggers and making sure that we're in the discussion. So it's a very important part of how we think about the brand and making sure that we incorporate social into our overall brand development initiatives.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Scott Mushkin", "Looking forward to working with you guys in your new capacity as we move forward. The stock obviously was up a lot earlier today it has kind of rolled over and I think it's the sales line that people may be a little concerned about. The 1% to 2% guidance in the third quarter but also that we'll look out over time SG&A saves obviously tapered down and so as you look out to '16 and '17 getting the sales line moving is going to be more important here. I know Brian you pointed to some things like the signature categories but I was wondering what else gives you confidence, we actually have a lot of confidence because we got a focused group that stay in touch that people are really responding to what you guys are doing. But in your words what gives you the confidence we can see sales trend higher overtime?", "Brian Cornell", "I think it starts Scott with the reaction we've seen from the guests, at some of the changes we made in signature categories. And when I think about in today's marketplace apparel growing at 4% to 5%, the changes we've seen and the reaction we've seen from the guest to our home offering. The fact that within kids, toys growing this quarter at 12% and while again still in the early stages the reaction to some of the changes we're making in our food assortment. The reaction that guests is taking to made to matter and our wellness initiatives gives me a tremendous amount of confidence that as we continue to bring great design, fashion, quality and excitement to our signature categories and combine that with the opportunity to reinvent food to bring the right assortment that meets the needs of our guests, that to me is the magic to unlock sustainable sales growth to Target and make sure we're driving traffic to our stores, more visits to our site and it gets back fundamentally Scott, I believe we win and will continue to grow by combining a great store experience the convenience of allowing our guests to order online and pick up in our stores whenever they want and also be able to ship directly to their homes and using our stores as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that response is a quick one. So I'm very optimistic about the future. I think you're starting to see that embedded in the results and the results in signature categories is very encouraging for us. We're getting great feedback from the guests. As I think about the third quarter we expect plan to be a really exciting initiative and the buzz that we're seeing already is really positive. So we've got work to do on food but when we reinvent food and get the assortment right there and improve the presentation I think that gives us all great confidence that we're going to continue to drive traffic to our stores and that's going to convert to really solid and sustainable comps.", "Scott Mushkin", "And maybe just, I hate to be the short term focus but the question I get all the time as we look at the fourth quarter, where you're going to be going over a pretty significant comp from last year. How should we think about that, I mean a lot of people look at stacks, you guys have good stacks, or how do you think we should start framing the fourth quarter maybe a thought there?", "John Mulligan", "I think we can all drive ourselves crazy doing two year, three year, five year stacks whatever you want, but in this case I do think the two year of stack is important. We've continued to see our two year stacks improve if you do last year's Q4 against the previous Q4 you know the average there is about or the number there is about a 1-3. So we expect to cycle past that this Q4 and we've seen putting our, putting the implied guidance you guys can do a rough number around that, putting that against last year's comp will be an acceleration of our two year stack and so we feel good about that and I think to the points Brian just made, part of it is we need to continue to grow, we feel confident we\u2019re going to continue to grow and comp against whatever it is we delivered in the prior year and we feel good about doing that, we feel great about our fourth quarter plans, we're cognizant that that's an intensely competitive time of year, we'll be very promotional, we're not going to get beat on promotions and we'll be in the game and we feel really good about what we'll offer the guests in Q4.", "Brian Cornell", "And Scott honestly, we'll update our guidance for the fourth quarter at a later date, but trust me we're spending a tremendous amount of time evaluating our plans week by week in the fourth quarter. I spent time just yesterday with our team going through our fourth quarter plans, our merchandizing plans, our marketing plans, how we\u2019re going to approach the key holiday periods. And to me it's all about making sure we've got the right content, we have got to have great product. We certainly know we need to make sure we're winning from a promotional standpoint but then we got to make sure we surround the guest with a great experience and really iconic marketing. And I think we're going to combine a great in store with an online experience and be very competitive and well prepared for the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.", "Matt McClintock", "I was just wondering if we could focus just, I know we focused on, you have talked a lot about the signature categories, you have talked a lot about supply chain but could we focus on, and you've also talked about food can you focus a little bit on electronics continued weakness there clearly the industry itself is a little bit challenged but a lot of consumer interest in new products in that category especially as we go into the holiday season this upcoming holiday season you\u2019re talking about the fourth quarter maybe dive a little bit into what you\u2019re doing there in that specific category to maybe try to gain market share and what is the challenge category? Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Yes so Matt I\u2019m not going to go through the details of our plans. We\u2019ll kind of maintain that powder for the fourth quarter but we\u2019re certainly looking at newness in electronics. We\u2019re looking at categories where we think we\u2019re uniquely positioned to win, so working very closely with our suppliers to ensure that we have the right newness that we\u2019re ready with the right presentation I think there is a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. We certainly think as we continue to focus on wellness that variable technology is a space where we can and will win. But we also recognized right now that many of those categories are waiting for new innovation and we\u2019re working closely with our key suppliers to make sure that we\u2019re going to be bringing that innovation to the guest and featuring it throughout the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Two quick ones, first, on the digital side obviously impressive growth 30% I think the longer term plan closer to 40%, so curious, two things, one, what kind of gets that channel growing faster the next couple of years and related to that a number of large retailers out there are opening up dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers. I don\u2019t believe you guys have those, is that something that make sense for Target as you think out over the next few years?", "John Mulligan", "I\u2019ll take the second one first and then let Brian comment on the growth. I think on our supply chain for the digital channel we actually have six dedicated fulfillment centers and we think the combination of fulfillment centers with our exciting regional distribution centers and along with the stores gives us all of the capability we need and then you\u2019ll see us continue to grow the store channel, our regional distribution channel, all three of those channels as ways to fulfill depending on the product and how quickly the guest wants it.", "Brian Cornell", "Yes and Peter I\u2019ll step back and just talk about the fundamentals. We got to continue to make sure that we build awareness. We got to make sure that as our guest engages with us digitally we make it really easy, and we make it easy to find product and easy checkout experience. We believe that available to promise which will roll-out this fall will give our guest the confidence that they know where the product is and when it will arrive for them either in a store for them to pick up or being available directly to their home. So we\u2019re focused on making sure that we provide not only a great in-store but a great digital experience and we\u2019re going to make sure that we continue to make our site easy to work with and more and more that\u2019s the mobile interchange that we\u2019ve got to make sure is easy for our guest to find product and checkout. We want to give them the confidence that when they order they know it\u2019s available to promise and we\u2019re going to have it there for them when they need it. And to the point John made, we don\u2019t need to be building upstream DCs we\u2019re going to continue to convert more of our stores and as we go in the fourth quarter close to 450 that will act as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that we can quickly and efficiently get product to the guest. So those fundamentals are critically important as we think about driving industry leading growth.", "Peter Benedict", "Sorry, my bad on the DC question, but thank you for that. And quickly over to SG&A I think you guys have outlined 1.5 billion over the next couple of years in savings $500 million maybe coming this year where are you trending towards those savings, how are those savings kind of corporate versus in-store I\u2019m just curious kind of how like store level payroll dollars compared today versus let\u2019s say a year ago?", "John Mulligan", "Yes so, we\u2019re right on track with the savings we\u2019ve got programs identified to deliver the entirety to 2 billion to 1.5 billion in SG&A plus the cost of good saving so we feel really good about that we\u2019re on track for our commitment for this year as well. One of the things we talked about when we had first announced this and we\u2019ve talked about it in a great detail and the company is -- the stores are already productive and if we\u2019re going to take hours out of the store it will be because we eliminate work to the point Brian made earlier move work upstream into the distribution centers. And so we\u2019re not focused on taking hours out of the store. We\u2019re focused on taking work out and we are in the process of working through that, that\u2019s a little bit longer lead process than some of the other things we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019re focused on essentially freeing up those hours in the store and then we\u2019ll decide do we need them for improved guest service or how we\u2019ll utilize them. But in fact we have -- there is a couple of areas where we have invested hours back into the store as we have put in the whole merchandising sets and as we have put in mannequins we\u2019ve realized the need for dedicated store team members who can merchandise those displays and make them look great all the time. So that\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve invested back into the store.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.", "Gregory Melich", "John I can\u2019t let you get promoted without hitting with a finance question so, how much the credit helped you said credit I think was a benefit in the quarter profit share how much did that help in the quarter and linked to that how should we think about SG&A dollar growth, I mean, it sounds like third quarter will be up 1 to 2 in the comp but it was flat in the second quarter, what's the normal run rate there now?", "John Mulligan", "Good question, on the credit side the benefit it was up but not meaningful and it was less than I would say less than half a penny of improvement versus last year so very-very small we are pleased it was up given that as we said payment rates continue to go up and so we're seeing the portfolio continue to shrink, so clearly a portion of where the gas dollars are going at least from our perspective. SG&A through time, we'd expect to lever SG&A go up over the long-term here go up modestly slower than sales growth. I think we said we're going to continue to take expense out, but we also said that the majority of that expense will likely get reinvested so I wouldn't count on big reductions in our SG&A overtime there will be places where we have to add back expense to meet the needs of our guests I just talked about in the stores. So modestly slower than sales growth over the long-term would be what I\u2019d say.", "Brian Cornell", "Okay, thank you. And for all you that concludes our second quarter earnings conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 18, 2015.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President - Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Brian will discuss our third quarter performance including results across our merchandise categories and plans for the fourth quarter and remainder of the year; then John will provide an update on our operations and priorities going forward; and finally, Cathy will offer more detail on our third quarter financial performance and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Following the remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.", "Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his perspective on our third quarter performance. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. As we step back and look at our third quarter results and our year-to-date performance, it\u2019s clear that our strategy is working and we\u2019re delivering on the financial commitments we laid out last March. Following an extended period of declines, traffic has turned positive over the last four quarters and it\u2019s been accelerating on a two-year basis.", "Sales in signature categories have been growing much faster than our overall sales, and they\u2019re clearly exceeding industry benchmarks. So, while consumers continue to spend cautiously, we feel confident as we enter the holiday season. And we\u2019re focused on continuing to deliver on both our strategic priorities and our financial goals.", "As we mentioned in our last conference call, our third quarter plans were based on the knowledge that we are facing stronger prior year comparisons than we had experienced earlier in the year. Now, with the quarter behind us, I am pleased to report that not only did we meet our forecast we saw continued progress on our strategy. Specifically two-year growth trends in comp sales, traffic and signature category performances each accelerated in the third quarter, following strong performance in the second quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.86 was 8.6% higher than last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter.", "Third quarter comparable sales were up 1.9%, also near the high-end of our guidance, and driven primarily by growth in traffic. We are really pleased that our guests are responding to the investments we\u2019re making in our assortment, presentation, and shopping experience. And we\u2019re focused on building on this year\u2019s traffic increases in both, stores and our digital platforms in the quarters and years ahead.", "Our third quarter gross margin rate was down slightly to last year, reflecting the benefits of a favorable merchandising mix and the comparison over last year\u2019s intense promotional markdowns. These benefits were offset by reimbursement pressure in pharmacy combined with the impact on investments in quality and innovation on our owned and exclusive brands.", "Third quarter SG&A expenses were solid and in line with our expectation, as Cathy will cover in a few minutes. We reported a very healthy after-tax return on invested capital of 13% this quarter, nearly 2 percentage points higher than a year ago as progress on our strategic priorities has driven improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital.", "Given the stable performance, we continue to have capacity to invest in our business, while returning a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders. This quarter, we will return well over $1 billion through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to well over $3 billion so far this year.", "Consistent with our guidance, our third quarter comp sales increase was somewhat smaller than the second quarter. From a category perspective, the entire change of pace in sales was attributable to apparel and electronics. In apparel, third quarter comp sales grew just under 3% compared with nearly 5% in the second quarter. This slowdown was correlated with warm weather in September followed by a reacceleration when somewhat cooler temperatures arrived in October.", "In the electronics category, we saw a double-digit decline in the third quarter comp sales. This performance reflects the comparison over last year\u2019s most intense electronic promotions, which occurred in August and the continued softness in tablets, consistent with industry trends. One standout in electronics was wearable devices, part of the signature Wellness category, where we saw nearly 100% growth in comparable sales. Another standout was our Toy category, part of the signature Kids business, which matched its second quarter growth with another 12% comp sales increase this quarter. Beyond strength in licensed products, growth in toys was broad-based across multiple sub categories including small dolls, LEGO, action toys and board games.", "We were also pleased with third quarter results from seasonal programs, beginning with solid performance in back-to-school and back-to-college all the way through Halloween when we saw very strong increases in costumes and d\u00e9cor and solid growth in candy. And to show you why are we so excited about the upcoming Star Wars release, we had the number one market share in Star Wars when we launched it in our store back in September.", "Looking through the lens of our category roles, third quarter comp sales growth was led by signature categories which grew more than two and a half times as fast as our overall sales. And as I mentioned, given the tougher prior year comparisons, our two-year stack comps in signature categories were stronger in the third quarter than either of the first two quarters of this year.", "Beyond toys and wearable electronics, our third quarter standouts within signature included baby and kids\u2019 apparel, women\u2019s ready to wear and wellness items and food.", "In food overall, for the first time this year, third quarter comp sales growth outpaced comp sales overall as our work to reinvigorate this category is beginning to shape our performance. In key categories like yogurt where we added premium and better-for-you brands, we saw high single digit comp sales increase in the third quarter. We saw similar comp increases in craft beer and wine, reflecting our work to enhance the assortment and bring locally relevant brands to our guests.", "Looking forward, we will continue to enhance our food assortment with a focus on wellness, local relevance and seasonally appropriate items. And following the holiday season, we will begin testing changes to food shopping environment in a set of 25 remodels scheduled for the LA market along with a set of SuperTarget remodels scheduled for next year.", "Digital sales increased 20% in the third quarter, contributing about 40 basis points to our comp sales increase. While significantly outpacing the industry, this performance was well below our expectation of 30% growth which we outlined in the last call.", "As we look at the drivers of this performance, it\u2019s clear the third quarter softness in electronics was particularly impactful online. And like our stores, digital sales growth in apparel was slower during much of the quarter, correlating with the relatively warm weather across much of the country. We know that our digital investments drive engagement and sales in all of our channels. And we are pleased that our third quarter sales were near the high end of our expectations. However, we believe we have an opportunity to accelerate digital transactions by enhancing the experience on Target.com.", "Beyond our efforts to streamline the guest experience on our site, our team is rolling out multiple initiatives that we expect to drive digital traffic and sales over time. And once again, this holiday season, we expect to be offering free shipping on all digital orders. We are very pleased with the guest response to this offer a year ago and we expect it to be a key differentiator for Target again this holiday season.", "Regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled, in a store or in a guest front porch, we know the vast majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled. For example, our guests access our brands through a digital device, both in advanced hub and during their trip to one of our stores. As a result, we don\u2019t think that digital is simply a selling channel, but a critical enabler of the shopping experience in all of our channels. This has significant strategic implications, both in terms of organizational structured and the way we reward our team.", "Since I arrived last year, we have been evolving our approach to focus first on our core guests and build a total Target assortment that best serves the needs and expectations of our guest. Only after we have determined the appropriate assortment, do we plan on how to offer it to each of our selling channels. Consider efforts in signature categories. For more than a year now, we\u2019ve been investing in these categories with the expectation that they will grow most rapidly and we\u2019ve seen this play out in all of our channels. In fact, even while our digital footprint remains relatively small, we\u2019re approaching $1 billion of annual sales in our home category, making us one of the leading digital retailers in the states.", "As we look ahead to the holidays, we are excited about our merchandising and marketing plans, and we believe we\u2019ll further differentiate Target during a critical retail season. In hardlines, Toys has already turned in a terrific performance so far this year. And we expect this strength to continue throughout the fourth quarter, when we simply generate half of our annual toy sales. This year more than 15% of our toy assortment is exclusive to Target, including the exclusive BB-8 Droid from the upcoming Star Wars movie which we expect to be a top seller. We\u2019re also bringing back our Kids\u2019 Wish List back, this year with enhanced features to make it easy and fun for family and friends to shop for the perfect gift for every kid in their life. Our gift catalog featuring more than 700 items was distributed to 40 million guests this year through direct mail, newspaper and distribution in our stores.", "On Cartwheel, we\u2019re seeing great results from our daily toy deal, which is featuring a different toy at 50% off every day through December 24th. And finally, we\u2019re bringing everything together on our kids gifting hub on Target.com, which is designed to make shopping easy for parents and gift givers while create a destination as fun and inspirational for kids.", "In electronics, we\u2019re excited to be one of the few retailers offering the Apple Watch in stores this season. And we expect this item to be a top gift item in wearable categories. Also in wearables, we partnered with UNICEF to offer their kids our band, which encourages kids to get more active, and based on the point they accumulate, improve the lives of kids around the world. We also expect drones [ph] to be a big hit this season. So, we\u2019re featuring nearly 20 in-store, and about four times as many online.", "We\u2019re planning for a big season in video games, a key gifting category where hardware prices continue to moderate and software libraries continue to grow. And in entertainment, where we\u2019re very excited to be featuring a Target exclusive version of Adele\u2019s new 25 release that features three bonus tacks available, only at Target.", "As we enter the holiday season, about 1,400 of our stores are featuring mannequins in apparel, which is around double the number we had a year ago. Also this year we\u2019ve enhanced the shopping experience by updating presentations in home and electronics, in more than 200 additional stores for each group. So, we feel great about the ability of our stores to showcase our assortment. And this year when our guests shop at Target for the holidays, they\u2019ll find assortment focused on three key things, entertaining; decorating; and gifting.", "To support each of these themes, we\u2019ve invested in quality and differentiation, featuring real marble, hand carved wood, copper accent and genuine leather. In fact, more than 20% of our holiday gifting items are handcrafted this year.", "In food, we\u2019re highlighting exclusive brands and flavors, including Republic of Wine, our new exclusive brand which features unique discoveries from around the world. We\u2019re rolling out classic holiday and flavors in Archer Farms and we\u2019re offering exclusive indulgent seasonal flavors from great natural brand partners with M&M\u2019s Hershey\u2019s, Dove and Ghirardelli. And finally, anticipation\u2019s building for Black Friday, which is just over a week away. Once again, this year, we\u2019re opening our stores at 6:00 pm on Thanksgiving and our team is already preparing to deliver a combination of great deals and a shopping experience that makes Target different from everyone else. But we\u2019re committed to offering compelling savings, value beyond the traditional Black Friday event. Beginning this Sunday, we\u2019ll launch 10 days of deals on electronics, kitchenware, toys and more which will run through Tuesday, December 1st. This Sunday\u2019s Weekly Ad, we\u2019ll also revel special deals from our Black Friday presale, which takes place on Wednesday, November 2015.", "For our guests who prefer to shop digitally, all of our Black Friday deals will be offered on Target.com. And finally, guests who spend $75 or more on Friday, November 27th, will receive a voucher for 20% off on future purchases, redeemable from December 4th through the 13th.", "Last March, in our meeting with the financial community, we outlined our plan to grow profitably by focusing on a set of key enterprise priorities. And, while we have much more work to do, we remain committed to that plan, and our pleased with our progress so far.", "Through the first three quarters of 2015, we have successfully grown traffic, sales and profits, a bit faster than we originally expected by focusing on our core guests and providing them with differentiated assortment and the experience they expect and deserve. But we\u2019re not slowing down, because we see enormous opportunity still ahead of us. We are going to continue to focus on elevating the assortment, quality and the presentation in our signature categories. Across every category, we will differentiate Target assortment by providing exclusive items from both our national branded partners and one of a kind items from our outstanding product, design and development team. And while we\u2019re encouraged with the recent acceleration in food sales, we are still in a very early stages of our work to provide a unique assortment of fresh, local and healthy items to our guests.", "And finally, while I\u2019m pleased we\u2019ve already made early progress in our efforts to improve our in-stock performance, I believe we\u2019ve got a multiyear opportunity to improve our reliability, both in-stores and in digital channels by modernizing way we work and refocusing on retail fundamentals.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Mulligan, who will discuss this team\u2019s early efforts to improve operations as well as John\u2019s priorities going forward. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks, Brain. Good morning, everyone.", "Today, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our initial efforts to reinforce our retail fundamentals, particularly our in-stock position, and I\u2019ll cover our priorities and progress in our work to modernize the supply chain in support of our strategic initiatives.", "The good news is that while we have lots of work still ahead of us, we have seen meaningful improvement in key in-stock measures based on changes we\u2019ve made in the last few months. While we stride to be in-stock on every item, in every store throughout every day, we know that need-based commodity categories are the most critical. If our guests don\u2019t believe that they can rely on Target to have their shopping list items available every time they shop, they will begin to skip some trips to Target, even though they enjoy shopping our more discretionary categories. As a result, when in-stock metrics on our core commodity categories began deteriorating this year, we created an out of stock action team to conduct deep dives by category to identify both, short-term and long-term solutions.", "When the team identifies solutions within a category, we can quickly test them to confirm they improve our performance and then determine if those solutions can be applied more broadly. This team focused first on our household, personal, baby category and more recently, they\u2019ve done work on our center store grocery category. In a short amount of time, they\u2019ve identified opportunities related to the way we generate vendor orders, optimize tradeoffs between order quantities and frequency and our reliance on system generated solutions versus manual processes. In high-volume stores, the team has implemented adjustments to planograms to enhance holding capacity on fast turning SKUs, reducing the need for frequent store replenishment. And in our distribution centers, the team has identified opportunities to reduce lead-time variability, tighten delivery windows, and in some cases increase safety stock on key items. I should note that this increase in safety stock is one of the drivers of the 4% inventory growth we reported at the end of the quarter.", "In a very short-time, the results of our efforts have been encouraging. In household, personal, baby, we\u2019ve been able to reduce overall out of stock measures by approximately 50% in about eight weeks. In centers for grocery, in less than a month, the team was able to reduce out of stock measures by about 25%. And importantly, we\u2019ve been able to reduce out of stock even further on the items most important to our guests.", "Given these encouraging initial results, the team is moving quickly to scale these solutions to a broader set of categories throughout the store, and conducting additional deep dives in categories like health and beauty.", "Looking ahead, the team has a number of key priorities, including work to optimize case packs, which will better accommodate variability in store sales volume across our network. In addition, they are implementing technology and process improvement to improve count integrity throughout our stores and distribution network. Included in these efforts will be a test of RFID technology in a few of our apparel categories to gauge the effectiveness of the technology relative to the cost of implementation. This work has been supported by the rollout of an agile technology development in partnership with Mike McNamara, our new Chief Information Officer and our newly hired Senior Vice President of Operational Excellence, Anu Gupta. We are very excited to have Anu on the team. She has more than 20 years of relevant experience in driving operational excellence by leveraging best practices in a variety of operating models including procurement and lean six sigma process redesign across the range of industries including retail. We are confident Anu will accelerate the efforts of the outstanding team we already have in place.", "Beyond our work to improve reliability, our store teams are working diligently to support Target\u2019s efforts to become more flexible in the way we fulfill guest demand. As a result of last year\u2019s rollout of ship-from-store capability, stores have already shipped more than 10 million items directly to guests so far this year. And the percent of digital orders delivered in a three-day window has more than doubled compared with a year ago. To showcase this improvement in our capabilities, last quarter we rolled out new functionality, we call available-to-promise, which offers guests a more precise shipping window. With available-to-promise, we expect nearly two-thirds of our digital orders will offer our guests a delivery window of three business days or fewer compared with our typical window of four to seven business days, prior to the rollout. We recently expanded our ship-from-store capability to more than 300 additional stores, bringing the total to more than a quarter of the chain. This will enable about 40% of digital transactions to be shipped from our stores in the fourth quarter. In addition, two new direct-to-guest fulfillment centers became operational in the third quarter, in advance of the holiday season. With the expanded capacity these changes provide, we expect to continue making progress on shipping speed next year.", "As Brian mentioned, most of our store sales are digitally enabled, so we continue to integrate digital experiences into the stores. Guest increasingly use Cartwheel, a digital savings app with more than 20 million authenticated users to plan their store chips in advance and then use the app to search for additional deals while shopping in store. In addition, because 10% to 15% of our digital orders are picked up in stores, we\u2019re exploring ways to streamline the pickup process by expanding holding capacity at the service counter and implementing process improvements to reduce wait times. For next year\u2019s LA25 remodels, we will feature all of latest merchandising enhancements. We will test changes to the frontend that will make order pickup even more convenient, including dedicated investors to help store guests better understand Target\u2019s digital capabilities.", "Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I want to thank our store and distribution center teams for their great performance so far this year and for their current efforts to ensure we provide an outstanding guest experience this holiday season. It\u2019s an enormous challenge for both our stores and distribution teams to accommodate the surge in volumes we see at Black Friday. But our store teams don\u2019t focus only on moving merchandise. They focus first on our guests and do an amazing amount of preparation to ensure guests have a pleasant and safe experience. It\u2019s one of the many things that makes Target unique and one of the reasons why guests love our stores and our brand.", "With that, I will turn it over Cathy who will share her insights on our third quarter financial performance, and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?", "Cathy Smith", "Thanks, John. And hello, everyone.", "As Brian mentioned earlier, we\u2019re pleased that this quarter\u2019s performance was near the high-end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS. As is often the case, when you get into the detailed P&L, there were some ins and outs within the quarter that generally offset each other, which I\u2019ll cover in a few minutes.", "This quarter adjusted EPS was $0.86, above the midpoint of our guidance range and 8.6% above last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.76, $0.10 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.05 of asset-impairments, $0.03 of data breach expense, and $0.02 related to the corporate restructuring we announced last spring. Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.87 compared with the $0.55 a year ago, as this year we recognized $0.11 of tax benefits related to our investment losses in Canada, while last year we incurred $0.27 of after-tax losses related to Canadian operations.", "Let\u2019s turn to third quarter segment results. Among the drivers of our 1.9% comparable sales growth, we are pleased that traffic grew a very healthy 1.4% in the third quarter. This growth is even more encouraging when we look at performance on a two-year basis, as we faced a tougher comparison in the third quarter than either of the first two quarters of the year. October marked our 12th straight month of traffic growth. And we are laser focused on his metric as a key indicator of the health of our business over time.", "Breaking out our sales growth between stores and our digital platforms, the stores accounted for a little over three quarters of our comparable sales growth while digital contributed about 40 basis points to our third quarter comp. Consistent with results from earlier in the year, our digital growth continues to be driven by a meaningful improvement in conversion. And although we have seen an acceleration in the last two months, we haven\u2019t seen a growth in digital traffic we expected to see this year. We believe our biggest opportunity to drive traffic continues to be our work to streamline and enhance the digital experience.", "Third quarter REDcard penetration was 22.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago. And we remain on track to meet our guidance for an increase of 100 basis points or more for the full-year. As you\u2019ll recall, we tested REDcard rewards in the Kansas City market for a year, before we launched the program nationwide. With the benefit of that head start, penetration in Kansas City continues to run well ahead of the rest of the country, giving us confidence that we have continued room to grow this rewards program in the years ahead.", "In addition, we are optimistic that the industry\u2019s move to EMV or Chip-and-PIN technology will help restore confidence in the U.S. payment system and increase the willingness of consumers to add new cards to their wallets. Regarding our move to EMV, we are pleased to be one of only a few large retailers in the United States that are accepting chip cards for both credit and debit transactions in advance of this holiday season. We\u2019ve already reissued chip cards to about half of our Target branded debit and credit card holders. And we expect to complete the rollout early next year, following a pause for the holiday season.", "Our third quarter segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were both about 20 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our guidance as strong SG&A performance offset the impact of a lower than expected gross margin rate.", "On the gross margin line, third quarter performance was about 10 basis points below last year, short of our expectations. While we continue to benefit from the comparison to last year\u2019s promotions, the benefit is waning as the intensity of those promotions began to taper in the third quarter of last year. In addition consistent with results from earlier in the year, we are seeing continued margin pressure from quality investments in our owned and exclusive brands. Finally, this quarter, we saw a reimbursement pressure in our pharmacy business which we expect to continue until we complete the sale of this business to CVS.", "I want to pause for a moment and comment on the CVS transaction. We continue to work closely with the CVS team to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction. And while we don\u2019t have an update on the potential timing for the transaction to close, we are pleased with our progress to-date.", "Turning back to the third quarter P&L, on the SG&A expense line, we saw unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter, about 30 basis points lower than last year. As part of our efforts to control cost, this quarter\u2019s expense rate benefitted from the discontinuation of an outdated little used retiree medical plan but we also saw discipline across the organization which drove outstanding underlying performance. Even on the marketing line, where some expenses were retimed into the third quarter from the second quarter last year, we recognized savings in other programs that led to overall favorability compared with last year.", "As John mentioned and consistent with last quarter, our inventory position at the end of the third quarter was about 4% above last year. This reflects a significant improvement from the higher year-over-year increases we were seeing earlier this year. And while inventory growth is slightly higher than our pace of sales, it reflects changes in receipt timing compared with last year, combined with the intentional investments we are making in commodity categories to improve our in-stock position. As a result, we feel very good about our inventory position going into the holiday season in relation to both our sales planned and our work to improve in-stock reliability.", "Turning back to consolidated metrics, third quarter interest expense was a $151 million, $5 million higher than last year. Our third quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 34.3%, up from 30.6% last year when we recognized a $30 million benefit from the resolution of tax matters.", "We paid third quarter dividends of $352 million, up about 7% from last year. And given our cash position and continued strong business results, we have the opportunity to invest another $924 million in share repurchase this quarter.", "Given our long ranged plan to generate profitable growth, we believe the continued opportunity to retire shares will prove to be a productive use of cash. To illustrate that point, under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we have retired more than 77 million shares, representing more than 12% of our current shares outstanding at an average price of less than $69.", "As Brian mentioned our after tax return on invested capital or ROIC was a very healthy 13% for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter. This is nearly 2 percentage points higher than last year when our business results were under pressure following the data breach. Given our plan to generate profitable growth on a relatively stable base of invested capital, we expect to continue to grow this metric over time with a goal to reach the mid teens or higher in the next five years. ", "Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter and what that guidance implies for our expected full year performance. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we are mindful that the consumer remains cautious, and there are indications that heavy inventory levels at some competitors. However, we remain focused on the things we can control and what has been working all year. These include our ability to deliver on our expect more, pay less brand promise by offering great products at a compelling value, iconic marketing that guests love, and an outstanding store experience that differentiates Target from everyone else.", "With that context, we expect to deliver a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, consistent with our third quarter guidance. Underlying that guidance, we expect digital growth of about 20%, consistent with our third quarter performance.", "Before I move down -- further down the Q4 P&L, I want to pause and discuss a challenge we hear a lot, which is based on the acceleration in two-year stacked performance we are planning for the fourth quarter.", "John answered this question last call but I think it\u2019s worth addressing in more detail today. Last year, our fourth quarter comparable sales growth was 3.8% but that was on top of a 2.5% sales decline in the fourth quarter 2013, when we announced the data breach on the weekend before Christmas. So while the analysis of multiyear sales performance isn\u2019t always useful, I think in this case, it\u2019s important to think about a three-year stack of our comp sales. Specifically, if we hit the midpoint of our fourth quarter sales guidance, the simple three-year stack would be a 2.8% comp, slightly less than the 3%, three-year stack we\u2019ve delivered year-to-date. So, while there are always risks to every sales forecast, we don\u2019t believe the two-year stack provides useful insight in this case.", "Moving back to the P&L, we expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate to be flat to down slightly from last year\u2019s 9.8% rate. Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect moderate gross margin rate decline to be offset by a similar improvement in our SG&A expense rate, this quarter. We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be consistent with our third quarter and our tax rate is expected to be approximately 34%, as we annualize over last year\u2019s favorable resolution of tax matters. With our current cash position and expected business results, we\u2019ve planned to continue repurchasing our shares this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to manage the magnitude and pace of repurchase activity with the goal of maintaining our current investment grade ratings. Altogether, this performance would lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.48 to $1.58 compared with a $1.49 in fourth quarter 2014.", "Let\u2019s look at what this guidance implies for our expectations for full year 2015 financial performance, which I\u2019ll compare to the guidance we provided at our financial community meeting last March. At that meeting, we laid out an expectation for 2015 comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Given our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect our full year comps to remain firmly in that range. I would note that the channel mix of our sales has been different than expectations. Specifically with year-to-date digitals sales growth of 29% and our expected 20% growth in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s clear that in 2015, we don\u2019t expect to attain the longer term 40% goal we laid out in March. However, we\u2019ve delivered on our overall comparable sales goal every quarter this year and we still expect to deliver industry leading digital sales growth, both important benchmarks for us.", "In March, we laid out an expectation to grow our segment EBITDA margin rate by 20 to 30 basis points for the year, and we\u2019re on track to outperform that expectation with growth closer to 40 to 50 basis points in 2015. Regarding capital deployment, we are on track to meet our guidance for 5% to 10% dividend growth this year, and we\u2019ve already met our goal for $2 billion or more in share repurchases through the first three quarters of the year. And finally, we told you in March that we expected to generate $4.45 to $4.65 in adjusted EPS for the year. And despite a challenging backdrop with our updated guidance today, we\u2019re positioned to deliver performance at the high end or above that range for the year.", "Beyond my love for the brand, I was attracted to Target because of our singular focus on delighting our guests and our tremendous desire to win. It\u2019s evidenced across our stores, online team, distribution centers and headquarters. I recently visited one of our stores and had the opportunity to meet Bev who has been with the Company for an amazing 44 years. In her current role, Bev is involved and they ship-from-store process and she says their whole team loves this new capability because it allows our stores to drive sales by serving guests in new ways.", "Now that I\u2019ve been emerged in our business for the past three months, I\u2019m mindful of the opportunity ahead of us and the work we still need to do to accomplish. But I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve seen already. Traffic has increased for a full year; signature categories are leading our sales every quarter and with a renewed focus on retail fundamentals and the dedication of team members like Bev, we are delivering on our vision to provide shopping on demand while maintaining our focus on everyday in-stock reliability across our store network. The ultimate measure of this year\u2019s accomplishment can be seen in our earnings. We\u2019ve delivered a 16.9% increase in our adjusted earnings per share so far this year. And with our fourth quarter guidance, we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver double-digit growth for the year. We\u2019re excited about this initial progress and we remain laser focused on building on this momentum over time.", "With that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Brain, John, and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer", "First, Brain, I\u2019m hoping that we can get a little bit of a pulse of the consumer from you. Clearly there\u2019s been some weather impact in September and October but we\u2019re hearing negative comments about November from another -- a number of retailers. So, it feels like there\u2019s something else happening either from a macro or maybe a competitive standpoint. I\u2019d love to get your sense for what you\u2019re hearing from your customers or guests?", "Brain Cornell", "Matt, I\u2019d tell you, we\u2019re feeling really good about the trends we\u2019re seeing, the reaction we\u2019re getting from the guests. Certainly the growth in traffic for us is really encouraging. So, we\u2019re seeing more Target guests come back to our stores and visit our sites. And they are continuing to respond very positively to the work we\u2019ve done in signature categories. So, sitting here today, we are very confident about our position. We think we are connecting with the consumer and our guest. And I feel fantastic about the plans we have in place for the fourth quarter. So, while obviously still cautious, as we sit here early in November, we feel very good about the way the consumer and the guest is responding to our brand. And I feel as if we are really well-positioned for the fourth quarter.", "Matt Nemer", "That\u2019s great to hear. And then just shifting gears to gross margins. I\u2019m wondering if you can call out the impact of the reimbursement pressure in healthcare and any sense for the total impact or a run rate impact following the closure of your deal with CVS, how that could help you next year? And then secondly on gross margin, you did call out in the press release private brand investments. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could dimensionalize the potential size of that over the next few years? Thanks.", "Brian Cornell", "Let me talk about the owned brand investments we\u2019re making and then let Cathy talk through the RX implications. But, as we have consistently talked about throughout the last year and year and a half now, we think one of the things that differentiates Target is the value; the quality of the innovation we bring to our own brands. So, we\u2019re clearly looking to make sure we bring more value to our owned brands. I talked about the number of handcrafted items we are going to have for the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re being very surgical with those investments. But we\u2019re seeing a great reaction from the guest as we elevate the value we offer in our owned brands. So, we\u2019ll be very surgical, very selective but we\u2019re certainly seeing a great return through the investments we\u2019re making.", "Cathy Smith", "With regards to the pharmacy reimbursement pressure, as we said when we announced the transaction with CVS that we lack scale and we knew that we are going to continue to see pressure here over time. So, what we\u2019re seeing in this quarter is in the range of 15 to 20 basis points of pressure in the quarter and which is why we are excited to be partnering with CVS because they will be able to help with that scale.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Schick from Stifel. ", "David Schick", "Wonder if you could give us any extra color or update on the localization work in Chicago?", "Brian Cornell", "Right now, we are still very focused on testing localization in Chicago; we\u2019re very pleased with the results. And certainly, a lot of the localization\u2019s taking place in our food and beverage offerings; we\u2019re seeing the guests respond to that. And we are going to take the learning from Chicago and apply it to the 25 stores we\u2019re remodeling in Los Angeles. So, we will continue to expand the learning, take it from Chicago to LA. But I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. And we\u2019re partnering with John and the store and supply chain teams to make sure over time we can scale the learning from Chicago and Los Angeles to multiple markets around the country.", "David Schick", "So last time you had updated us, I think you said 100 to 200 basis-point comp lift. Does the very pleased sort of mean it\u2019s we\u2019re continuing to see that? ", "Brian Cornell", "We are consistently seeing those kinds of returns.", "David Schick", "Got it. And then quick on the dotcom side of the business. There was some deceleration and still good growth in that line. Can you talk about any other metrics that help us understand the shift; is it time spent on the site, capabilities, what is driving the difference in the growth rate? And it sounds like a growth rate you are comfortable with for next quarter.", "Brian Cornell", "I think the most important measure to look at is what\u2019s happening with online growth overall. And just in last 24 hours, we saw the October e-commerce growth rates in the U.S. and it was up about 8.6%. The outlook that NRF has for e-commerce growth in the fourth quarter is somewhere between 6% and 8%. So, while our 20% growth rate is not in line with our expectations, it\u2019s still dramatically outperforming the industry. And I think the most important measure we are looking at is the fact that over 80% of our guests start their shopping journey online, either at home on their desktop or via the mobile device. And that digitally influenced guest is coming into our stores more often.", "So, as we\u2019ve talked about our strategy, our strategy is to make sure we allow our guests to shop anywhere anytime they want with Target. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is they\u2019re voting with their feet to spend more time in our stores. They are downloading our Cartwheel app; I think 20 million downloads so far to-date. So, I think we\u2019re seeing an overall slowdown in digital growth across retail, and we\u2019re really pleased that we continue to outpace the industry, dramatically outpace the industry but our digital efforts are driving more traffic into our stores and helping us grow our overall comp. So, while there has been a slowdown broadly across the sector, we continue to outpace the industry and that\u2019s our fundamental goal.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kate McShane from Citi Research.", "Kate McShane", "It\u2019s encouraging to hear that a lot of the investments especially in the signature categories are panning out well for you. In your merchandising strategies specifically, where do you think you still have the most work to do, and what can we expect year-over-year when we see those categories for holiday?", "Brian Cornell", "I think we\u2019re making some very good strides starting in apparel. And while 3% in Q3 was slightly less than the growth rate we saw in the second quarter, compared to many of our peers, we recognized that we\u2019re continuing to build traffic and growth in an important apparel category. So, the work we\u2019ve done with mannequins, with changing the in-store experience clearly paying off. One of the changes that we\u2019ve announced recently is the addition of 1,400 visual merchandisers to make sure we combine the changes that we\u2019re ranking with mannequins and fixtures and layouts with experts in-store that can maintain that great in store merchandising experience. So that\u2019s a new venture for us; we\u2019re standing it up for the holidays; we expect that to continue to strengthen the in-store experience.", "And we know with our signature categories, we\u2019re still at the very, very early stages of standing up our wellness position. But we feel like we\u2019re in an excellent position with baby and kids, feel very good about our performance in the third quarter with kids apparel, certainly toys has been a highlight throughout the year, and we feel as if we\u2019re well-positioned coming off of second and third quarter comps in toys that were up 12%. The reaction we\u2019ve seen from the guests to our Star Wars assortment where we captured an industry-leading position and expect to be a destination during the holidays. So, while we still have much more work to do, we feel very good about the progress we\u2019re making in signature categories. And I think the addition of visual merchandisers, in-store, will help us maintain our merchandising appeal throughout the holidays.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.", "Scott Mushkin", "So, I wanted to get back into the food discussion, if we could, and I think you\u2019re testing stuff in Chicago; you\u2019re going to roll that into LA. Brian, maybe a lot of people don\u2019t know this, maybe they do, but you had a good experience back when you were at Safeway and then onto Sam\u2019s, I think you\u2019ve talked about 200 basis points you were initially seeing. But what can we expect out of the Company? I think Safeway saw more than that as they kind of brought in some kind of refurbishments. And when can we expect to see more from Target, as far as refreshing the d\u00e9cor and maybe doing a fuller rollout; and is 200 basis points a good expectation? It seems to me it could actually be higher than that as you refine your lift, but wanted to get some more details there.", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, I am glad you asked the question. I do think one of our highlights in Q3 was the improved performance in food. I was actually seeing food comp acceleration throughout the year. And while we haven\u2019t made major changes with fixtures and in-store d\u00e9cor, we\u2019ve been very focused on assortment changes and bringing more natural, organic local items into many of our categories, and we\u2019re seeing the guest react very favorably. So, to me, it\u2019s getting the basics right. And before we start making fixture changes and d\u00e9cor changes, it has to start with the right assortment, and making sure we have the items, the brands our guest is looking for when they shop food at Target.", "So, the acceleration you\u2019re seeing right now is driven by section-by-section getting the assortment right, bringing more appealing items to our guests, adding more natural organic gluten-free items that are on trend to those categories. We made some significant changes in yogurt in the third quarter and saw very, very positive responses, high single-digit growth rates in those categories. So, while we\u2019re not shouting about it, we\u2019re making steady progress in food. We\u2019ll learn a lot more in 25 stores in Los Angeles where you will see some changes in fixtures and d\u00e9cor. And as we learn, we will continue to grow. So, I think we do have significant upside. But, Scott, this is about making sure, we get it right. And we\u2019re going to take a slow steady approach, solid consistent results every quarter, and continue to deliver what the guest is looking for from an assortment and experience standpoint, when they shop food at Target.", "Scott Mushkin", "So, I mean obviously key, I think Cathy said you\u2019re measuring one of the big things you look at as frequency, and this is obviously a core to that, so we look forward to seeing more. But, my follow-up question is on the investment side. We get it a lot whether it\u2019d be e-commerce, whether we\u2019d be in the food, in the logistics. Can you talk us through why there won\u2019t be a massive ramp up in investment, as we go out the next couple years and that you have enough money in the CapEx and then kind of SG&A to kind of handle what the Company needs to do?", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, we\u2019ve looked at this very carefully. And I know we\u2019ve talked about it at a number of times. We feel very confident that the CapEx budgets we\u2019ve had in place will be very adequate over time to make the changes we need to make from a technology standpoint, a supply chain standpoint, continue to refresh our stores, and maintain our focus on maintenance investments. So, sitting here, Cathy and I spent a lot of time recently. Obviously John has been a great steward of our CapEx spending. And we feel very comfortable that our current spending levels will allow us to modernize the organization, enhance technology, improve supply chain, and make sure we are on the way we are continuing to enhance the in-store experience and match that up with a great online experience for our guest.", "Cathy Smith", "I would offer just real quickly to add to that, because we have kind of pressure tested this one ourselves a lot. We have not -- Target has not underinvested over the years. And I think that bodes will with the state of where you find our stores as well as our technology and supply chain investments we need. So, I feel very good about where we are. And with that level of investment, we have been pretty consistent.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "I would like to ask a two-part question, the first relates to the cost cutting initiatives that you discussed at your analyst meeting earlier in the year. You spoke about the $1.5 billion in SG&A and $0.5 billion on cost of goods over two years. If you could talk about the run rate that you are at now against those goals. And I guess another twist on Scott\u2019s question, the degree to which you\u2019ve had investments inside that would offset some of those; I think that was also part of the plan that you set forth?", "John Mulligan", "So, I will jump in and take that. I think from a tracking perspective what we said, right to your point, $1.5 billion of SG&A, $0.5 billion of margin, and we would deliver in 2015 about $0.5 billion of that. We are running a little bit ahead of that pace and both in the cost of goods and in the SG&A space, both are running perhaps a little bit ahead of what we envisioned going into the year. So we feel really good about that.", "I think stepping back and kind of tying this back to Scott\u2019s question, the other thing we said at the time was we are taking $2 billion out of the P&L but we didn\u2019t expect EBITDA margin expansion. And our view was that we would need this to fuel the investments, exactly some of the expense investments that perhaps Scott was referring to, and this would provide the capacity to do that. And that is in fact what we are seeing. We are seeing greatest discipline across the corporation but where we needed to invest we have had the capacity to do that.", "Matthew Fassler", "If I could ask a quick follow-up. Can you talk about $0.5 billion this year; is that delivered? I know it\u2019s not been delivered to the bottom-line because there are some offsets, but is that annualized run rate achieved, or is that actual cost cuts that would have come out on a gross basis against your cost base offset by some of the investments?", "John Mulligan", "We will take out $600 million this year.", "Cathy Smith", "Yes.", "John Mulligan", "And then the part of next year will be annualization of that and part of it will be incremental.", "Matthew Fassler", "And then a very quick follow-up, on wages. Obviously Walmart made an incremental announcement since your last call. Any sense as to whether this issue is kind of bring up organically in the field as you think about hiring and you think about intrinsic wage pressure in the marketplace and how you are thinking about that relative to your plan?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes, we don\u2019t see any material change in the marketplace. Again, we have talked a lot in the past about making sure we are investing to have the best retail team. And we look at this very surgically year-after-year, market-by-market, and we think we are in a great position. And we think we are hiring terrific talent. And we are excited that we have got a great team in place as we get ready for the holidays.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich", "I guess my two questions are a bit of a follow-up, one on the last one. If you look at the fourth quarter guidance, if I am getting this right, SG&A dollars are kind of flattish. And, is that basically that cost out with the reinvestment going in? And then the nature of that question is really I think John you mentioned, 40% of digital you thought would be shipped from store in the fourth quarter. What has it been running and what does that due to the labor model?", "Cathy Smith", "I will take the first part of it. To answer your question, yes, we expected to be essentially flat, and it will be pretty much offset; we will have pluses and minuses. So, the savings we are getting, we will continue to reinvest, as we have planned. John will answer the 40% digital shipment.", "John Mulligan", "Sure Greg, 40% this quarter and it will peak a little bit higher than that actually, typically running more in the 20% to 25%. But as we peak, this is a great way for us to utilize our store assets.", "The labor model, what happens here is, actually it\u2019s quite efficient because we have dedicated teams in those stores who do the picking, do the packing, and we are just able to use them, utilize them more efficiently. So, while there is more store labor that we are using, the offset clearly comes in our shipping expense because we are much closer to the guest we are shipping to, and then on the same P&L line but it\u2019s an outstanding trade for us.", "Brian Cornell", "Greg, I think it\u2019s important as you tie out the math on the ship from store. Last year at this time, we had just over about 120 stores where we were shipping from store. As we sit here today, we are up to 462. So, we have expanded the base. We are going to leverage and swept the assets I think much more effectively. But importantly that enhanced base allows us to deliver to our guests in a much shorter timeframe. So, we would expect that to grow during the holidays. We have certainly ramped up for it. And we think that\u2019s going to provide a much better shopping experience and allow us to deliver products to our guests in a much shorter period of time.", "Greg Melich", "That\u2019s helpful. And if I could follow up, I think earlier you talked about private label penetration little bit. Could you talk about how the stronger dollar or falling raw material costs or lower fuel costs could be impacting gross margin today differently than you would have thought few quarters ago?", "Cathy Smith", "I\u2019ll answer it briefly and then anyone can chime in. We\u2019re really not seeing an impact on it in our product cost or in obviously in our margins. So, it\u2019s really been kind of non-event for us.", "Brian Cornell", "And remember, Greg, with many of those items, those are long-lead time items.", "Cathy Smith", "Yes.", "Brian Cornell", "So, we\u2019ll certainly be watching that over time. But, as we seat here today, many of those orders and deals were placed many, many months ago. So, we\u2019ll continue to monitor that over time but we certainly like our position with our own brands as we enter the holidays. And that\u2019s an important way that we differentiate.", "Well, operator, it looks like we have got time for one more call.", "Operator", "Okay. Your final question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura. ", "Bob Drbul", "Just two quick questions, the first one is on the apparel performance. You talked a little bit about margin pressure I think in private label and exclusive -- was that new to the third quarter; and how do you see that playing out in the fourth quarter? And then the second question I have is on the e-commerce business. Just give us an update on like the subscription offerings and how that\u2019s going from a fulfillment perspective as well.", "Brian Cornell", "Bob, first on ANA side, again we think the guest is responding really well to some of the changes we\u2019ve made with our own brand assortment. And the investments that we talked about today, we\u2019ve been consistently talking about for over a year now, making sure that we\u2019re reinvesting in quality, in innovation, in style, making sure that we deliver that expect more pay less brand promise. So, the guest is reacting really, really well to that. And we\u2019re going to continue to make sure that we deliver great value in our own brands. So, it shouldn\u2019t be a new phenomena; it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been very clear and transparent about. And we think it\u2019s paying off with increased traffic and growth in those core signature categories.", "So, it looks like we\u2019ve run out of time for today. I do appreciate everyone calling in. And that will conclude our third quarter earnings call. So, thank you everyone for joining us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the Target Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 24, 2016.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We apologize for the delay. We were informed that some people were having trouble accessing our webcast and we delayed in order to make sure that they could access this call along with everyone else. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance including results across our merchandise categories. Then John will provide an update on our efforts to improve in-stocks and build our supply-chain capabilities, and finally Cathy will offer more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also, in these remarks we refer to adjusted earnings per share which is a non-GAAP financial measure. And return on invested capital which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "Finally, one note. Given that we're hosting our financial community meeting next week, our remarks today will focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016. At next week's meeting, we will provide insights into our strategy and priorities and how they will drive our financial performance in 2016 and beyond. As a result, we are shortening today's call to 45 minutes and we'll look forward to spending another couple hours with all of you either online or in person at next week's meeting in New York.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the fourth quarter and the holiday season. Brian?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we look back at both the fourth quarter and the year, we are very pleased with the progress we made throughout 2015. Traffic increased in all four quarters and the team delivered on our comparable sales and operating margin rate goals by driving rapid growth in our signature categories. And our full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 was above the top of the range we provided last March, keeping us on track to deliver our longer-term financial goals.", "In the fourth quarter, our business generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up $0.03 from a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Comp sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter, building on a 3.8% increase in last year's fourth quarter. Target's great store experience, unique items at an unbeatable value, and broad simple promotions resonated with our guests and drove this growth. Transactions, our measure of traffic, increased for the fifth quarter in a row, up 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all of our selling channels.", "Digital sales increased an industry-leading 34% in the fourth quarter, on top of 36% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks drove this increase. In fact, after setting a new digital daily sales record in the week of Black Friday, we shattered all previous records on Cyber Monday. Our offer was broad and simple, 15% off everything on our site. And the guest response was exceptionally strong. Our holiday season merchandising and marketing plans were focused on delivering broad, simple and compelling offers like our 10 Days of Deals, Black Friday doorbusters and the site wide offer on Cyber Monday, and the bounce back coupon we offered to guests in our stores on Black Friday, all supported by cohesive marketing plans featuring outstanding creative work.", "This plan delivered record sales over the November and December period, driven by comp sales in our signature categories: style, baby, kids and wellness, which grew nearly 7% over that two-month period. Sales in kids were particularly strong with the fastest growth in toys and kids home products. In style, we saw the fastest growth in women's apparel, led by double-digit increases in ready-to-wear. And in wellness, wearable electronics and food led the way.", "Across our traditional category designations, apparel grew in the low-single digit range. In hardlines, toys grew comp sales more than 10% in the quarter, marking the third quarter of double-digit comp growth in toys. This strength helped offset a sales decline in electronics, where sales benefited from robust growth in wearables, but also reflected the impact of industry-wide softness in tablets. Consistent with the third quarter, fourth quarter comp sales in food grew faster than our overall sales, outpacing trends in the first half of the year, validating the changes we're making to the assortment, presentation and freshness. And finally, home grew about 4% in the fourth quarter. With this performance, home delivered a 4% comp sales increase for the full year, the strongest annual performance in this category in more than 10 years.", "Finally, prior to the holiday season, we reimagined the See Spot Save area in the front of our stores, which is large and a very profitable business, and transformed it into Bullseye's Playground. We've modernized the environment, making it easier to navigate, more appealing and fun, incorporating our much-loved mascot into store displays. While we love the new look, our guest reaction is what really matters. And the fourth quarter results showed they loved it, too, as comp sales in Bullseye's Playground grew more than 25%, compared to See Spot Save in the fourth quarter of last year.", "December marked an important milestone for the company as we closed on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Our team has been working closely with our colleagues at CVS, both before and after the sale to ensure this transition is seamless for our team members and our guests. And while that transition is not yet complete, we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far. A small number of our store pharmacies have already been rebranded as CVS locations and, over the next six months, we'll complete the rebranding of all of our pharmacies and clinics in stores across the country.", "We believe this transaction will create value for our guests, providing them access to the capabilities of a best-in-class healthcare provider while they're shopping our stores. And, we expect both Target and CVS to benefit from this transaction, allowing both companies to leverage their respective strengths. Importantly, we believe CVS will be able to grow traffic in our store pharmacies faster than we would have been able to do on our own, given our lack of scale when we ran this business. In addition to the ongoing value we'd expect to realize from this arrangement, the sale has already provided more than $1 billion of net cash that we'll use in support of our capital deployment priorities.", "Turning to capital deployment, we generated very strong cash flow in 2015, which we deployed to the benefit of our shareholders. Beyond funding capital investments in support of our strategic and financial goals, in 2015, we returned nearly $5 billion through dividends and share repurchase, well ahead of the goal we set at the beginning of the year. Even with this robust return of cash, we ended this year with a very healthy cash balance, positioning Target for another strong year in 2016.", "Now, before I turn the call over to John, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for what they accomplished in 2015. As I look back to a year ago, I believe we're operating on a much stronger foundation today. And while we've got much more to accomplish on this journey, the team today is agile and aligned around a small set of key enterprise priorities, allowing us to move much more quickly. Today, the team is taking an outside-in approach to our work, understanding how Target fits into the consumer and retail environment as we work to grow the company on behalf of our guests.", "When Cathy began working with us last year, her first observation was how talented this team is, and how passionate they are about both Target and our guests. Not surprisingly, that was my first observation when I arrived at Target in 2014, and something I know John has experienced throughout his career with this great company.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's progress in efforts to improve our operations. John?", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations. And I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. Our work to reduce out-of-stocks is continuing to pay off, as metrics improved sequentially from the third quarter, and even more dramatically when compared with the fourth quarter a year ago. Specifically, for the fourth quarter in total, out-of-stock metrics were 20% better than last year and notably, by the end of the quarter, Target's out-of-stock metrics were 40% better than a year ago, as the improvements we've implemented allowed for a faster post-holiday recovery this year.", "We saw out-of-stock improvements across every category in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the last conference call, our work has been focused primarily on essential items for which reliability is particularly important for our guest, and I'm really happy with our progress. For the set of focused items we've designated in essentials, our out-of-stock metrics are better than we have ever measured. While this progress is exciting, I'm even more pleased that this improvement has been accomplished through systematic, and therefore sustainable, changes.", "In other words, this isn't an example of temporarily adding resources to work around systems and processes. Rather, this is a case of making improvements to those systems and processes to support a sustainable improvement in performance. Because upstream variability in the supply chain hampers our ability to keep our stores in stock and provide tight shipping windows to our guests, a key pillar of the team's work is focused on improving freight flow through the supply chain. As part of this effort, the team has created smart, systematic rules governing safety stock and distribution centers, and they've optimized pick frequencies on priority items.", "In the fourth quarter, the team began an array of tests to reduce variability of inbound shipments at our DCs, with a goal of reducing inbound variability by 50%. Similarly, the team plans to engage in tests to optimize outbound volatility, which will further improve overall freight flow. While we are still early in this journey, the team's work on flow was a key reason we saw a much faster recovery this holiday season, and why we entered 2016 with a much better in-stock position than a year ago.", "Beyond in-stocks, we are entering 2016 with very little clearance inventory, even compared to a strong position a year ago. As you'll recall, last year's fourth quarter sales were much stronger than expected, as we planned for a 2% comp and ended up with growth nearly twice as high.", "With last year's unexpectedly strong sales, we saw very high sell-through percentages on seasonal merchandise. However, as a result of great product and of the changes we've implemented this year, quarter-end sell-throughs on seasonal merchandise were slightly better than last year, putting us in a very clean inventory position at the beginning of the year. These are just a few examples of the team's work to implement quick solutions that are already having a tangible impact on our results.", "At the same time, we are working to build capabilities that will support our future growth. I'll provide a lot more detail on these future focused efforts in my remarks at next week's meeting.", "As you know, we have been building our flexible fulfillment capabilities for several years, and this holiday season highlighted the power of these capabilities to serve our guests and drive business performance. And while we've added capacity across our entire direct-to-guest network, our fourth quarter experience demonstrated the power of relying on our stores to fill digital demand.", "This holiday season, our stores fulfilled 30% of our digital orders through the combination of order pickup and direct-to-guest shipments. On Black Friday weekend alone, our stores fulfilled more than one million digital orders. And even though the traditional view of Cyber Monday doesn't even include brick-and-mortar, Target stores set an all-time record for order pickup on that day with more than four times the volume compared with last year. And like last year, order pickup became even more important in the days leading up to Christmas, growing to half our digital volume.", "While our stores help us save meaningfully on shipping costs and allow us to fulfill guest demand faster, they also help us capture more sales. Because we now have a single view of inventory, encompassing all of our distribution center and store locations, we can rely on our entire network when fulfilling digital orders, keeping us in-stock on a greater percentage of digital orders.", "Specifically, during the holiday season, about 40% of our order pickup and store shipped volume consisted of items that were out of stock in our web fulfillment centers. This preserved sales on orders we would have otherwise missed had we only accessed inventory in our web fulfillment centers.", "Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I also want to provide an update on our decision to bring visual merchandising talent into our stores. Last fall, we announced we were filling more than 1,400 new visual merchant positions in our store organization. In scoping responsibilities for these roles, we benchmarked industry-leaders to define the necessary capabilities and enhanced our interview process to better assess for these skills when interviewing potential candidates.", "The majority of these positions have been filled by external candidates with experience at other retailers, but we have also tapped into talent that we identified within the organization. Our visual merchants are focused on style categories in our home, apparel and seasonal areas and they are trained to rely on sales and inventory data, while developing compelling visual presentations in our stores.", "As a result, their job requires that they balance art with science and productivity with creativity. Because of their unique qualifications, this team is responsible for training their store team colleagues to understand the latest product trends so the entire store team can better assist our guests as they shop our stores.", "Although visual merchandising team is just ramping up its processes and tools, you can already see the early impact of their effort in our store displays. And we are very excited about the potential of this effort to elevate both signature categories and our store experience.", "Thinking back to the year just ended, it's amazing for me to realize that we only formed our new operations team about six months ago. In that time, we have already seen meaningful improvement in our operations and we're entering the year with a much stronger in-stock position than a year ago.", "As we look ahead, we see multiple opportunities to improve and end processes and build the foundation for our future growth while improving the shopping experience for our guests and enhancing our business results. I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you in New York next week.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our fourth quarter financial performance. Cathy?", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are really pleased that our team delivered strong traffic and sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our financial results continue to validate the strategic changes we've made, confirming that we are focused on what's most important to our guests. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 was well within our guidance range and up $0.03 from last year's very strong performance. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.31 was $0.79 above adjusted EPS, reflecting the $620 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health.", "Comparable sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter on top of a 3.8% increase in 2014. Traffic was the primary driver of our comp growth, up 1.3%, building on a really strong 3.2% increase last year. This quarter marked our fifth straight quarter of traffic growth, and we are committed to driving continued traffic growth in 2016 and beyond. As I mentioned last quarter, results in our fourth quarter 2014 reflected a bounce back from the impact of the breach in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, even on a three-year stacked basis, our traffic was stronger in this year's fourth quarter than earlier in the year, demonstrating continued momentum from the strategic changes we've implemented. One note, fourth quarter reported sales were down a little less than 1% from last year, reflecting our comp sales increase offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business which closed in mid-December.", "Digital sales grew 34% in the fourth quarter. And we saw the most dramatic increases in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks. These increases were driven by our simple, broad and compelling offers, and as John mentioned, our flexible fulfillment capabilities played a key role in driving our fourth quarter digital sales growth.", "REDcard penetration was 23% in the fourth quarter, up about 190 basis points from 21.1% last year. This increase represents a moderate acceleration from the trends we were seeing earlier in the year, combined with the impact of the removal of our pharmacy sales. Because a meaningful portion of our pharmacy sales consisted of reimbursements from third parties, REDcard penetration on our total pharmacy sales was very low. As a result, the pharmacy sale will increase REDcard penetration throughout 2016. And to add clarity, we've provided an apples-to-apples comparison in our press release schedules. For the fourth quarter, REDcard penetration would have been up about 160 basis points from last year had pharmacy sales been removed from both years.", "Our fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 9.8% was flat to last year's strong performance. Among the drivers, fourth quarter gross margin rate was down about 60 basis points from last year, reflecting a small benefit from sales mix, including the removal of pharmacy sales, offset by investments in promotions. As John mentioned earlier, last year's stronger than expected comparable sales growth drove very strong gross margin rate performance in fourth quarter 2014 as regular price selling on seasonal items was unusually high. This year, with sales in line with our expectations, our gross margin rate reverted to a more normal level, given the competitive dynamics we faced in the fourth quarter.", "Every holiday season we gain insights into the evolution of our guests' shopping behavior, and this year's results showed us that clear, compelling, broad based offers are appealing to our guests. This insight will inform our strategy as we work to further refine our promotional effectiveness in 2016.", "Favorability in our selling, general and administrative expense rate offset the fourth quarter gross margin rate decline. This performance reflected an increase in our store payroll expense rate, driven by investments in our store team, including the visual merchants, John mentioned earlier, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit productivity. However, the pressure from store labor expense was offset by favorability in our marketing and bonus expense rates and disciplined spending across the organization.", "At the end of the year, our merchandise inventory was up about 4% from a year ago, a bit more than our current sales trends. As John mentioned, we ended the year with a very clean inventory position, and the year-over-year increase reflects intentional inventory investments which are supporting record in-stock levels in our focus categories.", "Turning now to capital deployment. We paid dividends of $345 million in the fourth quarter, up 4.4% from a year ago. Our business results and cash position also enabled $1.3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, meaning we returned more than 110% of our net income through dividends and share repurchases. And, even though we returned about $4.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015, we ended the year with a healthy cash position, including cash from the CVS transaction, which closed late in the year.", "Before I turn to our guidance for the first quarter and provide some insights of our financial plan for the year, I want to review last year's performance against the guidance we provided a year ago. Let's start with sales. A year ago, we laid out a plan to grow total sales 2% to 3% on comp sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, led by growth in our signature categories. We achieved our comp sales goal by generating very solid growth of 2.1%, and comp growth in signature categories was more than two and a half times as high as our comparable sales growth overall. Total sales grew slower than comps this year, due to the removal of the pharmacy sales beginning in December.", "Of course, the sale of the pharmacy business was not reflected in our guidance a year ago, as we didn't enter into the deal until June. However, while the sale of the pharmacy business will continue to affect our total sales this year, we first articulated the expected benefits of the deal in June, which include faster traffic growth, higher profit dollars and rates, and higher ROIC from the upfront capital we received from CVS.", "Now let's turn to digital. A year ago, we laid out a goal to grow Target's digital sales an industry-leading 40% and, while we didn't quite make this ambitious goal, we did lead the industry with 31% digital sales growth in 2015. With this growth, we delivered our financial goals and we gained deeper insights into how our guests want to interact with Target. Moving down the P&L, a year ago we said we expected to grow our segment EBITDA rate 20 basis points to 30 basis points in 2015. Given \u2013 driven by modest improvements in both our gross margin and our SG&A expense rate, we ended the year ahead of that goal, up about 50 basis point points, reflecting favorability on both the gross margin and the SG&A expense lines.", "Turning to capital deployment, a year ago we were expecting 2015 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion, planning for a 5% to 10% increase in the quarterly dividend in the middle of the year, and we expected $2 billion or more in share repurchases for the full year. How did the year turn out? We spent about $1.4 billion on capital expenditures in 2015, we hit the middle of our guidance with a board-approved 7.7% dividend increase in June, and we exceeded our share repurchase guidance with about $3.4 billion in shares retired this year. Our 2015 share repurchase capacity reflected robust cash generation by our business and, of course, additional capacity from the closing of the sale of our pharmacy business in December.", "Regarding capital expenditures, our 2015 spending reflected the retiming of certain projects resulting from prioritization efforts initiated by our new Chief Information Officer, Mike McNamara and his team. Following his arrival in the middle of the year, Mike dramatically reduced the number of non-infrastructure technology projects in order to refocus resources on the highest priority initiatives and make faster progress.", "In addition, Mike's team began hiring hundreds of additional engineers in order to reduce our reliance on contractors and vendors. These changes reflect our commitment to prioritize spending on both capital and expense to best support our enterprise priorities and, in the current environment, our spending priorities are currently tilting towards expense, including investments in technology engineers, in our store team, including the hiring of visual merchants, and in our headquarters teams, in the areas of data science and operational excellence.", "So how did the elements of our 2015 P&L translate into adjusted EPS? By achieving our comp sales goal while exceeding our guidance for profit margin and share repurchase, we delivered $4.69 of adjusted EPS this year, above our guidance range of $4.45 to $4.65, and more than 11% higher than 2014. And while we didn't provide specific guidance for return on invested capital in 2015, we reported after tax ROIC of 16% this year. I'll quickly note, because the ROIC calculation doesn't adjust for nonrecurring items, this year's performance included the gain on the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding this gain, our business generated a very healthy after tax ROIC of 13.9% for the year, up well over a percentage point from 2014.", "So with full year 2015 performance as context, let's turn to our detailed guidance for first quarter. I will also provide some high level details of our plan for the year and discuss those plans in more detail at our meeting next week.", "I'll start with our view of comparable sales for the full year. We are planning for comp growth in the 1.5% to 2.5% range in 2016 consistent with our performance throughout last year. Given that we're one year into a multiyear journey, at next week's meeting, I'll discuss why we believe we have the capacity to grow comps a bit faster than this range over time. However, in the current environment, we believe this is a prudent range to plan for this next year.", "With that context on full year sales, I'll turn to the first quarter. As we plan our first quarter comp in light of competitor inventory positions, we're anticipating growth in the lower end of the 1.5% to 2.5% range we're planning for full year. First quarter reported total sales are expected to decline 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales from this year's results. One note on our sales guidance we haven't specified a goal for digital sales growth. I'll discuss our reasoning for this change in more detail next week, but for now I'll simply stress that our commitment to digital is as strong as ever. And while we will continue to include digital metrics in our financial reporting this year, we are going to gauge our success based on Target's overall traffic and sales growth without making an arbitrary distinction between channels. This change is consistent with how our guests think about shopping as we've confirmed with our guest research.", "Moving onto the first quarter P&L, on the EBITDA margin rate, we are expecting an improvement of 60 basis points to 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a moderate increase in SG&A expense rate. The expected gross margin rate improvement primarily reflects the benefit of the removal of low margin pharmacy sales from the mix combined with a moderate improvement in the underlying business. On the SG&A line, our forecast anticipates some pressure from the investments we're making in our store team along with incremental expense from the reissuance of REDcard debit and credit cards as we move guests to much more secure chip-and-pin technology.", "On the depreciation and amortization expense line, we are expecting 20 basis points to 30 basis points of pressure in first quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales and a slight increase in D&A dollars over last year. We expect first quarter interest expense dollars to be flat to last year. We're planning for a first quarter effective income tax rate of 35% to 36% and we expect to continue to engage in meaningful share repurchase given our cash position. All together, these expectations position us to deliver first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 compared with a $1.10 a year ago.", "Turning back to full year, we expect to deliver full year 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40. And I'll provide more detail on the individual P&L items next week. For now, I would note that this performance would exceed our longer term financial algorithm to generate annual adjusted EPS growth of about 10% as it reflects the expected share repurchase benefit of the incremental cash we'll deploy from the sale of our pharmacy business.", "Now, I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who is going to provide a quick preview of next week's financial community meeting. Brian?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Cathy. Before we take your questions I thought it'd be helpful to cover our agenda for next week. In New York next Wednesday, I'll open the meeting with an update on our strategic priorities and the initiatives for 2016, then John, will provide deeper insights into the work his team is doing to transform supply-chain and their efforts to drive operational excellence across the enterprise. And finally Cathy will provide insights into how we expect to continue to deliver on the long-term financial algorithm we laid out last year. Following the presentations, we'll have a Q&A session with all three speakers along with several other members of our leadership team who will be attending this meeting.", "At last year's meeting, I outlined our enterprise priorities and told you that I hoped it would remain consistent for years. So here's the spoiler alert. Our priorities today remain consistent with a year ago. We made progress but we have a lot more to do. And our tactics will always be evolving but this year's results demonstrate we're focused on the right work. At this year's meeting, we plan to show you how we're getting even closer to our guests, gaining a deeper understanding of their wants and needs and how Target fits into their daily lives.", "We also plan to show you why we're so excited about all the new products we've developed for this year. And for those of you who will be with us in New York, you'll see vignettes showcasing newly-developed products across multiple categories, including our incredible new Kids brand, Pillowfort. So whether you plan to be with us in New York next week or listening to our webcast, we hope you'll join us to gain a deeper understanding of our strategic and financial plans going forward and why we're so excited about the prospects in 2016.", "With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks. And now Cathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Can you hear me?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We can now.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you. My first question is on CVS. You had mentioned in your prepared comments that you've already converted some of the pharmacies. And I know it's early days, but wondered if you could provide any detail and if you've noticed any notable changes in traffic in those particular stores? And just how disruptive is the rebranding across the chain over the next six months?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's still very early, and we'll be tracking this carefully over the next few months. John Mulligan was actually down in the Charlotte market just a few weeks ago, where we rebranded some of the very first CVS pharmacies inside of Target. So John, why don't I let you share some of your impressions.", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think overall I don't think the rebranding will be a significant disruption for the store or the technology changes that are going to go on. As we walked the store, it looked fantastic. The CVS brand looks great. I think they've done a good job, a great job between our team and theirs, tying it into the total Target store environment. When we did this, we spoke a lot about the tools that CVS would bring not only to our guests but to our teams. The teams were certainly excited about the tools that CVS is bringing to them to help them do their jobs so that they can focus more fully on guest service. So we're very excited about that. And we're excited to see, like Brian said, as we go along later in the year, we'll see more marketing to talk about the relationship of the two companies. And also see the reaction of our guests as those capabilities are made more front and center for them as well.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd only add we've been working for months and months now with our colleagues at CVS, to make sure this is a very smooth transition. And the plans we have in place will minimize the impact on the guests. So we're very excited about what this brings to Target, what it brings to our guests and to our shareholders and expect it to be a very seamless transition over the next six months.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's great. Thank you.", "John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Go ahead, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question, a two-parter. Number one is on the promotional activity. Can you give us a sense for how much you think that impacted the sales for the quarter and how is that going to influence your promotional posture moving forward? And then the second part of my question is on some of the stats, very helpful stats that Mr. Mulligan provided on the in-stocks, how much do you think that the increase in in-stocks helped in the fourth quarter? Thank you so much.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Why don't I start by talking about the promotional environment? And we approach every year recognizing that the fourth quarter, this holiday season, is a very important time of the year for us. And it's going to be a very promotional environment. And as we sit here today, we really believe our playbook that we rolled out during the holiday drove traffic to our stores, drove traffic to our site, allowed us to accelerate our comp performance. And remember, we were comping a very strong Q4 from 2014. So we felt very good about the effectiveness of our promotions. They were broad. They very were simple, and they worked both in store and online. So we feel great about the performance during the holiday where our signature categories performed well. We've worked with Nielsen and NPD to look at market share performance and clearly recognize that we gain market share as a by-product of our playbook in the fourth quarter. So we feel very good about our approach.", "But to your question about the future, we're always stepping back and analyzing promotional effectiveness, looking back at our playbook. And as we plan for next year, we'll continue to enhance and refine and make sure that we have very broad, very simple and very effective offers that continue to drive traffic and profitably grow our sales. John, you want to talk about the impact of in-stocks?", "John J. Mulligan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think we certainly can analyze, triangulate around the sales impact of in-stocks, but that would be providing you very rough estimates. What I think is much more important, when you talk about essential categories, ultimately this is about the guests trusting that you will have the merchandise they want when they come in our stores. If a new mom takes her baby out in 10-degree weather for diapers and formula, you better have diapers and formula in your store. And so really it's about the trust that they have in the Target brand to always deliver wherever and whenever they want and over time there is no doubt in our minds that, that will drive sales growth for the long-term.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. Thank you so much.", "John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you so much, and good morning.", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I'd like to talk for a moment about the SG&A line and just to put in context the cost cuts that you announced at last year's meeting, I guess about $1.5 billion annualized, talk about where we are in recognizing those, and just thinking about the expense performance that you had against that. And as part of that, if you could address whether there's any incipient wage pressure that you've noted in the market, would be very helpful. Thank you so much.", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Go ahead.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll start out and then I'll let Cathy and John also build on it. But as we talked about last year, we've had a very clear multi-year plan. We targeted over $2 billion of savings. And in 2015, we've made very good progress against that plan. We're on or ahead of all the key metrics that we're tracking, and we expect that to continue as we go forward. So John and Cathy are working across the organization to make sure that those initiatives stay in place. And as John continues to build his team and we bring people like Anu Gupta on board to focus on operational excellence, we expect to find even greater opportunities for further improvement. So I think we're well positioned today. I feel very good about the progress we've made to drive productivity across the organization. And you should expect that to continue in 2016 and beyond.", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'll just add on a little bit. With regards to our performance with SG&A, the beauty of what we're seeing with the plan we laid out last year is, we're delivering upon it, but we're also recognizing how we can reinvest back in the business on the priorities that matter to our guest. And so if you think about our investment in visual merchandise leaders, that's a great example, 1,400 stores now have someone who is an expert at helping to showcase the categories that matter most to our guests. And so we're seeing the ability, as we save on one line, we can invest in other areas in our business.", "And you had asked about wage pressure. I'm going to just put a plug in. We believe in having the best team in retail, and that has always been a differentiator for Target, and we believe more today than ever that that is going be a differentiator. It's our wonderful team member engagement with our guests every single day, any way they interact with them. So we're going be competitive in wage. We always assess it market-by-market, because we believe in fielding that best team in retail.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI", "Hi. I just wanted ask a little more detail on the guidance, Cathy, that you outlined. If you think about all of 2016, how much buyback is there or isn't there in that guidance? And also, how should we think about CVS impacting the guidance, however you want to frame it, in terms of \u2013 you mentioned sales, but also margin, like should we expect a certain margin benefit, if it's 50 bps to 70 bps up in the first quarter, is that a good run rate for the year, or how should we think of it?", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so, Greg, thank you. First off, I'm going to put a plug in to say that we look forward to seeing you next week, because we'll obviously unpack a little bit more of it then. But with regards to the share repurchase comment, in our guidance, we did assume a consistent level of share repurchase, like we've been talking. However, we're also sitting \u2013 we're ending the year with a pretty heavy cash position, because we closed the transaction late in December. And so you'll see us provide additional color into that. But suffice it to say, it'll be at the level of this year or higher. And we've included that in our EPS guidance of $5.20 to $5.40.", "Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI", "And on the margins?", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so as we said, it obviously was an impact on sales, but very little on the aggregate EBITDA line, which is what we said longer term.", "Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI", "So your full-year guidance assumes some slight EBITDA margin increase, it seems?", "Catherine R. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah \u2013 yes.", "Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Look forward to seeing you next week.", "John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just on Q4, the gross margin was just a little bit lighter than I think consensus and we were modeled at. Could you provide just a little more detail on the variances or puts and takes in gross margin versus the internal plan that you had, or was that 50 basis point decline in line with your expectations?", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sean, as we think about our performance in the fourth quarter, it played out pretty much as expected. We know the fourth quarter is going to be very promotional, very competitive. We certainly saw the guests respond very positively to our offers, and that drove great traffic. It allowed us to build market share in our signature categories, and I think it positioned us well for 2016. So as we sit here, there's a lot of variables that go into building our plans for a quarter like the fourth quarter, but we're very pleased with the way our plans drove traffic to our stores, visits to our site, allowed us to accelerate comps on top of a very strong quarter last year. And we saw very broad increases across many of our signature categories, as we reported. So I think our plans were in line with our expectation for the quarter.", "Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Great. And then just real quick, a follow-up for just, on how you're thinking about 2016. Just from getting a number of questions about how you feel about cost of goods sold, where are you seeing any inflation or deflation potentially in some of those categories, and specifically in Food, how is that playing through on the P&L right now? Thanks.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Sean, again, a number of puts and takes as we look at the impact of changes in currency and the cost of goods. But it's all baked into our outlook for next year. And I think we approached 2016 with a lot of confidence that we've got great plans in place, terrific momentum, and as you'll see next week at the conference, the team's done a terrific job in building some exciting new brands that we'll showcase next week, and we're already seeing some really positive responses from our guests to our new kids' line Pillowfort. So we're excited about 2016, and we look forward to seeing you next week.", "With that, I guess, operator, we've got time for one last call today.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Thanks, Brian. A quick question that was, I guess, follow-up on something, the top line versus gross margin tradeoff. First, I take it you're pleased with the outcome. I recognize it's very difficult to optimize, but can you tell us maybe at least the growth you saw in digital, was that existing customers versus new? I'm trying to gauge the stickiness of some of the customers that came to you in the fourth quarter.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we're going to spend a lot more time unpacking this next week. But we recognize that today, our Target guest interfaces with the brand in a number of different ways. Sometimes they're in our store. Sometimes they're shopping online. We certainly heard many times because of some of the proprietary items that we offered during the fourth quarter, they were shopping online, but as John referenced, quickly coming to our stores to pick up those items.", "So we felt really good about the way the guests responded to our offers during the fourth quarter, and a great combination of in-store traffic, more guests than ever before, clicking and collecting items in our store. And then the fact that we were able to leverage our stores this year over 460 where we were shipping from stores to our guests' homes. That overall package came together really effectively throughout the holiday.", "So we feel as if we had a winning strategy in the holidays. It drove great comps on top of a very strong performance last year. And you and many of the others that are on the call have asked me repeatedly throughout 2015, would we be able to comp the 3.8% increase in 2014? Well, hopefully we answered that question. We answered it with strong momentum, and we were able to see both strong performance in our stores and we delivered industry-leading performance online. So we feel really good about the way we're exiting Q4, and well-positioned for 2016 and beyond.", "Brian C. Cornell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So we're looking forward to seeing all of you next week in New York. And thanks for your patience this morning. I know we started a few minutes late, but hopefully it was worth your time, and we look forward to seeing you again next Wednesday. So thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 17, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Brian will recap our second quarter performance, including results across our merchandise category. Then John will provide an update on our efforts to improve in-stocks and modernize our supply chain. And finally, Cathy will offer more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.", "Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his comments on the second quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter, but well below the results we expect to deliver over time. Against that backdrop, we reported much stronger than expected profitability. This outperformance was driven by our ongoing cost saving efforts, which benefited both our gross margin and expense rates in the second quarter. These benefits helped to offset pressure from the current promotional environment, declining comp sales, and the investments we are making in our team. I want to pause and thank our team for delivering this outstanding financial performance.", "At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are committed, first and foremost, to restoring positive comp sales growth in the quarters and years ahead. Based on the conversations with many of you, we know there is a great deal of focus on the broad macro challenges facing retailers, including a consumer focused on experiences, the impact of price deflations, and a channel shift into digital. These are real challenges, but they are not new to our business. With the right strategy and strong execution, we have demonstrated our ability to perform in the face of those challenges and our expectation is that we will continue to be a top retail performer over time.", "In the second quarter, our number one challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories. And consistent with the first quarter, we saw higher than normal variability in sales patterns. Despite these challenges, we are encouraged that we saw the strongest sales performance around key second quarter events, including Memorial Day, The Fourth of July, and the beginning of the back-to-school season.", "As we analyze the drivers to our second quarter performance, we have identified some company-specific challenges we are actively addressing. This includes meaningful pressure on electronics, where we saw a double-digit decline in comp sales this quarter, accounting for approximately 70 basis points of overall comp decline. Notably, about a third of this pressure was driven by Apple products, which are down more than 20% in the quarter. We are focused on reversing these trends and we are collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners to evolve our assortment and accelerate innovation to deliver stronger sales.", "In grocery, despite improvements in assortments, quality, freshness, presentation, and in-stocks, we were disappointed with our sales performance as we saw small comp sales decline in the second quarter. While our grocery business was negatively impacted by food deflation, which accounted for about 20 basis points of pressure, we clearly have more work to do to unlock the growth potential in this important category. Given our recent performance and the increasingly competitive food environment, we are revisiting our second half grocery efforts from presentation to assortment to promotion to improve our competitive position.", "And as I will discuss in a few minutes, we will be leveraging our learning from our LA25 remodels to help guide our plans going forward. Beyond food, we are rebalancing our messaging and promotions to ensure we continue to drive strong performance in style categories and reach consumers who are intently focused on value in this environment. Finally, we experienced soft second quarter traffic trends in the pharmacies in our stores as we completed the re-branding transition from Target to CVS across the country. The execution of transition went very smoothly and we have been very pleased with the level of collaboration between our teams and our partners at CVS. While it\u2019s not surprising that the re-branding activity has resulted in some near-term disruption, we are focused on restoring growth in this traffic-driving area in our stores. As a result, we are working closely with our partners at CVS as they launch media, marketing, and member engagement campaigns to increase awareness and utilization of CVS pharmacies in our stores.", "In addition, CVS is executing an in-store engagement campaign and plans to offer special flu shot incentives at the pharmacies in our stores. As we take steps to increase awareness of the CVS-Target partnership, both of them, our guests and members of the CVS PBM business, we expect to reaccelerate pharmacy traffic in our stores over time. Despite this quarter\u2019s challenges, we are pleased that the fundamental elements of our strategy are continuing to shape our results. Comparable sales in signature categories continue to lead the company, reflecting investments we have made in quality, presentation, and marketing.", "In the second quarter, comp sales growth in these categories outpaced the company by approximately 3 percentage points. Within signature, we saw particular strength in both kids and style. Results in kids reflected the launch of Cat & Jack, which is now positioned to become our biggest own brand. After the July rollout of this brand, we saw double-digit growth in Cat & Jack sales when measured against comparable sales of Circo and Cherokee last year.", "Within style, we continue to benefit from strength in women\u2019s apparel. We saw mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter. This performance was driven by double-digit growth in our Xhilaration brand, which is focused on a younger style savvy guest. In addition, we are really pleased with the performance of Who What Wear, which is one of the most productive brands on our women\u2019s floor pad. As a result, we are expanding the range of this assortment for the fall, inviting more of our guests to enjoy the items from this fashion forward collaboration.", "Digital sales grew more than 60% in the second quarter on top of 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in Target\u2019s digital assets to enhance the guest experience and drive sales in all channels, and our results demonstrate the impact of the investments we have made over time. For example, several years ago, we told you we had an opportunity to improve our digital conversion. Since then, we have invested to improve our conversion performance by streamlining online checkouts, making the site more appealing and easy to use, enhancing our personalization capabilities and improving search. As a result, for several years in a row, we have seen meaningful improvement in our digital conversion across all platforms, particularly in mobile. In the second quarter, we launched a brand new fully adapted site, which means we now provide a seamless experience across all platforms from desktop to tablets to smartphones. This is increasingly important because for many guests, a single purchase journey crosses over two or more of these digital devices.", "We are really pleased with the results in our new flexible format stores, which are designed for very dense driven and suburban neighborhoods. These stores allow us to operate in areas we have never been able to serve with our largest format stores, allowing us to extend our reach to consumers with high affinity for our brand. In July, we opened up new flex-format stores in Washington Square in Philadelphia, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Commonwealth in Boston, and Forest Hills in Queens. We are excited to be serving guests in these iconic neighborhoods and the guest response to these new locations has been fantastic.", "Financially, flexible formats are very successful. The sales productivity is much higher than our company average, and they have been meeting or exceeding our profit targets. In total this year, we are planning to open 14 flex-format stores, including a multilevel location in Tribeca this October.", "Based on our experience to-date and our investments and capability, we are increasingly confident in our ability to successfully open and operate stores in a variety of neighborhood settings across the country. As a result, we are accelerating our pipeline of locations we can open in future years and we expect flex-format stores to be a key driver of future growth. In our existing stores, we continue to invest in presentation and experience, particularly in signature categories.", "We completed the remodeling of our LA25 test stores in the second quarter and we are in the early stages of a robust learning plan to measure guest reaction to the changes we have made. Overall, we are encouraged by initial results in these stores and we are already rolling out some of the innovations from these stores more broadly. Namely, we are pleased with the presentation and innovation in home and apparel and results from our work to elevate the order pickup experience. So we are already extending these innovations beyond the LA market.", "In addition, the changes we have made to the food area in the LA25 test stores has really resonated with guests. Grocery sales in these stores are trending 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Relative performance in produce is even stronger, driving perishable comps that are more than 5 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Guests have told us the new food area now feels more intimate and separate from the rest of the store, providing a distinct grocery shopping experience they prefer. We are very encouraged with these initial observations and we will continue to leverage learning from these stores as we work to improve grocery performance across the chain.", "We were fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates a lot of cash even in challenging times. This cash allows us to make long-term investments in our business while returning cash to our shareholders at the same time. In June, we announced that our Board had approved a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend, supporting our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. In addition, our cash position allowed us to return well over $1 billion through share repurchase in the second quarter in support of our goal to return $3.5 billion or more this year.", "Looking ahead, we are very excited about the back-to-school and back-to-college season, which is second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. In back-to-school, we continue to work with kids and parents who inform our product design and development process. So it\u2019s only natural that this year, we engaged with kids to design and execute our back-to-school marketing campaign. Kids led all aspects of this campaign drafting storyboards, illustrating creative content, directing the spots and performing the music. To make shopping fast and convenient for busy families, this year we partnered with teacherslist.com to make nearly 1 million school supply lists available with our School List Assist tool on target.com. This tool allows parents to quickly and seamlessly purchase supplies of their kid\u2019s class list, arrange for store pickup or have the items delivered directly to their home.", "In back-to-college, our marketing campaign is designed around today\u2019s students, which are digital natives. In this campaign, we are partnering with three recent graduates to create inspiring, do-it-yourself videos to college students make their new dorm room or apartment feel like home. In addition, we have provided tools to make college shopping convenient and fun including college registry, order pickup, subscriptions and special offers on Cartwheel. As we have done for more than 15 years, we are hosting back-to-college after-hours shopping events, which will take place at 85 colleges and universities in the next couple of months. In these events, we provide free bus transportation from campus and provide students the opportunity to stock up and save on everything they will need for school.", "I want to pause here and mention how happy we are to have Mark Tritton on the Target team. Mark took on the role of Chief Merchandising Officer in the second quarter. And he spent the last couple of months getting to know his team and becoming immersed in our business. Mark is creative and passionate about retail. He has had an amazing career building iconic brands. And I am confident he will be able to grow with our own brands and our Target brand. Mark is planning to speak on this conference call next quarter when he will outline our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season.", "We continue to believe we are focused on the right strategic priorities and we are confident in our ability to grow profitably over time. We believe it\u2019s appropriate to update our sales and EPS outlook for the remainder of the year. Our decision is informed by the retail sales environment and the variability we continue to see in our weekly and regional results. While we are laser focused on accelerating traffic and sales, it\u2019s prudent to build near-term business and inventory plan that are consistent with recent trends. As always, we will be prepared to flex those plans upward if results begin to recover in the second half of the year.", "Before I turn the call over to John, I want to spend a second with a special thank you to our team and our stores. I visit our stores around the country nearly every week and I am so grateful to have a group of such smart and friendly team members serving our guests. John\u2019s team in headquarters is focused on ways to simplify our processes, modernize our supply chain and help to ensure our stores feature the right assortment of items that are in stock every day. When we backed up an outstanding team with the right business fundamentals, we offer an unparalleled experience in retail.", "With that, I will turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on his team\u2019s efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks Brian. Good morning everyone. As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It\u2019s long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. What I didn\u2019t fully appreciate until I came into my new role as COO was the workload that our supply chain processes have been driving into our stores. Historically, when we design processes to improve upstream efficiencies in our supply chain, we often achieve those benefits by moving work and complexity into our stores. One of the key priorities in my new team has been to look at the entire supply chain and find ways to optimize it end to end to deliver reliability for our guests while driving efficiency for the organization as a whole. A key measure of reliability is our ability to stay in stock and I am pleased that we continue to see improvement even as we begin to compare against improvements from a year ago.", "In stores, as we entered the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons, Target\u2019s overall out of stock position was better than we have ever measured historically. In addition, out of stocks on frequency and commodity items, the items which reliability is most important for our guests are in an even stronger position. And in the digital channel, while we have much work yet to do, we have already reduced out of stocks by more than 50% in the last six months. Our work to reduce variability in our distribution centers has been one of the drivers of these improvements. In the past, an unacceptable number of vendor shipments were received by our DCs either too early or too late. This variability drove a lot of extra workload in the DCs while reducing our reliability downstream. As a result this year, we have been collaborating with our vendors to increase the percent of shipments that arrive on the correct date and we have already seen meaningful progress. The percent of shipments that arrive on time has more than doubled and we expect to see additional improvement as we roll out new processes to additional vendors over time.", "As shipments arrive at our distribution centers, we have made changes to the prioritization of inbound processing, which have already cut the time to unload trailers by more than 50% and we believe we can cut that time even further. In addition, we have improved process flow between our import warehouses and our regional DCs, reducing the average time it takes for an item in an import warehouse to reach the store shelves by more than half. We are also focused on our outbound processing with the goal of enabling daily deliveries to every store throughout the week regardless of a store sales volume. When implemented, this change will drive additional improvements to store in-stocks while reducing backroom inventory and store workload. I want to thank the entire team from merchandise planning to our distribution centers, logistics teams and our stores for these improvements. Without the engagement of the entire end to end supply chain, we couldn\u2019t have made such amazing progress.", "Before I move on to our work in the stores, I want to comment briefly on our overall inventory position. As we have mentioned over the last several quarters, a portion of our year-over-year inventory growth reflects intentional investments we are making in non-seasonal commodity categories to support in-stock improvement on items most important our guests. In addition, our second quarter inventory reflected an investment to offer additional items in certain categories as we work with merchant teams to reliably offer appropriate assortment, both online and in our stores, to best serve our guests. Beyond our upstream supply chain work, our investment in self checkout lanes is also reducing store workload, freeing up time for our store teams to focus on guest service, while providing our guests with checkout option that many of them prefer. As of today, we have self checkout in just over 1,000 of our stores. We are planning to add it to another 200 stores by the end of the year and we will continue the rollout in 2017. In stores with self checkout, nearly a third of transactions go through these lanes, much higher than our initial projections. Our flexible fulfillment initiatives, including store pickup and ship-from-store are one way we are reinvesting store labor savings to serve guests in new ways. At the end of 2015, more than 460 stores were shipping items directly to guest homes and we are planning to double our capacity this year by expanding this capability to more than 500 additional stores. These additional locations will further improve our average ship time while providing deeper access to our store inventories increasing the likelihood that we can ship a guest\u2019s entire order from a single nearby store location. And importantly, because we are now pre-positioning high velocity web-only items in the backroom, a ship-from-store locations, we are able to reduce last mile and split shipment expenses dramatically.", "In-store pickup is an increasingly popular option for many of our guests. This year, we have seen 50% growth in pickup orders on top of 60% growth a year ago. Year-to-date more than 90% of our pickup orders have been ready in 1 hour and we have implemented process improvements to reduce wait times in stores. As a result, guest satisfaction with the pickup experience is up from a year ago and a higher percent of guests are repeatedly using this service.", "To prepare for this holiday season surge, we are investing to ensure our stores can continue to deliver a great pickup experience in the face of rapidly increasing demand. In 75 of our highest volume stores, we are increasing holding capacity to allow our team to retreat items more quickly even during peak times. We are also investing in additional digital devices to support peak demand and across all of our stores. We are rolling out new guidance on how our stores can optimize their storage space to enhance speed and efficiency. New this year, we have implemented systems and processes to allow stores to forecast and monitor pickup demand ensuring we maintain proper staffing levels. In addition, during the holiday season, about 300 stores will be testing separate branded shirts for the team members in the pickup area and distinctive bags for pickup orders to underscore our commitment to this experience.", "Finally, as Brian mentioned, back-to-school, back-to-college season is our second most important sales driver of the year. As a result, we are planning to carefully measure our pickup reliability and speed during promotional peaks this quarter, so we can apply those learnings in time for the holiday season when peak demand will be even higher. It was just a year ago that I began working with my new team. I am very proud of what we have accomplished since then. However, I am also energized by the opportunities still ahead of us to further increase the speed, flexibility and reliability of our supply chain, to drive unnecessary workload out of our stores and to enable operational excellence across the organization. As we work to accomplish these goals, I am fortunate to work with an experienced team, led by both internal talent and some amazing new hires and I am confident that with their leadership, we will continue to improve Target\u2019s operations on behalf of our guests.", "With that, I will turn it over to Cathy who will share her insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?", "Cathy Smith", "Thanks, John and hello everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.17 of debt retirement costs due to settlement timing on a subset of our first quarter debt tender offers.", "This quarter\u2019s profit performance was quite impressive in light of the challenging sales environment. Specifically, comparable sales declined 1.1% this quarter, in line with our guidance and well below our plan at the beginning of the year. As expected, the total sales in the second quarter were down more than 7% from last year driven by the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS. Digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, contributing 0.5 points of our comparable sales growth.", "Looking at the components of our comparable sales, comp transactions declined 2.2% partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket. While ticket growth was broadly consistent with the last couple of years, traffic performance showed a meaningful change from prior trend. I want to pause and make it clear that we are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance. And as Brian described earlier, we are taking steps to grow both our traffic and sales over time.", "REDcard penetration was 23.9% in the first quarter, up about 180 basis points from last year. However, given that last year\u2019s pharmacy sales had a much lower than average REDcard penetration, the removal of those sales from this year\u2019s results drove a portion of the penetration improvement. Excluding that benefit, REDcard penetration was up about 70 basis points from a year ago.", "Moving down the P&L, our second quarter EBITDA margin rate was 11.2%, up about 30 basis points from 10.9% a year ago. This improvement was entirely driven by a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A expense rate. Among the drivers of our gross margin rates, the pharmacy sales drove about 70 basis points of improvement from last year. This improvement was offset by pressure from shipping expense resulting from online growth, along with the impact of second quarter promotional and clearance markdowns partially offset by the benefits of our cost control efforts.", "On the SG&A line, we saw pressure from investments in our team and in marketing along with the de-leveraging impact of the decline in sales. These pressures were offset by the rate impact of the pharmacy sale combined with the benefit of our cost savings initiatives. Overall, we saw a year-over-year increase in our SG&A expense rate of about 20 basis points. Given the pressures we were facing, this is really impressive expense performance and I want to thank the team for their tireless efforts to control costs.", "Quarter end inventory was up a little more than 4% consistent with last quarter. Given the investments we have made in essential categories and assortment enhancements as well as the impact of the sales slowdown that occurred in the second quarter, our quarter end inventory position was relatively healthy. And of course, given our cost of sales outlook for the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor our receipts and inventory levels closely.", "Let\u2019s now turn to capital deployment. As we mentioned in our last conference call, this quarter we deployed about $1 billion to settle a portion of our first quarter debt tenders \u2013 tender offers and we funded a $750 million debt maturity in July. In addition, during the quarter, we returned another $1.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends of $330 million and share repurchase of more than $1.3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter conference call.", "One other note, through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased approximately $8.8 billion of shares under the company\u2019s current $10 billion repurchase authorization. As a result, we plan to request additional repurchase capacity from our board in the next several months. Given that our outlook anticipates continued cash available for share repurchase going forward.", "I want to reiterate that our priorities for capital deployment have not changed. First, we fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and intend to build on our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we return cash by repurchasing shares when we have the capacity within the limits of our A long-term credit rating. Looking ahead, we will continue to govern the pace and magnitude of share repurchase in support of our goal to maintaining those credit ratings.", "Despite the challenging environment, our business continues to generate very strong returns. For the 12-month period through second quarter, we reported an after-tax return on invested capital of 15.8%, up from 13.3% a year ago. I will quickly note, however, that this year\u2019s ROIC includes the one-time gain from the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS, which occurred last December. Without that one-time benefit, our second quarter after-tax ROIC was still a very healthy 13.7%, up about 40 basis points from last year.", "Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss the factors that are shaping our expectations going forward. Obviously, one consideration is the sales and traffic environment we have faced over the last several months, in which overall trends have been challenging and weekly and regional patterns have been more variable than normal. The second consideration pertains to the relative benefit of planning our business conservatively. If actual sales turn out to be stronger than our expectations, our teams are prepared to chase inventories and ramp up hours in our stores and distribution centers. In those situations, we generally generate healthy profit rates on incremental sales. However, those same profit dynamics typically work in reverse when we miss our sales outlook, given that it\u2019s more difficult to cancel orders and to pull back on labor hours. So despite the fact that we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and we are taking steps to address some of the company specific challenges Brian addressed earlier, we believe it\u2019s appropriate to temper our near-term sales and EPS expectations.", "So let\u2019s turn first to our outlook for the third quarter, beginning with sales. This quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales range of a minus 2% to flat, consistent with our second quarter guidance. If our comp sales are near the midpoint of that range, we expect to generate gross margin and SG&A expense rates similar to last year\u2019s level. This expectation reflects the continued benefit from the removal of the pharmacy sales from this year\u2019s results, offset by a continuation of the headwinds we faced in the second quarter.", "One note, the pharmacy sales is expected to cause a delta of a little more than 6 percentage points between comp sales and total sales this quarter, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we expect to de-leverage depreciation and amortization line in the third quarter as the depreciation and amortization dollars are expected to be essentially flat to last year, but spread over a smaller sales base.", "Altogether in the third quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.95. As we look beyond the third quarter, we are planning fourth quarter comp sales in the same range as third quarter. And given our third and fourth quarter profit outlook, combined with our year-to-date performance through the second quarter, we are planning to generate full year adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $5.20. We expect full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be about $0.44 lower than adjusted EPS as a result of the debt retirement and pharmacy transaction costs, which we recorded in the first half of the year. While this outlook for full year EPS is somewhat lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year, it reflects healthy profit performance in the face of challenging sales. And consistent with our performance through the first half of the year, it reflects the benefit of our cost savings initiatives and disciplined management by our team.", "Before I conclude my remarks, I want to thank the team for making cost control a long-term habit, not a short-term focus. Last year, we announced a plan to save $2 billion over 2 years and I am pleased to say that we are not only running ahead of that goal, but the team continues to find new opportunities to eliminate unnecessary costs and activities. These savings allow us to reinvest resources in our enterprise priorities while still generating solid financial performance even in challenging times.", "With that, we will conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Matt Fassler", "Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first and primary question relates to how much of impact do you think the CVS pharmacy transition had on traffic, did you see that dynamic deteriorate from the first quarter, and is there a way to qualify perhaps how much you feel like the spillover effect from that would have impacted the overall comp?", "Brian Cornell", "Matt, as I discussed in my prepared comments, our traffic was impacted by a number of factors, including CVS. So we certainly saw a slowdown in our pharmacy operations. We are working closely with CVS to launch some new marketing campaigns to win back our Target guests and certainly to begin to unlock the potential of their PBM network. So that\u2019s certainly played a role. But we also had other factors that we are focused on right now. We are not pleased with the performance we saw in food despite making some really good progress in presentation, improving our assortment, and certainly, the freshness to our products. So our number one focus as we sit here today is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating visits to our site. And addressing the pharmacy impact is just one of the variables we are focused on today.", "Matt Fassler", "Thank you for that. And by the way a quick follow-up, a different topic, you touched on Apple products down over 20%, we are obviously in the middle of a bit of pause between iPhone releases leading up to one most likely later this year, is the Apple softness, at this point, really an iPhone story or is it a broader issue across the product suite?", "Brian Cornell", "Matt for us, it\u2019s a broader story across the product suite. And one of the first things we have had Mark Tritton do was actually spend time with our Apple partners really making sure that we are putting the right plans together for the back half of the year, that we are ready to capitalize on their new innovation that they will be bringing to market. But again, as we think about factors that we have to address to improve our traffic and overall sales performance to the back half of the year, we have to improve electronic performance. It was a significant drag, 70 basis points on our overall comp declines in the quarter, and Apple played a significant role there. So we over indexed with Apple products. Our guests come to us looking for those products. They are looking for the newness and the innovation, and we are putting together plans with Apple and our merchandising teams to make sure we are ready to take advantage of that in the back half of the year.", "Matt Fassler", "Brian, thank you very much.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Schick", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning David.", "David Schick", "My question is on the competitive environment, you talked about all the different things you are working on with traffic, but is there anything out there that you are seeing \u2013 anything you could highlight sort of in the major categories that\u2019s going on in the marketplace that might be affecting your \u2013 either your traffic or your customers\u2019 attention and how you are thinking about addressing that in the back half?", "Brian Cornell", "Well Matt, I think we have seen this environment persist now for well over a year. It\u2019s a very cautious consumer. And if we look at the overall trends within retail, we have certainly seen on a rolling 12-month basis a slowdown in retail sales growth, but that\u2019s not an excuse for us. We are going to make sure we are leveraging our strategic levers. We continue to make sure we improve our in-store experience. As John talked about during the call, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we offer a sensational in-store pickup experience and also make sure that our site is easier to work with and allows us to ship directly to home. So we are going to make sure we are leveraging the key components of our strategy. I feel really good about the progress we have made in store in preparation for back-to-school and back-to-college. I have been out into a number of markets. I don\u2019t think our stores have ever looked better, so it\u2019s a competitive environment. It\u2019s going to continue to be a competitive environment, and we\u2019re got to make sure that we leverage our strategy, make sure that we are bringing the best of our signature categories and bringing the value the guest is looking for in core household essentials to win trips and win back trips in the second half of the year. So it\u2019s competitive, but it\u2019s always competitive, and we\u2019ve got make sure that we are leveraging our assets and our strategy to continue to drive performance in the back half of the year.", "David Schick", "I guess a follow-up to that would be, it\u2019s competitive as you say, it continues to be competitive, is there any change in the balance of whether its new products of merchandising or pathways brought to market or pricing, anything changing in the way of the competitive environment for you to make \u2026?", "Brian Cornell", "David, you have used an important term that I have been using internally and that is balance or rebalancing. And as I look at my experience now over the last couple of years at Target, we are best when we balance both ends of our brand positioning. We have got to deliver on the Expect More component. And I think we have done a sensational job there. Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that\u2019s the Pay Less side. And that\u2019s all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively in store, in our circular, on our end caps to our guests each and every week. So as we think about the back half of the year and the keys to driving our business going forward, we are going to have both of those levers in balance. We have got to continue to make sure our signature categories and particularly those in important style categories, continue to connect with our guests and we have got to deliver great value through household essentials, those everyday products that drive that Target run, so that balance or rebalance is critically important to the actions we are taking in the back half of the year.", "David Schick", "Thanks so much.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks David.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi. We had a question regarding the dynamics you are seeing between fill-in and stock-up trips. How are you feeling about that in your research? And also as we look towards the back half and model our views on comp store sales, what would you prioritize as the biggest drivers to improve traffic in terms of the different initiatives that you are pursuing in light of what you are seeing? And just another question we had is why do you think this happened in pharmacy in terms of what was the consumer experiencing in your store that made the transition a little more disruptive than you would have wanted? Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. Oliver, let me try to break apart those three questions and have Cathy and John jump in as appropriate. As we think about the rebalancing and the work that we are doing from a merchandising standpoint, an in-store presentation standpoint and also a weekly advertising standpoint, we recognized we have to continue to deliver the right presentation for that stockification and particularly in the back half of the month, have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right availability of the items our guest is looking for in that fill-in occasion. So, we are activating and ensuring we put those changes in place to find the balance as we speak today. So, we are certainly very focused and aware of the fact that we have to win on both fronts. We better have the right assortment for that stock-up occasion and we need to make sure we have the right pack price architecture to meet the needs of the guests during that fill-in occasion. So, we are very focused on that.", "From a CVS standpoint, I will let John jump in here. It\u2019s not a surprise to us that there has been some disruption. And I think for all of us on the call, we know what it\u2019s like when we change a pharmacy prescription and move from one provider to another. And while they are staying in our location, they have got to sign up for some new programs. They are entering a new environment. There is some time that, that\u2019s going to take, but we have been very pleased. John has been working with his CVS counterparts on the transition. We have had great collaboration, great partnership. We are starting to activate the marketing and the personalized messaging and we expect over time we will see that business accelerate and we expect pharmacy and the partnership to be a future driver of traffic and growth. But John, why don\u2019t you talk about some of the things we are doing at the store level with CVS?", "John Mulligan", "Yes, I think I would start by first echoing what Brian said. We talked going into the deal we had a great partner and it\u2019s certainly what we had observed through the transition here. It\u2019s been a great partner to work with. Our teams have worked together very well to transition. We have done the best job we can in transitioning guests, but as Brian said, change is change. And sometimes you just need to work through that. From a go-forward perspective, we are working with CVS certainly on some of their capabilities that they will bring to bear for Target. And as Brian said unlock their PBM network into our stores, but more importantly, day to day in the stores, we see great guest service \u2013 continue to see great guest service from our pharmacists. CVS would note that probably the best course they have ever seen in a transition like this and then starting to work with them to engage the pharmacy more back into the store through things like the opportunity here at back-to-school, back-to-college with flu shots and having the pharmacy play a more prominent role as we go forward. And so the teams continue to develop plans like that. They are very focused on it. We are focused on it. And we are very excited about the opportunity here as we continue to move forward.", "Cathy Smith", "Hey, Oliver, this is Cathy. I will add a little bit more too around priorities for driving traffic in the back half and we are really excited, because we go into this part of the year where we have a lot of events and that\u2019s where Target really have some great plans. We always have great plans, back-to-school, back-to-college. We are excited about, obviously, the launch of Cat & Jack has started out very successfully with a lot of learnings that we took away from Pillowfort, both online and in stores. And then, obviously, we go into our primetime. And so standing tall on the events that we typically have always done but we are really well positioned and then it\u2019s the things that Brian and John have already mentioned the rebalancing of our messaging. We are re-looking at all of our grocery efforts around presentation assortment and promotions of the electronics, the newness that Brian mentioned and then obviously the work that got John just said around CVS.", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. So, Oliver, as we think about the second half, we have got to continue to build on the things that are working today. Even in a challenging second quarter, we grew market share in the important apparel space. We saw very strong results in our home categories. We continue to be a destination for toys. So, we have had to build on the things that are working and ensure that we are also winning trips for those core household essentials. So, we will be focusing on rebalancing, on leveraging the improvements we have made, both in-store with our in-store pickup process and also online and we are not altering our strategic focus. It\u2019s making sure we get our strategies in balance and we deliver against both signature categories and those important household essentials that drive traffic to our stores and put cars in the parking lot.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you very much. Best regards.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Oliver.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kate McShane", "Hi, good morning.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning.", "Kate McShane", "I think when you gave guidance for Q2 originally it was because of some of the higher inventories that you flagged at other channels, especially with regards to apparel. So, I was just wondering how much you think you are benefiting from the weakness that we have seen at the brick-and-mortar department stores, especially when considering women\u2019s apparel comp was up mid single-digits during the quarter?", "Brian Cornell", "Well, we certainly think we are winning in the apparel space and I think a lot of that\u2019s really driven by the changes we have made, the improvement in our assortment, in quality and being more on trend with some of our fashion assortment. I talked about Xhilaration performing very well in the quarter. Who What Wear continues to be a real winner for us in connecting well with our guests. And we have also matched that up with an improved in-store experience. And we have been talking about mannequins for a while, but the role that our visual merchandisers are playing, the investment that John and I made last year to ensure we had not only mannequins and home vignettes, but the talent in our stores to maintain that experience 52 weeks a year is certainly connecting with the guests. So, we think we are benefiting by really executing against the strategy we have been talking about for several years making sure we have the right quality, innovation, presentation in our stores and we surround our guests with great service and that\u2019s paying off with market share gains in a challenging environment, where we continue to see improvement in our apparel and home assortments.", "Kate McShane", "Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning, Greg.", "Greg Melich", "Good morning. I want to follow-up a bit on traffic and then get into the guidance a bit. On traffic, I think about it a different way, I think about a year ago, traffic had recovered nicely to say up 1%. And overall, retail sales were growing roughly where they were if you just look at the government data and now the traffic is obviously down a couple of percent. Do you see any differences in terms of geographies or other things going on income demographics around your stores where that traffic trend is different, just looking at the last 12 months?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes, Greg, we certainly do. And Cathy and I talked about this at the end of the first quarter. We have seen quite a bit of variability on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis between different markets. We have seen particular strength in many of our West Coast markets, very strong performance in California, driven by great performance in LA and San Francisco, but other parts of the West Coast. We have seen pockets of softness on the East Coast. And we have really tried to make sure market by market, we are looking at those dynamics, looking at the competitive dynamics, understanding what we can leverage from the markets, where we are seeing increases like Los Angeles and bring that into challenged markets. But we have seen over the course of this year in 2016, much more variability than I have seen in many, many years. So, we are drilling down on that. And as we think about our plans for the second half of the year, we are building market-specific action plans to make sure we address the market-specific needs of our stores and our guests.", "Greg Melich", "That\u2019s helpful. And then Cathy, I think on the margins, just want to make sure I got the guidance right. If I take the midpoint, I get to the \u2013 you mentioned the third quarter flat EBIT margins although I imagine next to the CVS sale, they would be done like 30 bps in the fourth quarter. Is that right?", "Cathy Smith", "Yes. So, it\u2019s slightly down EBIT margin. We said gross margin SG&A about where they were last year.", "Greg Melich", "Got it. But for the fourth quarter, does the guidance imply that EBIT margins are going to be flat?", "Cathy Smith", "It is slightly up. So, yes, so slightly down Q3, slightly up in Q4.", "Greg Melich", "Okay. I just want to make sure I got that right. And then I guess last on that, just to make sure the inventory up 4%, you guys think, I mean are you comfortable with that number, not like part of the third quarter is working that inventory down?", "Brian Cornell", "Greg, we are very comfortable right now with our inventory position.", "Greg Melich", "Great. Thanks a lot, good luck.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Dan Binder", "Thanks. It\u2019s Dan Binder. I had a question on the consumer electronics category, you talked a lot about that today and I have noticed in your stores recently, you have had some reset activity, particularly in TV as you offer more 4K, I am curious as you work through these plans to improve that business, do think that can be a category that returns to positive comps by holiday given all the changes you are making?", "Brian Cornell", "Dan, I think it\u2019s going to be largely driven by the new innovation that we bring to the guest in the fourth quarter. So we have certainly seen pockets of strength, I mean there is certainly winners and losers within that space. We have seen continued performance with wearable technology, but it\u2019s not overcoming the softness we have seen in mobile, in tablets and in some of the core items. So I think the success of that category, as always is going to be driven by new news and news that connects with the guests and drives traffic into those categories. So again, it\u2019s why Mark and his team are very focused right now in working with our electronic vendors to make sure we have the right innovation, we are presenting it in a way that\u2019s impactful for the guests. And we have to see improvements in a category that\u2019s been a big drag on our comps over the last couple of quarters.", "Dan Binder", "And then I have a follow-up on the food category, you mentioned you are reevaluating promotion and I guess food and consumables, I am just curious it sounds like you will increase it, so I am just curious are you seeing others out there being more aggressive in the category, is that what you would attribute the softness to and if that is the case, which channels are you seeing at that?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. Dan, I think there has been a lot written recently about the competitive nature of the food channel. And for us on one hand, we feel \u2013 I feel really good about the progress we have made with assortment. If you walk our stores today versus even six months ago, aisle by aisle, you are seeing more organic, more natural, more gluten free, more local items that are on trend. The freshness and the work that John and his team have done from a supply chain standpoint is clearly connecting with the products we are delivering to the guests and we have seen an up-tick in categories like produce because we are delivering better product. But at the same time, market by market, this is a very competitive space. There is clearly food deflation right now that we are facing and it\u2019s a very competitive environment. And back to the earlier question about traffic and performance trends by market, we are looking very specifically at food by market across the country because we face a number of regional competitors and we have got to make sure our presentation, our promotion, our approach enables us to compete market by market.", "Dan Binder", "Congratulations on the LA25. It sounds like you are getting good results out of that, I was wondering if you could share with us the likelihood of being able to roll that out, is it a cost efficient format or are you primarily using it just for learnings?", "Brian Cornell", "Well Dan, we have certainly used it as a learning lab, but our intention is to lift the winners from LA25 and quickly bring them into other stores across the country. And while it\u2019s still is very early, we have effectively one quarter of learning under our belt. I am very pleased with some of the results we are seeing in apparel, in home and certainly in food where as I mentioned during my prepared comments, we are seeing performance in those 25 test stores that are clearly, clearly really encouraging from a food standpoint, particularly in the perishables space. So we will be looking to leverage that learning. That\u2019s part of our strategy that we have articulated for several quarters now that we want to use LA as a test market to lift and shift the winning concepts in more stores across the country. And we will continue to lift and leverage the learning from LA25 to improve the experience and the presentation of product throughout our Target stores.", "Dan Binder", "Thanks.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Scott Mushkin", "Yes. Hi, I wanted to continue on the path where Dan was going, but before you guys started, I had to say on our store visits, you can definitely see the improving execution, so kudos to John in getting that done. But getting back to the food discussion, our research has shown some pretty aggressive moves and I think Dan was getting at this, I mean are you guys going to match what\u2019s going on in the market and it looks like we are at the beginning end of the pretty aggressive price war, how do you see it, where do we \u2013 we are now seeing deflation reported by the government of 1.5%, 1.6% and our pricing service was even greater than that, so where do you see this going, what do you guys plan to do to combat it tactically in the short-term. And then I wanted to address the longer term food business after that?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. Well, Scott, I will start with we are playing to win and we have invested heavily in that very important category. We have had a long-term commitment to food. We think it\u2019s very important for our guests. And over the last couple of years, while we have done it in a very disciplined fashion, category by category and I appreciate hearing you say that you have seen an improvement in execution, hopefully in presentation. We have added thousands of new items. We have worked with our vendor partners to make sure we are bringing the right innovation, category by category. Our team is absolutely going literally item by item, commodity by commodity to look at how we source and how we flow product to improve freshness and the quality we present to our guests. So we are going to make sure we have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right quality. We have to have the right promotional strategy to compete, but we are playing to win both short-term and long-term. We think it\u2019s very important that we continue to make progress in this space. We are going to make sure we do it in a very focused manner. We really like what we are seeing in LA25. We are not going to roll it out to 1,800 stores tomorrow. We are making sure that we can validate what\u2019s working and how can we drive profitable sales in that space, but we are playing to win in food and we are going to continue to roll up our sleeves and make sure that we are into the details finding ways to unlock the growth potential in that critically important category.", "Scott Mushkin", "So Brian thanks for that answer. So to kind of dovetail more into a longer term, when you were at Safeway, you guys obviously did a lot of remodels that drove comp LA25, it sounds like traffic positive there, but in the article I think it was in the journal, they talked about the Board is very reluctant to put more capital behind the effort, talk us through this, I mean you got a traffic issue, consumables mean traffic, but if you want to invest, it\u2019s hard to get the traffic, so you are almost kind of caught in Catch-22 here and I just want to get your outlook or your thoughts on what I am saying given the longer term need for traffic and to drive traffic into the store to make earnings rise continuously as we look out into the out years?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. And Scott, in all due respect for the journal, let me speak on behalf of our leadership team and the Board. We have no hesitancy at all in investing capital in our business that drives growth and the right returns. And as Cathy has demonstrated throughout the last few calls, even in challenging times, we generate significant cash flows. And we want to make sure that the first thing we do with that cash is invest back in our business, so it\u2019s why we are spending time looking at LA25. It\u2019s why we have been testing a number of different features throughout our stores from apparel to home to food. It\u2019s why we are so excited about investing in flex-formats, where we see a very strong response from the guest. Those are delivering very strong returns, well ahead of our original plan. And food plays an important part in those smaller flex-formats. So despite what you may be hearing, we have absolutely complete support from the Board to make sure we are investing capital behind the initiatives that are going to drive future growth. So again, we are not playing for just the short-term. We are playing for the long-term. Those capital investments have to be done on behalf of the guests and our shareholders, but we are looking right now at a number of different opportunities to continue to invest to drive growth. So there is no hesitancy at all in making those investments. And as you just said, food and perishable and consumable categories will play a very important role in driving traffic to our stores. And in the future, we have got to continue to bundle that with the work John is doing to make sure and we are investing and improving our in-store pickup processes and experience. That\u2019s an investment we are making, an investment we are making for the holiday season. We are continuing to invest in our digital assets. So there is no hesitancy at all from this management team nor the Board in making the right investments in our long-term success.", "Scott Mushkin", "Alright. Thanks guys and thanks for the answers. I appreciate it.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Scott. Operator, we have got time for one last call.", "Operator", "Okay. Your last question comes from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead with your question.", "Joe Feldman", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, one of the questions I had was you guys have made a lot of changes in the stores and we clearly see them and obviously we talked for the past hour about a lot of them. I am curious about the marketing or communication of that though to just the consumer. I mean, we see it because we are all following the company pretty aggressively and in the stores, but I wonder if there is more could be done on the advertising side to tell people that you have made so many changes in grocery or that the home department looks better in a lot of stores or can you talk a little bit about that and where we are at in terms of when we will see something like that communication wise?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. Joe, it\u2019s a great question for us to end on and I will take personal responsibility for this. I talked earlier about the fact that we have got to be rebalancing our messaging. And we have done a really terrific job of elevating our messaging and communication around our signature and particularly our style categories. As we go forward, I have used this term before, we have got to make sure we are rebalancing and we have got to make sure we continue to elevate our messaging, our communication around style and those core household essential categories, which include food that drive traffic to our store and important to our guests. So, making sure we go back to the brand promise. We have got to make sure that Expect More categories like style we continue to elevate and we have got to make sure we deliver the Pay Less component and ensure that we balance the work that we are doing from a style standpoint with the progress we are making on those core household essentials, which include food in that offering. So, it\u2019s a really important question. It\u2019s certainly a big area of focus for us in the balance of the year and into 2017. And I think it\u2019s going to be part of the formula that drives traffic back to our stores and improves comp store growth over the balance of the year and into 2017.", "Brian Cornell", "So operator, with that, we are going to conclude our call and I thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call today.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 16, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer, John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, Brian will recap our third quarter performance and progress in pursuit of our strategic objectives. Mark will provide detail on recent category performance along with our fourth quarter merchandising and marketing plan, John will provide an update on our efforts to improve operations and modernize our supply chain and finally Cathy will offer more detail on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.", "Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.", "As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his comments on the third quarter and our expectations going forward. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the financial results we announced earlier this morning. While we have much more work to do. This quarter we saw a meaningful progress in our efforts to improve our traffic in sales as both metrics improved by about a percentage point compared with the second quarter.", "In addition, we generated much stronger than expected EPS performance, driven by strong signature category growth, favourable results and back-to-school and back-to-college season and the continued benefit of our cost savings efforts.", "Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.04 was 22.1% higher than last year and well beyond the high end of the guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. With this outstanding third quarter performance, Targets adjusted EPS has grown more than 10% through the first three quarters of the year. This is particularly strong performance given that we\u2019ve experienced flat, comparable sales growth during this period.", "In addition, our business continues to generate very strong after tax returns on invested capital. For the 12-months through the end of the third quarter, we reported a very healthy after tax ROIC of 14.3% excluding the onetime benefit of the gain on the sale of our pharmacy business. This performance represents an increase of approximately 130 basis points from a year ago.", "Of course, strong cash generation by our business allows us to continue to fund a healthy level of investments in our stores, supply chain and technology, while funding robust cash returns to our investors.", "In the third quarter, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date we\u2019ve already returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. I\u2019d like to pause and thank our team for their boundless energy and passion to serve our guests by offering them unique merchandise, outstanding service and a best-in-class experience. They deserve all the credit for our outstanding financial results this quarter.", "As I look ahead, I am really excited about our holiday merchandising and marketing plans, and I\u2019m confident that our outstanding team will bring those plans to life for our guests in our stores and digital channels throughout the holiday season.", "Our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress on many of our strategic priorities, reflecting our work on category rolls. Sales and signature categories accelerated in the third quarter, out comping the company average by more than three percentage points.", "Signature growth with the key driver behind healthy comp increases in both home and apparel, and we continue to see market share gains in these important categories. Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third-quarter sales in the back-to-school, back-to-college season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales.", "In addition, our gross margin rate continues to reflect the cost of goods benefits of our ongoing cost control initiatives. Within our signature category results, we're seeing exceptional growth in our two new brands we launched earlier this year, Pillowfort and kids' home and Cat & Jack and kids apparel.", "We developed these new brands in collaboration, with both kids and their parents and our guests continue to respond to the unique combination of style, quality and value these new brands deliver. We also continue to see robust growth in our digital sales. Digital sales grew more than 26% in the third quarter and they have grown more than 20% year-to-date.", "This year, we have devoted both capital and expense to improve the digital experience, increase reliability and create additional capacity, and we're seeing really encouraging results. This quarter we ran a promotion in that among other things, the lattices [ph] stress test or systems in advance of the fourth quarter.", "This promotion was an unprecedented and compelling offer for our guests, 10% off on our entire assortment in both stores and digital channels. As you'd expect the offer drove strong traffic and sales in all channels, but our digital comp and the day was particularly high.", "In the face of very strong surge in traffic, I'm happy to report that our system performed very well providing us valuable insight as we prepare for even bigger days this holiday season. Last year to support our strategic investments and Targets digital capabilities, supply chain and store experience, we launched a comprehensive cost-savings efforts to free up resources and create capacity, and our team has really delivered.", "We had an ambitious goal to take a total of two billion out of Targets expenses and costs of goods over two-year period, yet as we approach the end of that two-year period, I am pleased that our team has actually exceeded our $2 billion goal and importantly, the team has identified additional opportunities will pursue in future years. The ability to create additional capacity is critical, given the sizable investment we continue to make as we position our business for long term growth.", "Finally, we are really excited about the continued and strong performance of our new flexible format stores. These new locations allows to reach new neighborhoods in dense urban and suburban markets. We opened another five of these stores across the country in the third quarter, including our fantastic new store in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City.", "When we opened an operating stores, we go beyond legacy systems and processes, customizing the assortment and operations such as the characteristics of the individual neighborhoods in which we operate and we continue to see phenomenal response from our guests, including this quarters openings. We are now operating nearly 30 of these new format stores.", "Based on their performance, we are increasingly confident and the opportunity for Target to profitably operate hundreds of urban and flex format stores over time, reaching new neighborhoods where consumers have a strong affinity for our brand.", "As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are continuing to address the challenges I described on our last conference call, first and foremost is traffic. And while we saw a considerable improvement this quarter, we are committed to growing our comp [ph] traffic and sales overtime.", "A key factor is our ability to deliver on both sides of our expect more, pay less brand promise, and our signature category performance demonstrates that we continue to deliver on the expect more size. However, earlier this year we began to fall short in communicating value to support the payless side, both in our stores and in our marketing.", "In the third quarter, we began to address that imbalance by communicating our commitment to value more clearly. We believe those changes were instrumental in driving improve traffic and comp sales in the third quarter.", "Going forward, we are committed to striking the appropriate balance in all of our marketing communications. We also continued our work to improve the performance of our assortment of convenient, self-service food in our stores. We saw another small decline in food comp sales in the third quarter, reflecting near term challenges presented by deflation, and an intensely competitive environment.", "Despite these near-term challenges, we are focused on delivering stronger growth overtime, and Mark will outline his team\u2019s plans in a few minutes. In addition, comp sales in our electronics and entertainment categories continue to underperform the company average, however, in the third quarter, we were encouraged to see a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products driven by their introduction of several new product innovations.", "As you know electronics, entertainment, and toys are key gifting categories in the fourth quarter, and the team is excited about their plans to compete and win at this critical time. Finally, we continue to work with CVS to drive script count growth into pharmacies in our stores.", "As a result of our coordinated marketing efforts, which include our stores, our weekly ads, and CVS direct communication to their PBM members. We measured an increase in consumer awareness of the transition of our stores, pharmacies, the CVS and we've seen a corresponding improvement in the script trends in these pharmacies. We continue to believe our CVS partnership will be important traffic driver overtime, and we expect to see significant improvement in 2017.", "Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and reflect on the progress and the business results for the first three quarters of the year. When you focus on the top line, you'll see that we've generated essentially flat comps through the first nine months of the year, this is well below the expectation we had at the beginning of the year and our first and highest priority is restore growth of the traffic and sales trends. However, when you move to the bottom line, you'll see that we've grown adjusted earnings per share more than 10% in the first nine months of the year. This is outstanding performance, but it's particularly noteworthy in light of the sales challenges we've been facing, the performance is a testament to the resilience of our underlying business, our strategy and of course our team, the best team in retail.", "Now I'd like to welcome Mark Tritton onto the call. Mark comes to us with an impressive history and retail merchandising with experience at Nike, Timberland and most recently Nordstrom. Mark is our merchants merchant and a strong leader.", "Since he arrived at Target, I've been impressed with how quickly he has become immersed in our business, and integrated into our team. We're excited at Mark leading merchandising and I know he's excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more details on the category performance in the third quarter and our plans to win during the holiday season and beyond. Mark?", "Mark Tritton", "Thanks Brian, and hello everyone. I'm so happy to be joining all of you on the call today and look forward to meeting with you in New York this spring. As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business understanding Target strength and exploring what we have the biggest opportunities to grow. And what I found is, it\u2019s a strong business as it stand today a powerful Target brand, an impressive home brand portfolio, great looking stores, a friendly and engaged team, and a huge base of passionate guests.", "With these strengths, we also have an amazing opportunity in front of us. It has been energizing to dig in with the team to develop merchandising\u2019s plan to drive Targets future growth. I look forward to sharing our vision in detail -- with their financial community meetings.", "For today, I'm going to focus on our recent performance and our plans for this quarter and the holiday seasons. In the third quarter, sales performance improved across nearly every part of our business, comp sales and apparel and home have accelerated the most, providing a positive mix benefit on the gross margin lines. Strong execution and mark down management compounded that benefit leading to much stronger than expected gross margin in the quarter.", "As Brian mentioned, we saw very strong trends in back-to-school and back-to-college reflecting our focus on key growth categories and the benefit improvements we made to our promotional cadence, digital growth played a big role in the season, particularly in home which is already one of our biggest and most profitable categories online.", "We\u2019ve continued to see the fastest growth in signature category sales. A few of the highlights from the third quarter include kids, we've seen outstanding performance in Cat & Jack and Pillowfort, but also continue to generate strong comp in women's ready-to-wear on top of outstanding growth in 2015. And within home, our results were strongest in the day core and seasonal category.", "Given this strong growth in Signature, both home and apparels saw low single-digit growth in comp sales this quarter extending our record of market share gains in these strategically important categories.", "As Brian mentioned, the electronics recent product launches helped improve trends in Apple this quarter, however, we continue to see soft trends in mobile phones overall, which is what we've seen in the industry as upgrade cycles are lengthening.", "In food and beverage, we saw another small comp sales decline this quarter. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we have an opportunity to more clearly convey and resonate value for our guests in this important category. This is being done through our end cap presentations, enhancing our use of local pricing and making changes to our promotional cadence. And we expect to see the full benefit from these changes in the fourth quarter.", "In Essentials, where we identified a few more opportunities, we have seen faster progress as a result come cells grew essentials in the third quarter and we expect to see continued progress this quarter. Also as Brian mentioned before, we've seen a meaningful improvement in script counts in the CVS pharmacies in our stores. We're also seeing higher gift services scores compared with the period prior to and particularly during the conversion of our policy. These improvements show that our guests are moving beyond the temporary disruption caused by those conversions.", "And with the disruption behind them, they are responding to the services and capabilities that CVS can provide. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to build on our momentum from the third quarter. Target is a destination for seasons and no season is more important than the holiday.", "In home, we're looking to build on last year's success when we saw the biggest comp growth in more than a decade. A holiday Decor assortment will feature products based on three key seasonal trends; Traditional, Nordic and Modern and this year we've created one to shop, a destination in our stores and on target.com that will grab guest attention and put them in the mood to shop for the season.", "Wondershop features thousands of new holiday trim items, in fact about 70% of the assortment is new this year, we're also bringing back to the holidays our collaboration with stationary designer sugar paper, which was a big hit last year. This features a limited-edition collection ranging from $1.50 upto $15.", "Holiday is an important apparel season for families, and we're well positioned to live it for our guests with a new Cat & Jack collection. This new brand has hit a sweet spot with millennial parents in particular, and we have high expectations for what it can deliver during the holiday season.", "Between October and December, we are introducing more than 1,000 new pieces to our Cat & Jack assortment, each piece is under $30 which is unbeatable value when you consider the design and quality. As Brian also shared, toys play a key role in the fourth quarter. In fact, we do about 50% of our annual toy sales during this timeframe and this year we're building on 10 consecutive quarters of growth in toys reflecting our investment in newness, differentiation and collectability.", "This holiday season we\u2019ve added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys, up more than 15% from last year. As you recall, Target have a number one market in Star Wars last year. This fall, we have once again led the market with launch of our Rogue One assortment and for holiday we are featuring more than 100 new products. Be on Star Wars, Disney Princesses continue to do very well.", "Elsa from Frozen remains our top seller, selling more than the other 11 princesses combined and emerging trading board games has been a bright spot for us this year, as families are looking for activities that bring them together. We\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in board games so far this year and we\u2019ve got 50 Target exclusive games this season for you.", "In electronics this quarter, we're planning for strong demand for Apple new products, given that pre-order volume was three times higher than last year. We're also expecting a lot of guest\u2019s interest in Virtual Reality along with connected home devices like Google home.", "Elevated service in our electronics department is also important to help make shopping in this area a more enjoyable experience for our guests, and drive incremental sales in our stores, so more than 1,500 stores were transitioning from Target mobile reps who are focused only on mobile to Target tip [ph] the scope will include all of electronics. Last year exclusive CD from Adele was a massive hit through the holiday season.", "This year, we've got a collaboration with Garth Brooks and we expect it to be huge. Targets 10-disc box set includes Garth\u2019s new album with two exclusive tracks including the much-hyped 25th anniversary edition of \"Friends in Low Places\". By the way Target is the only place you'll ever be able to find that track, the set went on sale for 2999 [ph] on November 11 two weeks before Garth's new album will be available at other retailers.", "This year in food and beverage, about 20% of our national brand holiday assortment is exclusive to Target and we\u2019ve more than doubled their assortment of craft beers from last year, going for about 700 to nearly 1,500 options across the country. In our marketing and promotion, we are coordinating everything for our guests, inspiring them with providing ease and convenience during the stressful time of year.", "From the one-to-shop to the Wonderlist Gift Guide and the kids wish list app, we're making it easy and fun for guests to find the right gift for everyone on their list. Guests love our 10 days of deals last year, so we're bringing back these popular promotions on the days leading up to and following Black Friday. Based on guest\u2019s insights, we\u2019ve optimized these cadence of deals and simplified office to make them easy to understand.", "In addition, we've worked with our stores to streamline guest communication, bring up store teams to serve our guests during the busiest time of the year. And finally, throughout the season our broadcast ads will build excitement for the race of the toy cracker, I'll take on the classic story of The Nutcracker. We will release this new holiday story in two, four minute segment during the world broadcast premiere of Frozen on December 11. Kids of all ages will not want to miss it.", "With all this amazing content, I hope you can see where we are so excited about our merchandised promotion and marketing plans for the holiday seasons, however as we all know these plans will only come to life through the work of our operations teams. So now I'm going to turn the call over to John who will outline how his team is prepared to deliver on those plans and provide outstanding service to our guests throughout the holiday seasons, John.", "John Mulligan", "Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season, and as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we are well positioned to deliver great guest service, and a better experience in every channel.", "In our stores, we've hired and trained tens of thousands of seasonal team members, who are already serving our guests. Notably, despite the tightest labor market conditions, we've seen in sometime, our hiring and training process went smoothly. In fact, we met our key hiring and training milestones earlier than a year ago.", "When guests shop at our stores this holiday season, in addition to great products displays and services, you'll find our in stock position is better than we've ever measured, reflecting improvement across every category we sell, and importantly, we are attaining those in stock levels with lower inventory than a year ago.", "Over the last 18 months, we've deliberately invested in our inventory position and key commodity categories. To ensure we remain in stock, and categories where reliability is most important to our guests. However, now that we've annualized these investments, and we're beginning to see the benefit of our work to make our supply chain faster, and more reliable, we\u2019ll be able to deliver outstanding in stocks on a smaller base of inventory over time.", "The accuracy of our inventory data is key to our speed and reliability, and we've been investing in our systems and processes to achieve greater accuracy. One example is our implementation of our RFID Technology and a portion of our apparel assortment, which is currently in more than 1,600 of our stores.", "In affected categories, overall inventory accuracy has increased dramatically, meaningfully reducing the number of occasions in which we can't physically locate an item. In addition, we've made system changes to optimize replenishment of products that our guests purchase in multiples and made changes to minimum on hand standards and higher volume locations, both of which have dramatically reduced our stocks on effective items. We will continue to test and roll out these enhancements throughout next year", "Because of our efforts to eliminate non-guests facing work in our stores, the team is delivering outstanding service to our guests, while delivering efficiency and support of our cost control efforts.", "Through the redesign of our in-store replenishment processes and algorithms, we've reduced stores background trips dramatically this year, delivering tens of millions of dollars of payroll savings that we have reinvested in service. Two areas in which we've invested store labor for the store pickup process and our ship from storage capability. Guests love the flexibility of these capabilities all year especially, but especially during the holiday season. Infact, during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, we expect our stores to fulfil more than half of our digital demand.", "While this is the third holiday season in which we've offered order pick up in all of our stores, we're planning for volume to grow another 50% from a year ago. Since last year, we've added additional holding capacity to more than 80 of our highest volume pickup locations and we've invested in scheduling tools and additional digital devices to enable high volume locations to deliver fast service, even in peak times, and this year in more than 300 of our highest volume pickup locations, our store team will wear unique shirts and deliver separately branded reusable bags to underscore our commitment to the pickup experience.", "Our last year's holiday season, about 460 of our stores were shipping directly to our guests, not more than threefold from about 140 stores in 2014. This year we've extended this capability to another 600 stores, meaning that well over a thousand of our stores are shipping directly to our guest this season.", "In total, these stores are expected to ship more than three times as many units as last year accounting for about a third of our digital volume during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. Shipping for stores delivers a number of benefits to our guests, and to our business. Most importantly, this capability reduces shipping times given the proximity of these stores to the vast majority of the U.S. population.", "With that proximity of guests, we also save on shipping, helping to relieve the pressure from shipping growth in our P&L. It also allows us to balance our inventory across our store and network, maintaining in stocks while reducing markdowns in store locations with heavy inventory.", "And finally, store shipping released pressure on our fulfilment centers, especially during peak season, allowing the entire network to function more effectively. Our three delayed allocation centers, which have all come online this year, or another way we have created capacity. These facilities allow us to aggregate inventory and slower moving, but harder to forecast categories, allowing us to improve our store allocation without hurting lead times.", "During peak season, we\u2019ll be fully utilizing these facilities to free up space in our regional DC's, to enhance the overall speed and reliability across our distribution network. Finally, as a result of our efforts to optimize inbound processes, we expect to double the percentage of our holiday receipts that are processed within 24 hours of arrival. This will enhance our store in stocks or freeing up meaningful space in our regional DC's, further enhancing speed and efficiency.", "While we're just getting started, our team is really excited about our progress in modernizing Targets operations, and we're pleased to hear from many of you that you're beginning to notice the difference when you shop with us, while that's great to hear, I want to emphasize that we are not slowing down. Our team is energized and focused on our plans for the next year and beyond, and I look forward to sharing those plans with you in February.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy who will share her perspective on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?", "Cathy Smith", "Thanks John and hello everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year, and well above the top end of our guidance range.", "This performance would be noteworthy in any environment, but it is especially impressive given our challenging sales trends. Comparable sales declined 0.2% in the third quarter, this is a full percentage point better than our second quarter performance and near the high end of our guidance range, however it's well below the growth we expect to generate over time.", "With removal or pharmacy in clinic sales from this year's results, total sales were down nearly 7% in the quarter. Digital sales increased more than 26% contributing about 70 basis points through our comparable sales. Digital growth was fastest in our Signature categories and was particularly strong in kids, driven by the strength of our back-to-school offering and the launch of Cat & Jack. This is particularly exciting because signature categories are items and brands uniquely Target.", "Among the components of our comp sales, transactions were down 1.2% in the third quarter and one percentage point improvement from the second quarter. Average ticket increased 1% in line with our performance so far this year. I want to pause here and make it clear that while we have made significant progress we are not satisfied with a third quarter traffic and sales performance. First and foremost, we are focused on restoring growth to both of these metrics over time. Our REDcard program is our most powerful loyalty vehicle and it\u2019s continuing to grow.", "Sales penetration on our REDcards was 24.3% in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, and two percentage points ahead of last year. Excluding the benefit from the pharmacy transaction, penetration was up about 80 basis points in the quarter, which is consistent with our year to-day performance.", "Moving down the P&L, our third quarter segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.9% up from 8.6% last year, about two-thirds of this improvement was driven by an increase in our gross margin rate combined with the benefit of a lower SG&A expense rate. Specifically our gross margin rate improved about 80 basis points compared to last year, which was much stronger than expected. This improvement was entirely driven by merchandize mix resulting from both the pharmacy transaction and strong performance in our signature categories.", "On the SG&A line, we saw about 40 basis points of improvement from a year ago, which reflects the benefit of our ongoing cost control efforts. As John mentioned, we continue to find ways to eliminate non guest facing labor in our stores. This creates capacity that allow their team to focus on guest service while maintaining outstanding efficiency to support our financial performance.", "For the first time this year, our quarter end inventory was lower than a year ago, the team has done a fantastic job responding to the recent slowdown in our sales by effectively managing inventory and receipt. With this strong execution, we've seen outstanding gross margin performance so far this year, and as we enter the peak of the holiday season, we feel very good about the level and the composition of our inventory.", "Let\u2019s turn now to capital deployment. We paid $345 million in dividends during the third quarter, and returned another $878 million through share repurchase. A portion of our third quarter repurchase activity was accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion of this ASR was settled after the end of the quarter.", "Through the first three quarters of 2016 we have repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares which keeps us on track to invest $3.5 billion or more in share repurchase this year. One thing to note is that during the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchases authorization. We\u2019ll begin repurchasing shares under this new program when we complete the current $10 billion program.", "As of the end of the third quarter we had approximately $300 million of remaining capacity on the current $10 billion program. And one other item to note, during the third quarter we obtained a new $2.5 billion credit facility that expires in October of 2021. This new facility replaces a two and a quarter billion dollar facility that was scheduled to expire in 2018.", "We have never borrowed under any of our prior credit facilities, and we would not expect to borrow under the new one either, however, it provides an important source of backup liquidity, and it serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program, which we use to fund our seasonal borrowing needs.", "Reflecting our focus on disciplined capital deployment, one of our goals is to grow our after tax return on invested capital into the mid-teens overtime. I am pleased to share that we are making significant progress toward this goal. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, our business generated and after tax ROIC of 16.3%, however that calculation includes the one time game from the pharmacy sales which we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year, excluding that gain, our third quarter after tax ROIC was 14.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago.", "Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Consistent with last quarter, we are maintaining a cautious outlook. Given the current environment and the prospect of a very competitive holiday season, with that in mind, we are planning our fourth quarter comparable sales to be roughly consistent with our third quarter performance in a range around flat plus or minus 1%.", "Total sales are expected to decline about 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. This will be the last quarter in which we will be copying [ph] over pharmacy and clinic sales from the prior year. In terms of operating margin, we're expecting our fourth quarter segment EBIT margin rate will be up slightly, about 10 basis points higher than last year.", "This outlook is based on an expected 40 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin rate, driven entirely by a lower SG&A expense rate. Offsetting this improvement, we expect to see an increase of about 30 basis points in our depreciation and amortization expense rate, this will be driven by approximately $50 million of accelerated depreciation related to our 2017 story model program, along with the de-leveraging effect of the total sales decline resulting from the pharmacy transaction.", "Altogether, in the fourth quarter we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of a $1.55 to $1.75. When we combine the fourth quarter expectations with our year-to-date performance we're expecting to generate approximately flat comfortable sales for the full year, and full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.30.", "Notably, the top half of this updated EPS range is within the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. This demonstrates how effectively our team has performed in the face of unexpected sales challenges.", "Looking in the next year our first focus is to restore growth in our traffic and comparable sales, with sales growth, a strong gross margin mix and continued cost discipline, we believe we can sustainably grow both the top line and the bottom line over time. I look forward to discussing our longer-term aspirations and our outlook for 2017 performance at our meeting with you in February.", "Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian who has a few closing remarks. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Cathy. Before we open up for questions, I want to pause and recap our position as we enter the final quarter of the year. Yea-to-date, comp sales have been about flat, and we believe it's prudent to plan for a similar trend in the fourth quarter. That said, we're very excited about our plans for the holiday season, and our team is focused on outperforming our plan, gaining market share and delivering positive comp sales across our business, not just in signature categories.", "On the adjusted EPS line, we have grown more than 10% so far this year and based on our fourth quarter expectations, our updated range for full-year adjusted EPS overlaps with the original guidance range we provided last March, reflecting the team\u2019s strong execution in the face of challenging sales trends.", "Signature category sales continue to far outpace the company average, and we continue to gain market share in these categories. And because our digital growth continues to outpace the industry average, we continue to gain share in the digital channel as well. So while we continue to adjust our near-term tactics to better maintain the balance on both sides or expect more, pay less brand promise, we believe we have the right long term strategic plans to sustain Targets performance over time. I look forward to covering both our fourth quarter results and our longer term strategic and financial plans at our financial community meeting which we\u2019ll be hosting in New York on February 28.", "We will be providing more details on timing and location soon, but in the meantime, please mark your calendars for that date. With that, we\u2019ll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Cathy, Mark, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.", "Bob Drbul", "Good morning. I just had a couple of questions for you. On pricing throughout the quarter and I guess into the holiday season, what are you seeing and what are you expecting in competition, and talk a little bit about your ongoing strength in toys, could you just talk about the drivers to the toys in the fourth quarter, and how you expect that to perform as a category?", "Brian Cornell", "Bob, good morning. As we think about the holiday season, we expect it to be a very competitive, promotional environment like we've seen over the last couple of years. So, we think we've got great plans in place and we're very excited about the merchandising, the marketing and promotional plans, and we think we're going to be very competitive throughout the season.", "As it pertains to the toys, again, we've had a multi-year positive run in that category and one of the things that's really been important for us is working with key partners, like Disney Mattel, Hasbro to make sure we bring you exclusive items to our assortment. As we go into the holiday season, we're excited to have 1800 exclusive items in that category, and we think that it is going to be very important to our guests throughout the holiday season.", "Bob Drbul", "Great, Brian. Can I just ask one more follow-up, so when you look at the business over a longer period of time, this has historically been a relatively steady business, I was just wondering when you look at the volatility between what you saw last quarter and your results and sort of your forecast for that -- the fourth quarter and within three months and it's a dramatic change in the outlook, can you just talk a little bit about exactly what is factored, what factors are driving this?", "Brian Cornell", "You know Bob as we think about our strategy and our approach, while we're certainly very pleased with the progress we saw in the third quarter, it's a result of being very focused on the strategy with that in place for almost two-and-a-half years now. In our results and the improvement we saw in the third quarter is really driven by one, our focus on those signature categories, our commitment to apparel and home, baby and kids, where we continue to see very strong growth and market share improvement.", "We've been very committed to improving our digital engagement, and year-to-date we\u2019re up over 20%. We saw a 26% growth in the third quarter, and the investments we've been making to improve functionality and ease online is certainly connecting with our guests. We've been very focused as we've talked about in expanding our format in the new urban neighborhoods, and every time we open up a new store whether it's in New York Tribeca or Philadelphia, we're seeing a great response from our guests.", "And we've been on a journey over the last couple of years to drive greater efficiency throughout our organization. And with John's leadership, we continue to see very strong improvement and operational efficiencies and cost that were returning to the bottom line.", "So our focus over the third quarter is very similar to the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. And we just intensified our focus on executing against our key strategic plans.", "Bob Drbul", "Thanks very much. Good luck.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian Cornell", "Morning, Scott.", "Scott Mushkin", "Good morning, good performance and in controlling the controllable. So just kind of want to step back in and you know we got traffic that\u2019s negative, and trying to understand as we get out to like next year and the year beyond, where you know obviously you guys are doing a great job controlling SG&A costs, but it was very hard for retailer like Target to run this balance with traffic down and sales kind of flat especially with wage costs rising as rapidly, so, Brian if you could take it out and kind of talk about the strategy to drive traffic, get the sales up, I think you are through the number out there 3% comp growth, 2017 and beyond, just how do we get there?", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, as we think about the next several years, we are going to continue to see as make significant investments in our assets improving in-store experience. We're already seeing the benefits of the investments we've made in apparel and home. We're very pleased with some of the learning from LA 25 that we\u2019ll be transitioning into our new remodels as we go forward.", "So we think the importance of the in-store experience, great customer service continuing to bring newness to our assortment, elevating and developing our own brands. I think one of the big highlights for Target in 2016 is the way our guest has reacted to two great new brands, both Pillowfort and Cat & Jack have been incredibly well received.", "The style, the quality, the value we are delivering is connecting with our guests. So the combination of gradients or experience, making sure, we surround our guests with great customer service, whether they're shopping in our store or they've ordered online and they're coming in to pick up that order, and then delivering great Target brands, at a value.", "So we think that combination is the strategy that drives traffic into our stores, cars into our parking lot and even more engagement online.", "Scott Mushkin", "Right, perfect. And just as a follow-up to kind of thinking about the 2017 and beyond, I know CVS was out [ph] since last week, you know they're losing a lot of scripts, because of the dynamics that are going on there and now clearly you don't script don't matter anymore to you guys, but how about the traffic impact on Target as we get it 2017 and beyond, have you guys thought about that, and what that can be?", "Brian Cornell", "Scott, I will start with scripts matter a lot to us. And key to the partnership with CVS is making sure we're working together to drive scripts because back to the importance of traffic scripts will be an important part of driving traffic to our stores. And we were very pleased in the third quarter with the progress we're seeing. We're seeing much greater awareness now that we've completed the new branding, the combination of our in-store marketing and CVS marketing is their PBM is driving increased traffic to the pharmacies.", "So that is a very important lever going forward. And we're very confident in our partnership. John Mulligan works very closely with the CVS team. We've got great plans in place for the fourth quarter, and even stronger plans as we go into 2017. So that is a very very important part of the traffic equation. And we think over time, that's going to be a key driver of traffic into our stores.", "Scott Mushkin", "All right, perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI", "Greg Melich", "Hi, thanks. I really want to follow up on grocery & food and the strategy there, and how we're going to use that to drive traffic, and also on traffic, an update on your digital initiatives. I know you were doing some tasks of combining Cartwheel with REDcard, just love to hear how those are going, and how you think those could help drive traffic into next year?", "Brian Cornell", "Greg, let me start on the grocery side, and clearly we have more work to do there. But we feel like we're making very good progress. Changes we made to assortment, improvements we made to the quality of our produce items and we're certainly pleased with the reaction we're seeing as we enhance the experience in our LA 25 stores.", "That being the case, we've got to continue to make sure we build a greater connection with our guests as it pertains to the convenience food offering we provide. And Mark and I are working closely on the next phase of our grocery evolution to make sure that we continue to provide the right assortments, the right value, the right quality our guests expect from Target while they are shopping our stores. So you'll see a lot more of that when we get together in February, but we recognize that's an area that we've got to continue to drive progress in.", "From a loyalty standpoint, we are working very closely with the marketing team to ensure that when we get together with you in February, we\u2019ll be able to talk about the next iteration of our personalization and loyalty programs. Key to that Greg is bringing together some of the great assets we already have in place, leveraging our REDcard, leveraging cartwheel, which continues to see great response from the guests, and making it easy for the guests to leverage the existing loyalty assets we have in place.", "So we think that's the key unlock as we go into 2017 and beyond and that will be a key topic of the conversation when we see you in February.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brendan [ph] Fletcher with Bernstein.", "Unidentified Analyst", "My first time caller long time listener, a great quarter guys. Fantastic.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Unidentified Analyst", "My question is who else can win in urban environments? I know you only have a few dots with the flexible formats, but we think you guys are pretty far ahead in terms of knowledge out how to run mass merchants in urban stores, and mostly your competitors or pharmacy stores who are good competitors, but boy they need a whole lot of price to make it work. Do you see somebody else who's dangerous around the corner for you for taking this spot [Ph] on cities, obviously besides Amazon going ever more urban?", "Brian Cornell", "Brendan, we are very focused on our own opportunity. And we're in 30 locations today we think we have the opportunity to enter many many new neighborhoods, and we're really focused on making sure we build the back end capabilities, in supply chain, in assortment management, the in-store operating capabilities it takes to run these smaller stores. But we think the unique opportunity we have is bringing the best of Target to these individual neighborhoods, making sure that we custom tailor assortment we bring the right assortment of apparel and home, baby and kids that's right for that neighbourhood, complement it with convenient boots, and household essentials that really make that local Target run impactful for the guests.", "So we're still learning we're very pleased with the feedback, but as we enter very competitive markets like New York, we're going to learn a lot from Tribeca, we\u2019ll take that to other locations. As we do more and more business, adjacent to college campuses, we\u2019ll understand more and more about the needs of the college student, but we really think right now we've got a unique opportunity to leverage this new footprint as a future growth element in our strategy and the guests continues to say, no thank you every time we enter a new neighborhoods.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs", "Matt Fassler", "Thanks a lot and good morning.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning, Matt", "Matt Fassler", "My question is focused on gross margin, where you really turned the corner, year-on-year when you back out the pharmacy business. You\u2019ll spoke to the impact of mix, but can you talk about the impact that you're seeing from cost cuts at the point of purchase for you, and how deep we are into that into that after where you expect that to be sustained going forward?", "Brian Cornell", "Matt, I'd start with, you know we feel really good about the way Mark and his team have managed gross margin throughout the quarter. But it's really a by-product of the strength we continue to see in those important signature categories, and both in-store but importantly online.", "Our growth has been led by apparel and home great strength and baby and kids, those important high-margin categories that drive differentiation for our brand. So the benefits that we're seeing gross margin are a byproduct of the strategy we've had in place and really making sure that we're building market share, we're bringing great style and design and newness to those signature categories and the payback has been margin expansion wall we continue to invest in value, and getting back to rebalancing our brand promise we're bringing tremendous product to the expect more side.", "And now, we've rebalance our value message on a pay less side. So we were able to invest in value throughout the third quarter and still see gross margin rate expansion. So we feel really good about the balance we're bringing there and think that could be sustained over time.", "Matt Fassler", "Thank you, Brian.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.", "John Zolidis", "Hi. Good morning. Great to see the sequential improvement in trends.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks John.", "John Zolidis", "Question about some of the metrics within the within the comp. Looking at the average unit retail up 3.5% and units per transaction is down. I noticed that that has been the case for about 10 consecutive quarters now. So I just curious you can talk about what's driving the average unit retail up and units per transaction down? Thank you. ", "Brian Cornell", "Again, John, it comes back to the mix of our business and the strength we're seeing particularly in categories like home. The strength we're seeing in apparel and accessories. Some of the strengths we're seeing in baby and kids. So, those are important categories. Obviously in many cases, higher ticket, still a great value for our guests but higher ticket. And obviously offset by some weakness we've seen in the grocery categories. So the mix is clearly impacting those metrics we're seeing. And we feel very good about the way that guest has reacted to the quality, the style and the value we're offering those signature categories.", "John Zolidis", "Is the e-commerce growth also a factor then I would imagine that's more focused in to the higher ticket [ph] categories?", "Brian Cornell", "And again, as we noted in our earlier comments while overall we saw our digital business grow by 26%. The bulk of that business, the high growth areas were in apparel and home. So again higher ticket items we feel really good about the progress we're making from a digital mix standpoint and that's also coming through in the metrics we're seeing.", "John Zolidis", "Great. Thanks and good luck.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Chris Horvers", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning, Chris.", "Chris Horvers", "I want to think about the shift of the digital promotion in the second to the third quarter. How larger contributor was that to your delta and comp performance in the third quarter versus second quarter. I ask this because if we look at these two quarters together that's the low end of your 4Q guide. And so, as we look ahead what are the, I guess, big efforts or big drivers that you think drive the business to potentially the higher end of that range. Is it is it to focus on your customer can shop more around events? Is it the merchandise inside, what drives the higher end of the comp outlook for 4Q?", "John Mulligan", "Chris, backing up and I know there are number of embedded questions there. One, there was some shift because of the promotion between Q2 and Q3. I'd really focus on the year-to-date number. Year to-date from a digital standpoint we've been growing at 20%. As we talked about earlier in the call, we're very pleased with the reaction we're seeing during key event periods back-to-college, back-to-school a very important period for us both in-store and online. And we think the combination of the investments we've made to improve ease functionality of our digital engagement and the fact that we're certainly showing the ability to win during key holiday and traumatic period that's the right balance for us going forward.", "So, I think digital is going to be an important part of our growth strategy going forward. We think digital is certainly the way our guests interfaces with the brand whether they're in store or online, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making. And our overall growth rate is approximately 2x the digital industry. So, we're building market share. We're winning during key seasons and we certainly expect that to be a key driver to our fourth quarter success.", "Chris Horvers", "And then, just one quick follow-up question, can you talk about how much, I think CVS was 60 or 70 basis points to the gross margin the third quarter, you're going to start to lap that in the fourth quarter. It sounds are sounds like you're guiding the flat. So just help us understand how that progresses out into the fourth quarter? Thanks very much.", "Cathy Smith", "Yes. So Chris, this is Cathy. As we said we're guiding for EBIT margin to be up about 10 basis points. We do -- CVS was a \u2013 we closed it remember about halfway through the fourth quarter last year. So we'll get a little bit of that impact still. The biggest driver in the fourth quarter as we said is SG&A. So we'll continue to see some improvement there and that's going to get that 10 basis points.", "Chris Horvers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robert Ohmes", "Good morning and congrats Brian and team. Great work in what's not been an easy environment.", "Brian Cornell", "Robert, we appreciate that. Thank you.", "Robert Ohmes", "The question I had was just -- was actually this might be more of a John Mulligan question. I was hoping John, you could maybe give a little more detail on what the opportunities are from here in terms of in stocks RFID, the stuff you're working on and sort of how that could support store cops issue in the fourth quarter and as you head into next year.", "John Mulligan", "Great question Robbie, I think the team has made a lot of progress. And as we said at least the way we measure it today our in-stocks, out of stock is actual number we can focus more on is at are historically low numbers, so we feel great about that. Having said that we think there continues to be significant opportunity for us. And I think we see opportunity first at a store level ensuring we always have what the guest wants when they walk in, because even though we've improved meaningfully there's still a lot of distance there to go.", "And then more important than that digitally ensuring we have the right unit at the right place for the guests whether they want to come in-store and pick it up whether we're going to shift that from a store or ship that from a fulfilment center. And today we're not completely optimized there either and so while we've seen great progress and there's absolutely benefit to the guest and their trust with us when they come into the store over time.", "We still think there's a lot of runway there for us to improve and you'll continue to see us focus on reliability and speed in our supply chain and those are the two things that we will continue to drive against over not only next year but the next several years.", "Robert Ohmes", "Great. Thanks so much.", "John Mulligan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.", "Dan Binder", "Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thank you. You highlighted that back-to-school was strong for you and it seems that the consumers are shopping Target when there is an event which could be good for holiday. But I'm curious what you saw in the in the post back-to-school period and just generally when you look back over the last year or so in between big events whether it's you know Memorial Day event or Father's Day event or search, what you're seeing those traffic trends between the big events?", "Brian Cornell", "Dan, its great question and obviously we feel really good about the support we receive during back-to-college and back-to-school. In those off holiday periods we've got to make sure we got the right balance between newness and those important style categories and great value in our household essentials and food. And Mark and his team have spent a tremendous amount of time reshaping our promotional strategies, making sure that both in our circular, but also in-store it's really clear to our guests that we've got this great combination of newness and style and the value our guests deserves and is looking for in those key household essential areas.", "So, we've done a lot of work in store. I think with Mark's leadership we're clarifying value on our end caps clear assortment that connects with a guest in those off holiday periods. So, I feel really good about the progress. You'll see more of that as we go into the fourth quarter. But why don\u2019t I let Mark talk about some of the work that he's been leading as we think about really ensuring that value message is very clear to our guests when they're walking our stores each week.", "Mark Tritton", "Yes, hi Brian thanks Dan. What we\u2019ve seen is like a really hyper competitive market in the first half of the year and it really made us take start to look at how do we represent and resonate value to our guests more readily. So what you're seeing emerging in third quarter and more in the fourth quarter and beyond is a representation not just a price and value in our circulars as Brian talked about but in store in showing the guest clearly see that value up front and center.", "So representation on our end caps increasing single price point, end caps to really generate above that value and really delivering on expect more pay or less. So this is a continuing trend and then that the spaces between the cases, and all events that you raised, as Brian said we are hyper focused on that, we've seen some strength and some of our options that we put in place and really looking forward to our plans about how do we continue guest traffic and love our post major events where we do win.", "Dan Binder", "And then if I could just another question, in the last quarter or two you've highlighted that the electronics business was I think about a 70 basis point hit to the comps, so I was just curious if you could help us understand what that looks like in Q3? And then on the scripts that you mentioned were getting better, trend wise it sounds positive but I was curious if you look at the script trends relative to what you were doing, when you were on the pharmacy business, if there's some sort of relevant measure you can give us there that would be helpful?", "Brian Cornell", "So let me start with E&E [ph], as I\u2019ve mentioned in my earlier comment, we feel really good about our plans for the fourth quarter. And obviously, entertainment electronics and toys are critically important gifting items for the fourth quarter, so again I think the work that Mark and his team have done to make sure working with our vendor partners we have a combination of new items exclusive items, items that are on trend, we've seen a great reaction to our toy and gifting catalog, and we think like that we are very well positioned for the fourth quarter. Those categories did trend downward in Q3, but the important part of the year is in front of us, and I think we're very well positioned.", "And from a script standpoint, we are still rebuilding the momentum in that space but sequentially we've seen improvement from Q1 to Q2 and Q3 and we recognize that with time as the brandings in place as our in-store marketing and the CVS marketing takes shape, we're going to be rebuilding and growing scripts in that very important part of our store. Operator, we've got time for one more call.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company", "Oliver Chen", "Hi, thanks. Some solid margin and inventory control, just wanted to ask you about fill in versus stock up. It\u2019s likely related to your -- the progress you made towards the value messaging so just curious about how you're feeling about that dynamic? And then I wanted you to try to brief us on the reality versus Amazon, the near term strategies in terms of you know how you'll be competitively position versus Amazon and the holiday season and then as you look to bricks and clicks in the seamless experience over the longer term for long-term investors what should, what should the key factors be as we engage in that share opportunity versus Amazon? Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Oliver, great way to wrap up the call. From up fill-in and stock-up standpoint, again the work that Mark just talked about on the value side is clearly addressing the, the fill-in guests. And I feel very good about the progress we've made and will continue to make in that state. I think to the broader question it\u2019s a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in New York City. We continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place and how that will allow us to be very competitive and continue to win in the current retail environment.", "We think the investments we are making in our stores are critically important and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guests. We've learned as I hope you have, guests still like physical stores and year-to-date still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. So we want to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service, we continue to elevate that experience in service and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. We think of strategy of moving into new neighborhoods whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses is a critical growth vehicle, and again the reaction we've seen every time we open up a store in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and certainly in New York tells us our guests love the convenience of having Target right there in their neighbourhood.", "But we're also continuing to make investments online and we want to make sure we continue to give our guests, the choice of shopping anyway they want, the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter, but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfilment centers as we go into this holiday season, well over a thousand locations will be locations that not only you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile, we think that's a huge competitive advantage.", "So we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. We think it's a strategy that will win not only in the short term but over the long term and we look forward to seeing all of you in New York in February.", "So with that operator, we're going to wrap up our third quarter call. I appreciate everyone participating, and we look forward to see you in New York in February.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 17, 2017.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on Target\u2019s first quarter performance and our plans and priorities going forward. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.", "As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations Web site.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the first quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. At our financial community meeting, in February, we outlined our multi-year plan to position Target to deliver consistent growth, market share gains and outstanding financial performance over the long-term. This plan includes capital investments of more than $7 billion over the next three years, focused on continued investments in technology and our supply chain to build a smart network; a network that leverages all of our store and distribution assets to serve our guests more quickly and flexibly in every channel.", "Investments to re-imagine the shopping experience in more than 600 of our existing stores and the addition of more than 100 new small format locations around the country. On top of these capital investments, we discussed our plan to invest $1 billion of operating margin this year to allow us to move faster and support of our strategic priorities. We said our biggest operating investment will be in our team, equipping them to deliver enhanced service, convenience and deeper product expertise; as we prepare for the launch of 12 new and exciting brands over the next two years.", "Beyond these expense investments, we outline our expectation for gross margin pressure, resulting from the continued rapid increase in digital fulfillment combined with the price investments to support our everyday value proposition in key categories. Among all the things we covered in detailed at the meeting, one message I don't believe we emphasize enough, is our continued commitments to strong execution, everyday and every part of our business.", "While we certainly need to focus intently on delivering our long-term commitments, we need to maintain an equal focus on maximizing the performance of our business every day, both in store and online, delivering for our guests and our shareholders. So I want to thank our team for very strong execution in the first quarter in a very choppy environment. They delivered sales and profitability that was meaningfully better than our expectations.", "In February, we provided first quarter and full year guidance. We emphasize that our goal is to plan prudently and prepare to chase business when the opportunity arises. And that's exactly what happened in the first quarter, following very soft trends in late-January and into February, we saw an acceleration beginning in late February which was offset by better than expected sales in March and April. While our comp sales were strongest in April, if we adjust for the Easter shift, we saw our best results in March.", "While we were pleased that our first quarter financial performance was better than expectations, our results are not where we want them to be, and we have much more work to do. Week-to-week results have been volatile since Christmas and overall traffic declined nearly 1% in the first quarter. Along with this traffic decline, comp sales in both essentials and food and beverages were down as well. As we've mentioned in previous calls, we believe that consumer perception of value at Target have not reflected how well or out-the-door prices really are. As a result, we\u2019re in the early stages of implementing merchandising and marketing efforts to improve Target's value perception with guests and reestablish everyday price credibility on key items.", "As we implement those changes, we plan to measure carefully and adjust based on how guest respond. To support these efforts in our marketing, late in first quarter, we launched a new ad campaign focused on our convenient and low price assortment of everyday items. Reminding guests they can save time and money by making a Target run to their nearby store. And for guest that prefer to get their essentials at home, we recently announced that we're testing Target Restock, which will allow guests to order a large box filled with items they choose from a selection of thousands of essential items. We've been testing this service for team members here in the Twin Cities and we're preparing to extend this test to local Red Card holders in the near future. While some specifics to the offer have yet to be finalized, we expect to have a very competitive service compared with alternatives that are already in the marketplace.", "Beyond essentials, we are focused on growing the signature portion of our business and we continue to be pleased with the performance of Cat & Jack and Pillowfort, the new apparel and home brands we launched for the kids last year.", "Based on our insights from last year's launches, Mark and his team are preparing to rollout additional brands later in the year as part of our plan to launch 12 new brands across our signature categories over the next two years.", "Beyond these efforts to re-imagine our exclusive brand portfolio, we continue to find new opportunities to partner with world class designers and brands and deliver unique style and unbeatable value for our guests. In the first quarter, we were pleased with the results from our limited time partnership with Victoria Beckham, which proved to be one of the single biggest partnerships in our history.", "In the digital channel, sales increased 22% in the first quarter, much faster than the growth rate of the industry. Mike McNamara and his team continue to work closely with both John\u2019s team and Mark\u2019s team to develop and roll out new capabilities, highlight our differentiated assortment and elevate the guest experience by providing more speed and convenience.", "We invested nearly $500 million of capital in the first quarter and we\u2019re on track to invest more than $2 billion this year. Our technology and supply chain investments are focused on delivering a superior guest experience in every channel. In addition to new capabilities like Target Restock, we provide convenience we\u2019re working to deliver a more inspirational digital experience, like the 360 degree shopping experience we just launched on our site.", "This capability was delivered by our CGI team and we\u2019re investing to grow that team so we can rapidly roll-out additional experiences overtime. Beyond our continued investments in technology and supply chain, we\u2019re in the early stages of work to transform our existing store base and add to our portfolio of new small format stores around the country.", "In the first quarter, we completed 21 existing store remodels and opened four new small format locations. For the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver our goal to complete 100 remodels and add 30 small format stores. I personally visited many of these locations and the results look terrific. As we described in February, we are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates robust cash flow.", "Unlike many competitors, we have the resource to allow us to invest in the transformation of our business and position Target to compete in this new era in retail. Because our business is so strong, we expect to fund these long-term investments while continuing to support our dividend and annual dividend growth even during the period of transition. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we\u2019re committed to maintaining the cautious posture that service well in the first quarter. While consumer spending growth remains strong, we\u2019re seeing a continued shift towards experience, which is absorbing a meaningful portion of that growth.", "In addition to these consumer headwinds, we expect to see continued pressure from competitive closings and liquidations, which represent a long-term opportunity but defers consumer spending in the near-term. And finally, our efforts to enhance value perception and regain everyday price credibility will likely create some near-term headwinds before we gain traction overtime.", "So now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the team who will provide additional detail on our performance and focus going forward. Later in the call, Mark will cover category performance and his team\u2019s efforts to support both sides of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. Then Cathy will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and expectations for the second quarter and beyond. But first, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to John who will cover the team\u2019s current efforts to modernize the supply chain in best and our store shopping experience and realize new capabilities for our guest. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks Brian. This morning, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our progress in rapidly testing and rolling out supply chain and technology innovations. These innovations are designed to provide more convenience, inspiration and faster fulfillment on behalf of our guests, regardless of how they choose to shop. Then I\u2019ll highlight investments we\u2019re making in our stores to re-imagine the shopping experience and roll-out new capabilities that will help us drive sales in all channels.", "In our supply chain and technology areas, our teams are moving quickly, testing and iterating on our ability to increase speed and offer new services for our guests. In our Tribeca store in New York City, we are ready to begin a test in which we will offer same day delivery to guest at that store. At checkout, guests will have the option to choose to have their orders delivered to their home later that day in a scheduled delivery window of their choice. This test presents an opportunity to gauge guest demand for this service. In a high traffic location filled with urban guests who will appreciate the convenience. Through this test, we will begin insights about potential operational challenges and determine appropriate pricing and delivery windows based on guest preferences. This will help us to understand the potential to rollout a similar service more broadly overtime.", "When I moved into my role leading operations, one the first things I've learned is that any supply chain test has to be accomplished in tandem with our current operations. As a result, we have to be very thoughtful about how we conduct the test, because we don't want to make changes that might impair day-to-day reliability. In the second quarter, we plan to open a new facility in the North East that will allow us to test differentiated distribution capabilities, including store replenishment based on the appropriate unit of measure on every item, including palettes, key specs and niches. By testing out of a separate facility, we can implement without disrupting day-to-day operations in any of our current facilities.", "This new facility will help us learn quickly about both opportunities and complexities associated with this new distribution model. I want to stress that we're opening this facility so we can test and learn quickly, not to create new capacity. In fact, given our opportunity to continue increasing the speed and flexibility of our entire supply chain and leverage our stores to enable digital fulfillment, we have ample capacity within our current network to grow for many years. As we gain insights from the test in this separate facility, we will be better informed and prepared to rollout this new model into existing facilities overtime.", "Prior to the launch of the new East Coast facility, we have been testing daily customer replenishment based on niches in a single store here in the Twin Cities market. This store has much lower volume than our stores in the North East, which provided us some much lower risk environment for this early test. Results have been encouraging as we've been able to dramatically reduce store labor dedicated to unloading trucks and stocking the sales floor freeing up time for the team to focus on serving guests.", "In addition, we've been able to reduce inventory meaningfully and nearly eliminate backroom inventory of the items included in the test. And that's just some early bumps we've done so without affecting out stocks. With these insights, we are ready to move onto the next stage of testing with the new facility, and the team is eager to begin evaluating the results. With a faster and more reliable supply chain, we can develop new ways to leverage our stores and enhance convenience for our guests.", "An example is our upcoming pilot of Target Restock, which will begin rolling out to Twin City's Red Card holders this quarter. This service allows guests to order a restock shipping box filled with essential items, like toothpaste, diapers, coffee and cereal and have been delivered to their homes quickly for a low flat fee. For the pilot, guests will have access to more than 8,000 items and will continue to experiment expand the offering based on our learnings and guest feedback. Because the items we package and deliver from a nearby store, orders placed before 1:30 pm will be delivered on the following business day. We built the Target restock site and supporting back-end operations for Twin Cities\u2019 team member test in just 35 days. Based on what we've learned in that test, we will launch an enhanced site for the Twin Cities\u2019 pilot and continue to iterate on the experience.", "As we discussed at our Analyst Day, we believe that the future retail is both digital and physical and successful retailers will need to provide an outstanding experience in both. That\u2019s why we're moving quickly to elevate both the digital and in-store shopping experience, driving guest engagement and sales in every channel. For digital shopping, the challenge is to make it more experiential, delivering more of the inspiration you can find in a physical store. To elevate the digital experience in furniture and d\u00e9cor, which are already large and growing online businesses for us, we recently rolled out 360 degree shoppable living room, which serve as a digital showroom. Seeing the products staged in rooms in relation to other products helps guests to better understand the size and style of an item making it easier to shop. The experience will initially present about 120 products across four design aesthetics.", "As you know, more than 40% of our digital volume already runs through our stores, and we peaked at more than 80% last holiday season because we can offer both order pickup and ship orders directly from our stores. While all of our stores have offered order pick up for several years, we\u2019ve worked hard to improve the experience and encourage repeat uses by our guests. And we\u2019ve seen a pay off from these efforts.", "In the first quarter, more than 95% of in-store pick up orders were ready for guests in an hour less, up more than 3 percentage points from a year ago. Our net promoter score for the order pickup experience is improving steadily and is now actually higher than the score for our stores overall. In light of these trends, it's not surprising that repeat usage of order pickup has increased meaningfully compared with the year ago.", "First quarter ship from store volume was more than double last year\u2019s amount, accounting for 27% of our digital sales. This growth was partially driven by approximately 600 shipped from store locations and we\u2019ve added since last year. However, the increase was also driven by additional volume running through stores that had this capability for more than a year. Specifically, for the 460 stores that were shipping directly to guests in the first quarter last year, year-over-year growth in shipped from store volume was 32% this quarter.", "We continue to be very pleased with the ability of our stores to accommodate these higher volumes, and our supply chain team is enhancing end-to-end processes to allow for additional volume overtime. And importantly, the ability to ship directly from stores to nearby guests reduces our last mile shipping cost dramatically. Beyond digital capabilities in our stores, we are also investing in our team in the front of the store. We\u2019re providing tools and changing processes to enhance our team\u2019s availability on the sales force and making sure they are available during all hours the store is open.", "In addition, we\u2019re investing in training to equip our store team member with more product expertise in key areas like food and beverage, beauty, apparel and electronics. And of course, we\u2019d begun investing in our existing stores to elevate the physical environment along with our level of service. Given that, our 21 first quarter remodels will only continue recently, we don\u2019t yet have a statistically significant read on post remodel performance, but early results are very encouraging.", "However, for the set of remodels we completed last fall, we have been measuring overall results in line with our expected 2% to 4% lift following completion. Most encouraging for the 10 fold remodels in which the layout is more similar to the new layout we will roll out in Houston later this year, we have seen lifts near the high-end of that range. It's also important to note that we have a customized approach to remodels, and we have a low cost, high impact model that we can bring to our lower volume stores.", "Even on lower investment in the range of $3 million, there is a meaningful change in the look and feel of the store and we see guest respond to that change, driving very healthy lifts in the 2% to 4% range as well. Finally, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new small format stores, which generate more than double the per foot sales productivity of our larger format stores. While we\u2019re happy with the performance of these smaller stores when they open, what\u2019s most encouraging is the continued growth we\u2019re seeing when the stores become mature.", "Specifically, for our 10 mature small format stores, we are seeing double-digit comp increases on average so far this year. So I hope it's clear that our team is busy and energized, moving quickly with purpose to improve speed and agility to better serve our guests in every channel. Despite a challenging environment, I've never seen the team more focused on what need to deliver and more confident in our path forward.", "Now, I'll turn call over to Mark, who'll provide more details on our performance and plans in merchandizing. Mark?", "Mark Tritton", "Thanks, John. As Brian mentioned earlier, we have seen very choppy trends since the end of the holiday season, and our team has moved quickly to adjusting real time. We've began seeing signs of improvement in late February and we've saw the strongest performance compared with our forecast in March.", "We've maintained solid results in April, benefitting from both our Victoria Beckham partnership and the Easter holiday. As we've said many times, Target is a holiday destination and we've certainly saw that journey in Easter season. We saw the strongest growth in Candy and Easter day call, but we're also pleased with performance in toys and kids' apparel in the weeks leading up to the holiday.", "And then this Victoria Beckham; given the brand she has created, we need that our partnership with her would be big and have delivered. More than half of our Victoria Beckham sales were made up by our most loyal guests. And in five cities we hosted our best Red Card Guests at exclusive events, providing early access to her products. Victoria Beckham baskets were more than twice the size of our average transaction and they weren\u2019t just focused on her items. In fact, there were nearly balanced between Victoria Beckham items and items from our broader assortment. And not surprisingly, her items sold particularly well first online.", "Overall, we are very pleased with the results of this partnership, which has proven to be one of the biggest in our history. While macro factors likely drove some of the acceleration in March and April, we also saw the impact of warmer weather on our seasonal categories and our electronics business lift forward with the launch of the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo has long been aligned with our brand given their history of delivering hardware and games are entitled around activity and families. We worked closely with Nintendo team to launch the Switch supported by a multi-fascinated marketing plan that was a visible both inside and outside our source.", "We also supported the launch online and saw great results by delivering a bundled offer for the Switch on our site. As a result, these efforts we've enjoyed a mid-teens market share in Switch since the launch. This is the great example of the power for successful collaboration with a national brand and why we love to partner with world class brands to create Target unique differentiated experiences for consumers.", "Beyond video games, electronics also benefited from healthy growth in Apple Watch and iPhone during the quarter. As a result, for the first quarter in total, electronics delivered a mid-single digit comp sales increase, the strongest in three years. In apparel, trends have been challenging across the industry and we saw a small decline at apparel comps in the first quarter. However, when we compare our results to the industry, we continue to measure meaningful market share gains.", "Last year, our apparel sales and market share gains were heavily concentrated in women's ready-to-wear and kids' apparel. This year, those categories continue to gain share, but we're also seeing gains across all of the subcategories, including, men's apparel, intimates and performance activewear. Trends in activewear have improved meaningfully since the relaunch of our C9 brand after the holiday season.", "Swim is another big first quarter story in apparel, and we expect that to continue all year. As you know, we already have the number one unit share in swim. But as other retailers begin closing and exiting this business, we saw a big opportunity to gain an even stronger position. Our team worked quickly to launch our new brand Shade & Shore, which has delivered strong results in its launch. Given this momentum, we expect to see continued growth in swim in the second quarter and beyond.", "For our less discretionary essentials and food beverage businesses, first quarter market share trends were more challenging. For the quarter, we saw low single digit comp declines in both of these business and we are taking steps to regain our value and every day price perception in both of these. This would begin in the first quarter and we recently launched our TargetRun and Done marketing campaign to support that work, but we have much more to do. In the second quarter and beyond, we will continue to invest in our regular prices and reinforce our everyday positioning. An important part of that work is to adjust our promotional posture on those items and categories so they better support everyday message.", "In addition, we will work to balance our promotional posture between stock up offers and factors important for fielding trips, including an emphasis on individual items and low opening price points. I want to stress that this work is very detailed and surgical. There isn\u2019t a single solution across items and categories so that our team will be testing and iterating at a very granule level and they will be expanding the scope of their work as the year progresses.", "Importantly, as Brian mentioned, as we are implementing these changes, we may see added pressure before we begin to see the benefits. However, we know this is the right thing to do and we\u2019re committed to making these changes to better position our business over the long-term. More value in everyday price perception are a challenge in our food and beverage category, I want to stress that we are seeing a couple of bright spots. First, we saw a small increase in produce comps in the first quarter, reflecting the work we\u2019ve done to gain credibility in this key part of the assortment.", "We have worked with the projects vendors to reduce the time from their fields to our network and John\u2019s team has increased the speed of produce items into our stores once they reach that network. As a result, freshness and in stocks have been improving. We\u2019re also benefitting from the work in our stores to higher grocery experts and organize specialized teams who now own the end-to-end process in those stores. Another great bright spot is our adult beverage business, which saw a mid single digit comp increase this quarter. We continue to focus on developing localized assortments and more compelling displays, and our guests are really responding.", "We plan to expand space for adult beverage in more than 100 additional stores in the second quarter with more planned to the third quarter and beyond. I also want to pause and welcome Jeff Burt who joined us in April to lead our food and beverage team. Jeff comes to us with more than 30 years or grocery experience, most recently leading Fred Meyer. Jeff is off to a great start, and I look forward to working with him to further strengthen this business overtime.", "At our financial community meeting, in February, we announced our plan to roll out 12 new exclusive brands across our signature categories through next year, and we\u2019re getting ready to launch the first of those brands later this month. It's called Cloud Island, and it\u2019s a new exclusive line of nursery d\u00e9cor, bedding, bath and layette products designed by our own internal design team. We build this collection of more than 500 items to be both stylish and affordable with a focus on safety, durability and comfort.", "We\u2019ll roll out the d\u00e9cor and bedding items to all stores and our five beginning May 28th and we\u2019ll follow with the bath and layout pieces later in the summer. This new brand is a natural addition to the successful kids\u2019 brands we launched last year Pillorfort and Cat & Jack, which continued to perform really well. The guest response to Cat & Jack, in particular, has been amazing. Among guest who purchased kids apparel for Target in the months leading up to the launch of this new brand, spending on kids' apparel increased more than 50% in the months following the launch.", "This increase in spend was driven by both frequency and spend per visit. Even more encouraging, the launch board in NGN traffic to the whole category, leading to an increase in spending on kids closet Target even among guests who didn't by Cat & Jack. This shows why we are so excited about our plans to launch additional signature category brands later in the year and even more next year.", "So in closing, let me leave you with a final thought. We understand that we are in the midst of very challenging period in retail and we're in the early stages of our plans to transform our business. That said you wouldn't feel that why if you interacted with our team, they're energized and hungry to win and focused on doing what it takes to get there.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance and outlook for the second quarter and full year. Cathy?", "Cathy Smith", "Thanks Mark. When we provided first quarter guidance at our financial community meeting, we described the challenging results we had seen so far in February. At the time, there were theories for why things might improve, but we felt it was best to plan for those challenging trends to continue and react quickly if conditions improved.", "As we look ahead, we believe it's appropriate to continue to take this cautious approach as we plan for the rest of the year. After all, the environment remains volatile and the disruption from competitor closings doesn't look like it will change anytime soon. For the first quarter, comparable sale fell 1.3%, a little over half of this decline was driven by traffic, combined with a small decrease in average ticket. As we've said many times, traffic is the key metric for us, so we're taking steps this year to put us on the path back to growth overtime.", "First quarter gross margin rate was down about 40 basis points to last year, driven by increased fulfillment cost resulting from the growth in our digital sales. Merchandise mix had a roughly neutral effect on our gross margin rate this quarter, reflecting the acceleration in electronics that Mark described earlier. While gross margin dollars declined about $130 million from last year, this performance was much better than expected, driven by better than expected sales and fewer clearance markdowns compared with our plans.", "On the SG&A expense line, first quarter dollars and rates were better than expected as well. Consistent with our plan for the year, we began ramping up store labor on the sales floor. But in the first quarter, those investments in front-end labor were offset by savings in backroom logistics. In addition, we saw some timing favorability on several expense lines in the first quarter, which we now expect to see in the second quarter.", "Our first quarter depreciation and amortization rate was up about 20 basis points compared with last year, reflecting increased costs from our remodel program on a lower base of sale. Altogether, our EBIT rate was 7.4% in the quarter, down from a very strong 8.2% last quarter. At the end of the quarter, inventory was more than 5% lower than a year ago, reflecting the early impact of our work to increase the speed of our supply chain. As I've mentioned before, we believe we have a compelling opportunity to free up working capital overtime by increasing the speed and accuracy of our supply chain. We're in the beginning stages of that journey, but it is encouraging to see early signs of progress.", "As Brian mentioned, we invested just under $500 million of capital in the first quarter, a portion of these investments was focused on our stores as we started to transform the shopping experience in existing locations. In addition, we continue to grow our portfolio of small format stores.", "We also invested in supply chain and technology to support new capabilities, including those John described earlier. For the year, we will continue to focus our investments on these priorities and we expect our full year CapEx will be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. On top of expenditures for new capital, we paid more than $330 million in dividends in the first quarter, and repurchased just over $300 million of our stock, primarily through a pre-existing trading plan that was put in place last year.", "As we consider full year capital deployment and cash flow compared with last year, higher CapEx and lower EBITDA will certainly put some downward pressure on cash flow. However, we also expect some offset in tailwinds in 2017 as we continue to reduce working capital.", "Altogether, as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we expect to continue to have ample capacity to support the dividend and grow annually. And overtime, to the extent we have excess cash beyond CapEx and dividends, within the limits of our current debt ratings we expect to have the capacity to repurchase our shares. However, given the recent changes in our operating model, we will stay relatively cautious about the pace of share repurchase in the near term.", "My final comment on the first quarter is in reference to our return on invested capital. We earned an after tax ROIC of 14.2% in the 12 months through the end of the first quarter. I hope you'd agree that is healthy performance in any industry and any environment, but it's also slightly better than Target's ROIC through the first quarter of last year, excluding the one-time gain from our sale of our pharmacy business. I think that's helpful perspective as we move through a year of meaningful transformation. We are blessed to have a business that continues to generate good returns and have a strong balance sheet. That powerful combination gives us the flexibility to make changes that will position our business for continued success in this rapidly changing period in retail.", "Now, let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We are planning for a low-single digit decline in comparable sales in the second quarter. Just like the decision we face in the first quarter, we could plan for a more optimistic scenario but that would create undue risk in a very choppy environment. On the EBIT line, we are planning for a decline of just over $200 million compared with last year. We expect SG&A expense to be the primary driver of that decline as we continue to invest in store service and new capabilities, and we see the impact of the timing shift on several expense lines from the first quarter.", "On the EPS line, these expectations translate to a range of $0.95 to $1.15 for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in the second quarter. For the full year, we are not updating our prior guidance. As a reminder, that guidance anticipates a low-single digit decline in comparable sales for the year and adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $4.20. Clearly, given that first quarter performance exceeded our expectations, there is a higher chance that we'll finish the year in the upper end of that range. However, with most of the year still ahead of us and the prospects for continued near term headwind, we believe these expectations are still appropriate.", "Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to thank you for your continued engagement and support. Following our financial community meeting, we\u2019ve heard from many of you and as always, we appreciate your perspective. What's most encouraging is your support of our strategy and the steps we're taking to position our business for the long-term. Just as we do, you clearly see the risks and challenges in this environment. So it's been very helpful to know that you also believe in our strategy and the long-term investments we are making in our business.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.", "Brian Cornell", "Before we turn to questions, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. First, while we're certainly pleased that Target's first quarter performance was better than expectations, we're not due any high fives in the room here today. Our first quarter performance is not what we expect to deliver overtime, and we're investing and moving quickly to deliver stronger, more consistent results in the future.", "When we look ahead, we do so with our eyes wide open, aware of the challenges we're facing. But when I interact with our team, I see a lot of energy and optimism, a desire to deliver for our guests and win in the marketplace. What's most encouraging is the team's agility and responsiveness in a rapidly changing environment. When we're talking about the development of Target Restock by our technology and operations teams; the rollout of a new ad campaign by Target Run and Done from our marketing team; or the development and launch of a new brand like Shade & Shore for our merchandising team; everyone is focused on innovating rapidly like never before. I'm continually proud and impressed by what this team can accomplish.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, John, Mark, Cathy and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. ", "Paul Trussell", "Wanted to just inquire about the initial guidance given this year around the $1 billion investment; you mentioned some timing factors between SG&A in 1Q and 2Q. But even looking at the guidance provided for 2Q, the first half is certainly running at a run-rate below that of $1 billion in investments. Help us just understand have there been meaningful offsets, or should we expect a spike perhaps in that investment pace in the second half?", "Brian Cornell", "We're very focused on executing the plan we've laid out back on February 28th. So you\u2019re going to continue to see us invest in store labor; making sure our standards continue to improve; and we saw very strong progress in the first quarter; invest in value, and continue to invest in the growth of our digital business. So over the course of the year, we're committed to executing against that plan. We'll see that continue over the second, third and fourth quarter. But the plan we've lead out back in February is the plan we're going to continue to focus on executing throughout the year.", "Our overall focus is continue to see traffic patterns grow in our stores, improve and accelerate our digital performance; we want to make sure we're capturing market share as we did in the first quarter; continue to build and invest in our brands; and ultimately, improve our value proposition with the guest. So there is going to be no change to the plan we lead out in February. We're committed to executing and making those investments over the balance of the year.", "Paul Trussell", "Thank you for that color. And just as a quick follow up, Cathy, you gave guidance for negative low-single digit comps in 2Q. Just help us understand some more of the puts and takes from a category standpoint. How are you guys focused on improving traffic trends back into positive side -- on the positive standpoint and then also specifically if you can speak on food aiming essentials, is really what I will let to dig on how we get that positive as well? Thank you.", "Cathy Smith", "We are working to restore our positive traffic and more importantly preference over the long-term and I think that\u2019s everything you continue to hear us say. And so over the course of Q2, we\u2019re going to just keep doing what we said we would do, and that is we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re continuing to invest in a great experience for our guest, both online and in stores and you will see us doing that. Mark and the team has some really exciting things coming into Q2, but don\u2019t want to just miss the positives we saw around the category mix in Q1 even. So I was just going to tell you we\u2019re just in this for the longhaul, we\u2019re going to keep doing what we said we would do and restoring positive traffics high on our priority list. Mark, do you want to talk about anything in particular with regards to food and beverage?", "Mark Tritton", "Paul, in terms of the promotional posture and the price value equation, we\u2019ve made some rapid changes in a number of our signature categories. But probably the key areas that we\u2019re focusing on of course the food and beverage and essentials. So we\u2019ve been testing righting quickly since Q4 and then in Q1, and we\u2019ll see an evolving pattern of change and evolution on we\u2019ll roll out. But the communication to the guest and the simplification of our everyday price positioning, and you\u2019ll see that evolve more deeply in Q2 and then beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simeon Gutman", "So just to follow up on the guidance for the second quarter, can you just talk about the change in momentum that you experienced in March. Do you think that was the environment improving or was it some of your actions? You mentioned, I think Victoria Beckham and I don\u2019t think these things have been material, but I know that that product line came in March. And I don\u2019t know the timing of electronics and switch. And then that compares I believe get easier or got easier in April and stay relatively easy for the quarter. Can you give us a sense, is the run rate deteriorating or is your outlook just being conservative at this point?", "Brian Cornell", "Simeon, let me start by really summarizing Q1 performance. And certainly, I think we saw some changes in the overall macro environment. But I also saw -- we also saw very strong execution, both from a digital standpoint where we grew the business by 22% but also meaningful changes in store. And I think our store standards and our store execution continues to improve. I also think we showed great adaptability in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll let Mark talk about some of the successes we saw in categories like apparel. But I\u2019d highlight the efforts that we put behind our swim business where we start at number one share position, but we saw changes the marketplace competitive closures, competitive exits.", "And as we talked about back in February, we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of marketshare opportunities over the next two or three years. And this is a great example where Mark and his team recognized the consumer opportunity, saw changes in the competitive environment, quickly built a brand by partnering with our vendors, and introduced Shade & Shore during the first quarter, which allowed us to take even more marketshare in swim. And it\u2019s a great example of the work that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on over the next few years.", "Looking at the market, recognizing where we have competitive opportunities, where we can gain share and how we use both our digital and physical channels to meet the needs of the guest. Mark, what don\u2019t you just spend a few minutes, just talking about the work you and the team did to take advantage of the opportunity in Q1 with swim?", "Mark Tritton", "Yes, I think it's a great example of where we're excited about our new brand launches as we've been testing, learning and constantly iterating to create new ideas and they've really resonating with our guests. So as Brian talked about, the story here is really one about agility and marketing insight. So where we're already had a strong number one unit market positioning in swim, we didn't rest on our laurels, similarly to action in Kids. And we looked at this market with declining players and saw an opportunity to win even further.", "So we looked at deep guest insights, market insight and worked really clearly closely with our vendor insights to create a new brand, a new paradigm and a new service level for our guests, all in a very rapid period of time. Launching Q1 Shade & Shore gain share and half amongst of our guests has creating accelerated growth, and real confidence for us as we do build our brand portfolio. And it's important to notice, as Brian said, this was an omnichannel play. So we looked at both stores and online to meet the guest needs and get exemplary results.", "Simeon Gutman", "And my follow-up\u2026", "Brian Cornell", "More work to do as we go into Q2. And as we talked about during our prepared comments, Q1 we've remodeled 21 stores; we have got much more work to do over the balance of the year; we opened up four new small formats; we started to make very surgical investments in value; and simplify our value communication in store and amplify that with a new advertising campaign that we called Target Run and Done. So in the early stages, we're going to continue to build off of that. We want to make progress every quarter, but we recognize it's going to take time.", "And we're going to stay very focused, very measured against the initiatives we've lead out. And quarter-by-quarter, we're going to strengthen our performance, continue to drive traffic to our stores, more visits to our site and capture market share as we improve our value perception and continue to build proprietary brands within our portfolio.", "Simeon Gutman", "And then if I could ask one follow up on investments, you mentioned you're starting to make some value investments. Can you give us any color on timeframe, on categories, is it broad based? And back to the earlier question, it looks like this quarter the decline in EBIT looked commensurate with the comp decline. It didn't look like this was a big period of investment. I think behind the scenes, there might be that we don't see. So just curious of how we should lay that out for the rest of the year?", "Brian Cornell", "Mark and Cathy have both discussed, we are making investments in value; very much focused on helpful essentials and food and beverage; those are going to continue over the balance of the year; and we're going to be very surgical; we're going to measure and iterate; we've already made some significant progress in simplifying our overall value and promo communication; and now we\u2019re enhancing it with additional advertising dedicated to those core household essential items that drive trips to our stores. So you\u2019re going to continue to see that focus not only over the balance of this year but overtime.", "Cathy Smith", "Maybe, Simeon, I'll add on just real quickly. So let\u2019s look at the SG&A line, in particular, to give you an example. We invested more hours in the store and store service and store experience, and obviously, we also invested in marketing. But it's being offset because of all of the work we're doing around in our supply chain and fulfillment, in the backrooms of our stores we're starting to see some of the benefits there. Again, we're early days of a long journey. But you are seeing some of that offset. So it doesn\u2019t show up as apparently on the SG&A. And then I\u2019d remind you to look at, clearly not where we want to be, but sales down slightly and EBIT down quite a bit more. So the investments are coming through, as we said, and it's not going to show up in any given quarter, it's going to show up over the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward Kelly", "Could you talk about how your strategy in food may evolve with hiring of Jeff Burt from Kroger? And I guess if you were to take a step back and really think about it. What are the two or three things that you really are looking for him to accomplish here?", "Brian Cornell", "Let me start. First of all, Jeff has only been on board for a handful of weeks, so still in the early period of time really trying to understand our business, assimilating to the Target environment. So we want to certainly give him plenty of time to assess our business and begin to build strategies, going forward. But I think it's important to recognize he\u2019s not starting from square one. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been very focused on improving the quality of our branch assortment. And the work that our merchandizing team and our supply chain team have done, we\u2019ve made significant progress in improving freshness evolving our assortment to make sure we have more organic natural gluten free items in our assortment in each and every category where we participate in food and beverage.", "As you heard us talk about time and time again over the last few quarters, we\u2019ve made significant progress in categories like adult beverages. So Jeff will build off of that work. We certainly recognize based on the work we\u2019ve done in Los Angeles with the LA 25 remodels and additional remodel activity in the Dallas, Fort Worth market that as we change the in-store environment and elevate the presentation, the guest is responding very, very well. So if we want to give Jeff plenty of time to take his own inventory, begin to build his own strategy that will enhance the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years. And we\u2019re very confident that overtime Jeff is going to build a plan that will allow us to continue to accelerate our performance in those important food and beverage categories.", "Edward Kelly", "Just a follow-up related to food, on Monday, there was an article in the journal about you guys I am sure you saw. There was a mention in there about maybe your interest in sprouts last year. I am just curious as to how do you think about acquisitions generally? And are you interested, willing and thinking about out of the box alternatives through maybe like M&A to reposition this business?", "Brian Cornell", "Ed, we look at M&A opportunities all the time, but we look at them through a filter of what\u2019s going to really enhance our current business initiatives. So I would put out of the box on the side and really think about M&A as something is going to compliment and strengthen our core strategy, help us accelerate complement the interaction we have with the Target guests, and we\u2019ll continue to look strategically at M&A opportunities overtime.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.", "Michael Lasser", "So, on the investments you\u2019re making this year. To what degree are you moderating and altering them based on the week-to-week and the sales trends that you're seeing? So if sales are better than expected, are you actually pulling back on some of those investments?", "Brian Cornell", "Michael, we are very focused on executing against the initiatives and investments we outlined earlier in the year. So we'll continue to iterate as we learn through our remodel experience, as we continue to open up new small formats. We learn every day as we develop new brands, but our focus remains the same. So you shouldn't expect to see any drastic changes. And we'll continue to mature those initiatives overtime.", "Cathy Smith", "And what I would say, Michael, is we're accelerating when we test and learn and validate we accelerate our investment into that area. And so that's where we're looking across the Company as only see an opportunity to accelerate something that's working along our strategy that's what we're doing.", "Brian Cornell", "But Michael, over the next couple of years, you should expect that to continue to focus on reimagining our existing stores; adding new small formats to bring us into urban market and on to college campuses; our continued investments in supply chain and technology; the support of our new brand that we'll be launching over the next 18 months; those commitments will not change and our focus is on execution. And I think what we saw in the first quarter is a company that's making progress; we still have a long way to go; but continuing to focus on executing each and every day, both in our physical and digital channel; and that's not going to change over the next few years.", "Michael Lasser", "Brian, within the grocery and essentials category, can you give us a sense where you think your pricing gap is to the market today? And where do you think it needs to be overtime?", "Brian Cornell", "I think that we started work here in earnest in Q4 and continuing with healthy work in Q1. We actually show our industries are actually closer than the guest gives us credit for. And that's an issue for us, because we know that's a bigger message that we need to covey.", "So we're continuing to sharpen our price and our value messaging at the same time and make sure that we move to more regional based pricing, localized pricing so we\u2019re more relevant to the guest in the competitive set, which is not what we're doing during \u201916 and we're rapidly iterated on in '17. So you see more of that activity and more of that benefit as we move through 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.", "Kate McShane", "With regards to moving to EDLP and value messaging, I just wondered how much that move weighed on margins in Q1 and where you're seeing more success in that move. And where you think you have more work to do? And then in that same context, I think you've noted before that there is some fits and starts with how you've communicated your value message. Can you explain how and what you did during Q1 to convey that better to your customer?", "Cathy Smith", "So I'm happy to start, Kate. Good morning. And then Mark can amplify as well. So on the impact that we saw coming through gross margin, as Mark shared and we've shared actually for a couple of quarters. Our biggest work has got to be around making sure that the value we're delivering is really clear. And it's going to take a while for our guests to give us a credit for that. And so that's the work that we're going to continuing to do. So while we're sharpening and making it more regionalized, you'll see that come through slightly. But the bigger effort is all of the work we're doing, and like the Target Run and Done campaign that we launched this last quarter and making sure that our guests recognize the value we are delivering.", "Brian Cornell", "I\u2019d just add into that, Kate. Our assets, as we\u2019ve discussed, are quite surgical. So we're doing this area-by-area, classification-by-classification as an involving transfer. And we've really begun those efforts through Q1 but more in the backend as we match to the Target Run and Done campaign. So what we're seeing here is that on the handle side, we've been, clearly we\u2019ve had up to 28 different handles that we've been using to resonate value across all our classification. So rationalizing the voice and the nomenclature down is part of that. So that's why we'll come into Q2 with an evolving position and we'll assess its impact and its opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Greg Melich", "I had a couple of questions; one, Cathy, sort of a housekeeping. You mentioned there was a timing issue in SG&A. Could you quantify how much that helped SG&A or how much we should expect it to come-in in the second quarter?", "Cathy Smith", "As we said in our Q2 remarks and guidance, we expect couple of hundred million dollars of EBIT decrease. And we also said that the majority of that would be in SG&A, so it's pretty, I think it's pretty safe to assume that that would be how I quantify the shift from Q1 into Q2.", "Greg Melich", "And then a bigger picture question, you talked a lot about traffic. But I don't think we've test yet on the loyalty programs and the frequency you could drive from Red Card and Cart wheel. And it\u2019s been a lot of change in the market, whether it's Amazon Prime or Costco with their new Credit card or Walmart with free shipping thresholds lowering. How are you guys thinking about integrating those programs to really help drive traffic? And is there a time this year that we should expect to see that maybe enhance or roll out?", "Brian Cornell", "Greg, we'll talk more about that in the second half of the year. We're spending a lot of time right now with Rick Gomez, who's now our Chief Marketing Officer really stepping back and thinking about loyalty and importantly, as you said the integration of the Red Card into that loyalty program. And one of the other highlights from the first quarter is the continued penetration growth of our Red Card. So we recognized that the very important asset that we need to leverage going forward. And Rick and his team are working right now to think about the next phase of loyalty and how we continue to leverage the Red Card to build even stronger relationship with our guests. So you\u2019re spot on and we'll talk about that much more in the second half of the year.", "Greg Melich", "And on sales, just a follow ups. It sounds like sales improved in March and April, but were still negative. I just want to make sure that's right?", "Brian Cornell", "Greg, we don't break out monthly sales. As we've said, we saw strengthening in the latter half of February, into March and April. But obviously, our comps were still down for the quarter. So we've had work to do. We're not satisfied with where we ended up. But we certainly feel good about the progress we made in the quarter; and importantly, the market share gains that we saw in very important signature categories. So we're focused on driving traffic. We are certainly committed to restoring positive comps throughout our system. But one of the other important metrics that we're going to be looking at every single quarter is how we're performing from a market share standpoint. And I feel very good about some of the market share gains that our team achieved in Q1. We're going to continue to focus on market share opportunities throughout the year.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from John Zolidis with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "John Zolidis", "Question on the performance of the smaller format stores, you mentioned that they had sales productivity roughly 2 times that of the larger more suburban base stores. Aside from the difference in either being an urban or suburban location. What do you attribute or what can you tell us about why the productivity of those boxes is so much better? And is there any learnings you can take from those small format stores to extend to the balance of the chain?", "Brian Cornell", "John, there is a lot of learnings that we're bringing forward from those small stores, not only as we expand into new markets but as we think about application to our traditional stores. I think the biggest learning is as we move into these new neighborhoods, consumers love Target and they love the brand. And the response we're seeing has been really outstanding. So we feel very good about our small format strategy as we move into new neighborhoods; we're getting better and better are curating and localizing assortment; understanding how to operate in various markets; and we're also encouraged to see the early top results as we lap some of the new small formats we opened up last year. So encouraging signs, and we're going to build off of that as we go forward.", "So we feel good about the progress we made in Q1. But as a team, we're not doing high fives. We know we've got a lot of work to do. But I think it's important as we aim to recognize, as a Company, we have a very strong foundation. And if you look at our results in the first quarter, we generated $16 billion of revenue. Our operating income was almost $1.2 billion. We are able to invest $500 million of CapEx and still see a very strong return on invested capital of over 14%. And as we did that, we're able to reduce inventories by over 5%. So we know we've got a lot of additional work to do. But I think it's important to recognize; we're a fundamentally sound Company; we've had a very clear strategy in place; and now our focus over the balance of the next three years is week-to-week execution, both from a physical and digital standpoint.", "So we appreciate you dial in today. We look forward to talking to you at the end of Q2. And operator, that concludes our call. Thank you.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 16, 2017. I would like to now turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on Target\u2019s second quarter performance and our plans and priorities going forward. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our second quarter performance and our priorities going forward. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which gives us increased confidence that we are focused on the right long-term strategy. Our team is energized and remains on track to deliver the ambitious agenda we laid out for the year, including the physical transformation more than 100 stores in 2017. On the way to transforming, more than 600 stores over a 3-year period, nearly doubling the number of small format stores are shared in support of our goal to open more than 100 new stores in dense urban, suburban and college campus neighborhoods over a 3-year period.", "Development and rollout of digital capabilities that will continue to drive Target\u2019s digial sales growth in excess of the industry, completely transforming our supply chain from end-to-end creating a smart network of stores and distribution facilities that will allow fast reliable fulfillment regardless of how our guests use the shop, rejuvenating our own brand portfolio by launching 12 brands over a 2-year period, replacing brands that represent more than $10 billion of our current sales volume, investing in systems, training and additional labor hours in our source enabling our team to provide an even better experience for our guests and enhancing our value perception among consumers by reducing promotions and highlighting the right everyday pricing in key categories. Later in the call, John, Mark and Cathy will provide more details on our efforts to advance each of these priorities.", "On our last conference call, I mentioned that beyond our focus on advancing our long-term priorities, we need to have equal focus on strong execution in every channel, everyday. That\u2019s why we are really proud of the execution by our team in the second quarter as they delivered better-than-expected performance in a continuing challenging environment. In particular, second quarter traffic, which was up more than 2% was much stronger than our expectations and better than recent trends and the strength was broad-based across the country, across categories and across channels. And while the consumer and competitive environment remains choppy better-than-expected performance occurred throughout the quarter and wasn\u2019t limited to a short period within the quarter, with better second quarter traffic, we saw improved performance across each of our 5 broad merchandising categories: apparel, home, food and beverage, essentials and hardlines. 4 of those 5 saw comp increases in the second quarter, while comp sales in food and beverage were flat. However, given continued competitive and deflationary pressure in food, we are pleased that we are seeing early signs of progress. Specifically, we saw really strong positive comps in adult beverages and produce in the second quarter, both categories in which we have identified opportunities and focused on improvement. The positive response from our guests demonstrates that we are making progress and we are taking additional steps to build on that momentum over time.", "I also want to call out our progress on pricing and promotions. As we mentioned in the last call, we undertook this effort with a long-term view knowing that we might create some headwinds in the near term. Specifically, as we move towards a stronger everyday price proposition in our business and pullback on excess promotions, we can expect an adjustment period before value perception proves and consumers respond. While we continue to face the risk in future quarters as we expand the scope of this work, it\u2019s notable that in the second quarter we saw a meaningful increase in the percent of our business done at regular price and a meaningful decline in the percent on promotion. This demonstrates the progress we have already made and gives us confidence we are on the right track.", "I also want to call out the team\u2019s progress on Target\u2019s digital capabilities which continue to show up in our results. Target\u2019s digital sales grew much faster than industry in the second quarter, up 32% on top of 16% growth last year. If you do the compounding of these two growth rates, you will see that this represents more than a 50% growth rate compared with 2 years ago. And importantly as a result of our comprehensive effort by our team to reduce friction and increase the reliability of our digital operations, we have seen meaningful declines in guest contact center activity related to digital. This is a tangible reflection of our work to create a stable digital platform and successful collaboration between our digital operations and merchandising teams to create a more cohesive experience for our guests.", "To build on this success the team is rapidly testing and rolling out additional fulfillment options for our guests. This includes Target Restock, our next day delivery option for everyday essentials that we recently rolled out the Twin City Red Card holders. It includes same day delivery which we began testing in our Tribeca store in the second quarter. It includes an early test of curbside fulfillment which we recently began testing with Twin City team members and which will expand to again facing tests in the third quarter. And of course our efforts include the expansion of ship and store locations, in-store pickup capabilities and our work with third-party providers to speed up ship times from our stores and distribution facilities. In each of these efforts the team is moving quickly, more quickly than ever before to rollout, test and iterate and expand where we see positive results. We are really excited to see the engagement of our team and the collaboration occurring across our operations which allows these tests to move quickly and we intend to continue moving quickly in the months ahead.", "Another area where we have increased our speed is the development and rollout of new exclusive brands with last year\u2019s rollout of Pillowfort and Cat & Jack in kids we demonstrated the power of reinvention in categories that were already performing well. Specifically both of these new brands grow double digit comps following their launch last year. Regarding the Cat & Jack brand, we have long said that it was on pace to exceed $1 billion in sales in its first year. The performance has actually exceeded those expectations. Cat & Jack just crossed the $2 billion mark only slightly more than a year after its launch. Based on the success of those brands, our team took on the ambitious goal of launching 12 additional new brands before the end of next year and those plans are coming to life.", "At the end of May we launched Cloud Island, an infant brand which we developed in partnership with our guests. And like last year\u2019s new brands Cloud Island has generated double digit comp increases in the period since the launch. In July we launched a new maternity brand Isabel Maternity and announced plans to launch four more brands in the third quarter crossing women\u2019s apparel, men\u2019s apparel and home. I also want to comment on our recently announced decision to partner with Casper in advance of the back to college season. I spent some time with the leadership team at Casper and I have been really impressed with how they think long-term and focus on outstanding execution on behalf of their customers. Their brand and products are a great fit with the Target brands and we are proud to be featuring their products online and in our stores, including a couple of exclusive items they have developed only for Target. This relationship is the most recent example of our ability to differentiate our assortment while helping outstanding brands to extend their reach.", "During this period of rapid transformation in retail in which many others are shrinking, we will continue to look for ways to partner and deliver incremental growth for high quality brands while delivering differentiation and value for our guests. As we look ahead, we are committed to continued progress against our long-term goals. And we expect the environment will continue to be challenging. The pace of change in the consumer and competitive environment doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down. And we are well positioned to emerge as one of the winners in retail. It starts with the underlying health of our business, a business that generated profits of nearly $700 million in the second quarter. Our business is backed by amazing assets including our team, our network of stores and distribution centers, our unique merchandise assortment and a deeper relationship with our guest. Beyond those assets we have a very strong balance sheet and operations that generate a lot of cash providing us the flexibly to undertake the ambitious 3-year transformation we first laid out at our analyst meeting in February. And we continue to look for ways to move faster.", "In February, we announced our plans to complete 250 store transformations in 2018 on top of the 100 plus we are on track to complete this year. However, based on our success so far and the hard work of our real estate and construction teams to grow our capabilities quickly, we now believe we can accomplish more than 300 store remodels next year. While the scope of our transformation is large we remain focused on what has made Target an outstanding retailer over the long-term, all the way back to our first store in 1962. The key for us is embracing the power of ant which makes us unique among our competitive set. When we are at our best our model delivers the best of both mass and specialty retail. We deliver inspiration and convenience and we invite our guest to expect more and pay less. Because we delivered on all of those dimensions over time, we have developed a unique emotional relationship with our guests and we believe that relationship is positioned to thrive in the new era of retail.", "If we continue to offer our guests inspiration and aspiration, differentiate merchandise and experiences and deliver convenience, reliability and great everyday prices we will continue to stand out and succeed in a crowded retail environment. One way to see how the best the Target comes together is a visit one of our exciting new small format stores we have been opening across the country. I visited our new store that recently opened on the USC campus and despite my loyalty as a proud UCLA graduate I couldn\u2019t help being excited by what I saw. The store is already quite busy even though most of the students have yet to return from summer break duty, baby, food and beverage are all selling well. And the store team is quickly evolving their assortment based on feedback from a diverse set of guests, it\u2019s truly inspiring to see the team interact with our new guests and an exciting new shopping environment and I am proud of what they do every day.", "So now I would like to turn the call over to the team who will provide additional detail on our strategic plans and recent performance. First John will provide detail on our work and supply chain and our stores to enhance our fulfillment capabilities and provide a more reliable and inspirational experience for our guests. Then Mark will cover category performance and provide more detail on our recent and upcoming brand launches. Finally, Cathy will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and expectations for the rest of the year.", "So with that I will turn the call over to John for his comments. John?", "John Mulligan", "Thanks Brian. Across all the operations team, we are focused on modernizing Target\u2019s network to create a complete seamless efficient and reliable menu of fulfillment options for our guests. And while we are still in the early stages of a multi-year journey, the team continues to move with unprecedented speed developing skills and processes that allow us to develop, test and iterate much more quickly than we have in the past. Some of our fulfillment capabilities are already well developed and in those cases the team is focused on finding ways to increase our speed, reliability and reach. At the other end of the spectrum, we are in the early stages of testing completely new fulfillment options for our guests. In those situations the work is fully focused on learning from our guests and vendor partners, understanding what is most important to our guests and beginning to evaluate reliable, repeatable processes that will allow Target to fulfill guests rapidly evolving needs and expectations.", "Among our more developed fulfillment capabilities, we have offered in-store pickup of digital orders across all of our locations for years, but we continue to find opportunities to improve execution and we are seeing and continued momentum. Specifically through the first half of the year store pickup volume has grown more than 30% above last year and in July we saw more than 40% growth. As more and more of our guests respond to the convenience of order pickup, we are investing in system enhancements and store labor hours to continue to elevate the guest experience. These investments will be especially important in the fourth quarter holiday season when guests are particularly time pressured and rely on this fulfillment option even more frequently.", "Another way we can enhance the pickup experience is to offer a drive up option, so guests don\u2019t need to leave their cars. And in second quarter we launched the new test of the service, unlike the past when we partnered with third-party to offer this service this new test is being implemented with our own team members and internally developed technology. The offer applies to approximately 180,000 shelf stable items currently eligible for in-store pickup. And in the early stages, we are offering it only to team members in a handful of Twin City stores. However, based on our early results from the test, we expect to move to a guest facing pilot and select Twin Cities locations later in the fall.", "While the capability for our stores to ship digital orders directly to guest homes was also launched 2 years ago, we are seeing even more rapid growth in this fulfillment mode. For the first half of the year ship from store sales are only about twice as high as last year, accounted for more than 40% of digital units shipped. Since the rollout of this capability we have added new ship from store locations every year. In this fall we plan to roll it out to another 350 stores in advance of the holiday season. This will bring the total number of ship from store locations to more than 1,400 stores. In addition, we are creating additional capacity by ramping up the order volume running through our mature ship from store locations. Because so many of our stores can now ship directly to guests, we have been able to increase delivery speed while still controlling costs and that in turn has allowed us to offer new fulfillment options like Target Restock.", "This service allows guest to order a shopping cart size box filled with items chosen from an assortment of more than 15,000 essential items like coffee and paper towels and have it shipped to their house for a fixed $4.99 delivery fee. Because these orders are fulfilled from a nearby store location, we can promise that any restock order placed before 2 PM will arrive at a guest home on the following weekday. You will recall that we rapidly developed this capability the team member test in the first quarter and we moved to the next stage of the test in the second quarter rolling out to Twin Cities Red Card holders in late June. Operationally, this guest facing test has gone well and as a result we just rolled out restock to the Dallas and Denver markets and we plan to expand into another seven markets before the holidays. With restock available in these 10 markets we will already be reaching one quarter of the U.S. market less than six months from the day we launched the test.", "Beyond geographic expansion, we began offering restock to non-Red Card holders in all three test markets. We will be extending the delivery window by adding Saturday delivery and will move the cut off for next day delivery later beyond the current 2 PM cutoff. And given the strong store execution we have seen so far, we will begin ramping up communication and marketing efforts in restock markets which will increase awareness in order volume providing visibility into the capacity of our store team to reliably process higher order volumes. Beyond our internal fulfillment capabilities, our team is also working with transportation partners to improve the speed and cost efficiency of last mile delivery.", "To supplement these efforts, this week we announced our decision to acquire Grand Junction, a San Francisco based transportation technology company. Grand Junction has developed proprietary technology tools and has relationships with more than 700 carriers, allowing retailers to choose the most efficient option for last mile delivery on an individual order. While this acquisition is not expected to have a material direct impact on our financial results, we are excited to bring Grand Junction into the Target team and believe their model will help accelerate our progress in delivering speed, efficiency and a high level of service to Target\u2019s last mile fulfillment. We worked with the Grand Junction team on the test of same day delivery in our Tribeca store which we launched in the second quarter. In this test, guests who check out can choose to have their purchased items delivered to their home on the same day in a delivery window of their choice.", "We have been pleased with the results of the test and have gained some useful insights from the guest response to the offer. For example, the value of the average basket for these same day delivery orders is more than 6x the store average at the Tribeca store and contains nearly 4x the units compared with the stores typical basket. Also notable home is the most common category in same day delivery transactions, ahead of essentials and food and beverage. And importantly net promoter scores for the same day delivery service have been higher than for the Tribeca store overall demonstrating the quality of execution so far. Based on these encouraging initial results, we plan to expand the same day delivery test to several other New York City locations in the fall.", "Of course the most common mode of shopping is still overwhelmingly in our stores. So while we are investing in new ways to leverage our stores for digital fulfillment, we are also investing to bring our great store shopping experience to guests across the country. This includes our remodel program in which we plan to transform the look and feel of more than 600 stores over a 3-year period. In support of this plan, we are on track to deliver more than 100 remodels in 2017. In the second quarter we completed 42 remodels, bringing us to a total of 63 so far this year. And while we are obviously seeing a range of outcomes on an individual store level, we are continuing to see average sales lists in line with our plan to deliver a 2% to 4% sales lift in remodel stores. And as Brian highlighted, the team is doing a great job of scaling up our capacity, which will enable a faster pace of remodels in 2018 than we previously expected. Beyond remodels, our team is delivering our plan to rollout more than 100 small format stores to dense urban, suburban and college campus environments over a 3-year period. For 2017, we are still on track to deliver our plan to add nearly 30 new small format stores. In July, we opened 9 new small stores across the country on top of the 4 we opened in the first quarter. While we have only been open a few weeks, our July openers have been particularly strong out of the gate.", "And as Brian highlighted, the guest response had been phenomenal. For the 7 small format stores, they have been open for more than a year, we are continuing to see sales productivity more than double the company average and these stores have been delivering high single-digit comp increases so far in 2017. So, clearly, our team has been busy transforming our assets and developing new and more efficient ways to fulfill guest demand. But as Brian mentioned, we also need to focus on execution everyday. Even though strong execution may not always grab the headlines, it has a real impact on our performance. An outstanding example is our work to improve the fundamentals of our digital business, which has dramatically reduced the number of guest center contacts related to digital transactions.", "Specifically in 2017, guest contacts per digital order are running 30% lower than last year. This dramatic reduction is the result of concerted effort by our team who looked end-to-end at the digital guest experience, all the way from our site and our apps to ordering, purchasing and fulfillment. Based on this foundational work, the team has worked methodically to reduce friction and pain points and you are seeing the benefit both in our contact statistics and in our digital traffic and sales.", "Another example is our partnership with CVS. As we outlined last year, the conversion of pharmacies created some inevitable friction for our guests driving an initial decline in script count in our stores. Since the conversions began, we have been working closely with the CVS team to minimize the guest impact and build awareness of the benefits CVS can provide. As a result of our joint efforts, guest experience scores in our pharmacies have been climbing since the CVS conversion and are now running well ahead of our pre-conversion levels and we have been seeing the impact in our business.", "In the second quarter, comparable pharmacy script counts turned positive for the first time in more than a year. While this is encouraging, we know we have more opportunities to build on this momentum and we are working with CVS on marketing and guest engagement plans for the fall season. Execution in our stores has been a big focus this year and we are investing in hours training and technology to our large store team members to elevate the shop experience. Depending on the stores volume and buying patterns, we are adding hours to enhance the order pickup experience. In our visual merchandising teams in apparel and home, in beauty and in food and beverage and given all the brand launches that Mark\u2019s team is planning for the fall, we have invested in training and materials to help our store team is best present and sell these new lines to our guests. Across all of our stores, we are asking the team to increase their engagement with guests and ensured they are finding all the items on their list. To support this effort, we are rolling out a new tool that will help our store teams locate items, colors and sizes not available in their store and allow them to sell those items directly to guests right on the sales floor. We are in the very early stages of rolling out this new capability and guest awareness is still low, but we are already getting some initial insights. Not surprisingly over half the activity on these devices has been related to apparel where the ability to find additional sizes and colors creates particular value for our guests.", "So now before I close I want to give a nod to the team. I am incredibly proud of what they have already accomplished and I am energized by their passion to transform our operations in our business on behalf of our guests. And while I know I keep saying that we are just getting started it\u2019s also amazing to look back and realize how much we have already accomplished.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Mark who will provide more detail on our performance and plans and merchandising. Mark?", "Mark Tritton", "Thanks, John. As you have been hearing from many of the industry peers, this continues to be a challenging competitive and consumer environment. That\u2019s why we are particularly pleased by the ongoing progress we saw in the second quarter when we gained further momentum in the areas that we are already performing well and so improvement in the areas where performance needed more focus and our aggressive has come from both stores and digital channels, wherever our guests wants to shop us. From market share perspective, we saw broad-based market share gains across all ad discretionary categories. In hardlines, comparable sales grew between 3% and 4% in the second quarter, the strongest performance we have seen in 10 years. Growth in this area was broad-based including double-digit growth in both videogames driven by Nintendo switch and Apple within electronics. Toys grew more than 3% with board games continuing to be a strong highlight. This is an area where we already enjoy a leading market share position, but continue to grow and take further share due to our focus on innovation and differentiation within our assortment.", "Our apparel and home categories both grew sales and market share in these tough markets. In apparel, growth was widespread across subcategories as guests responded to fashion and newness all underpinned by value through great price right daily items. We were particularly pleased with the ongoing positive performance in kids, which continues to benefit from last year\u2019s launch of Cat & Jack and is now achieving strong year-on-year sales growth and in our strong swim business. Like a performance in board games, we came to the year with the number one market share in swim and have extended that lead to become the clear destination for swim in the U.S.", "In home, digital was an important growth driver and we saw particularly strong performance from our threshold brand. We are also very pleased with the performance of our seasonal businesses from greeting cards to outdoor furniture. Within the seasonal event moments, our 4th of July holiday was strong as we quickly leverage guest and business insights from Memorial Day. In essentials, comp sales were up almost 1% benefiting from the launch of our Target Run and Done campaign that began in the first quarter. We are pleased with the response from our guests specifically with awareness and return on ad spend for this campaign, where results are higher than average. The top two messages guests recall from the campaign are that Target is convenient and I can fulfill all of my need to Target, which were our cool campaign goals. Essentials are also seeing the early benefit from our work to improve our value perception. Specifically, when we are price right daily on key audit and essentials, we are seeing increased traffic and unit sales trends.", "As Brian mentioned earlier, comp sales in the food and beverage category have stabilized and were flat in the second quarter. We are seeing improvement based on our work to improve freshness and reliability as well as the work on value perception. In produce, we saw high single-digit comp increases in the second quarter driven by even stronger growth in organics. And in adult beverage, we saw ongoing double-digit comp growth driven by assortment and display enhancements we have been rolling out across the country. Importantly, we continue to build food and beverage expertise on our team. Following the hiring of Jeff Burt to lead food and beverage in merchandising at the end of the first quarter, we announced that we have hired two new members of his team earlier this week. Looking ahead, Japanese total team, are focused on building on recent momentum. We know we need to enhance our assortment of convenient options for our guests through this ready to eat, ready to heat or ready to cook and save families time and money. In addition, we are focused on enhancing our exclusive brand assortment in food and beverage, while ensuring we are priced-right daily on key opening price point items.", "While overall we have much more to accomplish in the third quarter, our work to improve value perception across all of our assortment is already beginning to have an impact. Specifically, surveys are showing that consumers are noticing Target\u2019s investment in price and value and we saw a much stronger mix of regular price selling in the second quarter as we sort to simplify our promotions, clarify our voice and bring great price right daily items into focus. And it\u2019s working. In fact, our second quarter balance of regular and promotional sales was consistent with levels we haven\u2019t seen since 2012, well before our credit card data breach that changed our promotional cadence and stance.", "Also encouraging was the fact that our unit share in key categories grew more quickly in dollar share, which is a key leading indicator of the impact of this work. At a high level, our second quarter average ticket also reflects the impact of this work. At first glance, reporting a slight decline in average ticket might not sound like good news, but when it\u2019s more than offset by an increase in traffic, the picture is more positive. As we dig into the drivers, the change in basket reflected two key factors. The first was a reduction in general incentive offers, which were replaced with better daily value pricing and more category focused discounts. The second was a meaningful increase in the number of quick trips and fill-in trips we saw from our guests.", "As we mentioned last year, we saw an opportunity to more appropriately balance between stock-up trips and these quicker, smaller trips. So, we are pleased to see our strategy taking hold and generating both trips and conversion. This work on value perception is about ensuring we are price-right daily on key items while delivering more thoughtful and effective promotions throughout our assortments. In many categories, this means we are reducing our everyday pricing and communicating with much more clarity building confidence among our guests. We will expand the scope of this work in the third quarter and we will continue to measure and iterate based on the response.", "Another aspect of our business where we are pleased with our progress is in our inventory position. We reduced out total inventory to last year by more than 4%, while improving the quality of our inventory by bringing unproductive inventory levels down to historical lows. The savings in markdowns through better sell through rates and lower inventory levels has created the capacity for us to invest in what\u2019s new and what\u2019s working which will position us well in the back half of the year. And we do have a lot of newness planned for the rest of the year, perhaps most notable of the new brands that either just launched or will rollout in the next few months.", "In addition to Cloud Island which launched in May and it\u2019s already comping double digits, we launched Isabel Maternity in July. This new brand features the 120 key pieces designed to make every stage of maternity easy, comfortable, stylish and affordable with a focus on fit, function and fashion. And this new brand is already posting strong growth. And as we move into September, we are rolling out two new exclusive apparel brands. In women\u2019s we are launching A New Day, an apparel and accessories brand featuring a strong feminine aesthetic through modern prints and patterns with a focus on building confidence through stylish seasonal and basic items and stories that provide the ultimate wardrobe versatility.", "And in men\u2019s we are launching Goodfellow & Company, which brings the new modern interpretation of classic books, focus on the strong foundation of core items based on insights our guests tell us they want, great quality, fit and fabric, but there is more in-store. In September we will also launch Project 62, a new home brand based on modern design that is thoughtful and approachable. We also built this brand from guest insights to capture their growing demand for modern design with a focus on solving the challenges of urban living including the need for easy mobility based on potential frequent moves. Items incorporate efficiency, simplicity and great design that make urban environments both highly beautiful and functional. Shortly after in October, we are excited to launch Joy Lab, a new women\u2019s athletic fashion apparel brand. Items were designed based on emerging street style that inspires fitness through fashion and building a community based on style and wellness taking you from crunches to brunches. Given the investment in developing this portfolio of new brands, we plan to support these launches with meaningful 360 degree investments in the way only Target can in marketing and digital on social media, in-store experiences with fixturing, mannequins and signage and in training for our store and digital teams.", "It will be hard to miss the amount of newness you will see during the third quarter and we expect our guests will be excited to discover that there is indeed more in the store. Our product design and development, manufacturing, merchandising and marketing teams have been incredibly agile. Having begun their work on these new brands less than 10 months ago, it\u2019s amazing what they been able to accomplish together in this time by keeping truly aligned to our strategic choices. It adds up to a vast body of work and we can\u2019t wait to see all of these new items in our stores and online.", "Our success last year in Pillowfort and Cat & Jack provided the proof of concept and gave us the confidence to begin work on these new brands. Both of those new kids brands were double digit comps in the year following their launch and they are both still growing in the second year while building trips category growth and store basket. And as Brian shared Cat & Jack is now a $2 billion brand based on sales volume in the last 12 months through July of this year, exceeding our initial expectations. Of course we haven\u2019t forgotten the back-to-school and back-to-college key seasons which play a huge role in our third quarter results.", "In back-to-school comps and market share have grown for 10 years straight. And we are focused on extending that record. We continue to invest in digital to support back-to-school including our school list assist site to provide guests a convenient way to access their child supply list and easily order any or all those items to be delivered to their home. More than a million lists are already available on the site, well ahead of last year and sell through the list site have been running 4x higher than a year ago. When students go back to college mom plays a huge role in making everything happen. So we have made sure this year\u2019s marketing speaks to moms as well as students. Hence those campuses that aren\u2019t lucky enough to have one of the use small format stores with pondering with Barnes & Noble College which operates nearly 800 college schools around the country to offer the Target assortment more than 5 million students.", "And finally, given up our success, our team is really excited about the upcoming release in the Star Wars series. To get things started, we are launching our latest Star Wars assortments on September 1, which is being dubbed Force Friday. And to celebrate, we will be opening at midnight in 500 stores across the country. So okay, that\u2019s a lot of newness. I hope you see why we are so excited at Target about all of our strategies and plans coming to life. All of that work supports our long-term vision which is to build on the strengths that have made us such unique retailer for decades.", "As Brian shared, we have build a brand from ends, a brand that offers the best of both mass and specialty. And we have the unique multi-category offering that allows us to drive traffic by leaning into core items and trends. And our brand is known for featuring new exclusive and truly differentiated items comprised own brands like Cat & Jack and national brands like Apple and Casper, because we are so unique, how to put in a box and we like that. We are at our best when we connect with our DNA, unleash the potential of our brand promise to expect more and to pay less, leverage our team and let Target be [indiscernible].", "With that I will turn it over to Kathy who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?", "Cathy Smith", "Thanks Mark. In the second quarter our traffic sales and financial performance were all better than expected. Notably, the upside to our expectations was broad based across the country, across channels and in all three months of the quarter. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.3% driven by a traffic increase of 2.1%. We are particularly pleased to see this growth in traffic which reflects strong execution by our team and the early benefit of the work we are doing to transform our business. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.23 was flat to last year. GAAP EPS was $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS reflecting some small unfavorable tax items not related to our current operations.", "Both the GAAP and adjusted EPS lines reflect about $0.07 of favorability resulting from the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations. This favorability was included in the adjusted EPS calculation, because it reflects a structural benefit to our tax rate resulting from our operations. The amount recorded in the second quarter reflects the year-to-date benefit of our global operations on our tax rate and we expect to recognize an ongoing benefit in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 in both the third and fourth quarters as well. Our second quarter gross margin rate was down about 40 basis points to last year, driven by increased fulfillment costs and the impact of our efforts to improve pricing and promotions. Merchandise mix had a slightly positive impact on our gross margin rate in the quarter reflecting healthy performance in our signature businesses balanced by broad based strength in hardlines.", "One note, beginning this quarter in our financial reporting we have reclassified depreciation expenses associated with our supply chain moving them into the cost of goods line on our P&L. This elective reclassification which resulted from an internal review of how we classify depreciation expense and discussions with the SEC during one of their routine reviews of our filings is reflected in our second quarter 2017 reporting. And we have reclassified prior year results as well. Obviously, this reclassification has no impact on our sales, EBIT, net earnings or EPS but result in equal and offsetting reductions to both our gross margin rate and depreciation and amortization expense rate.", "To provide greater clarity, this morning we posted a document on our Investor Relations website that shows the impact of this reclassification on our quarterly gross margins and D&A rate over the last 3 years. That document shows that the reclassification impact has been either 30 basis points or 40 basis points reduction in our quarterly gross margin and D&A rate throughout that entire 3 year period. And one final note, with this reclassification we will no longer include EBITDA metrics in our segment table.", "On the SG&A expense line we saw a year-over-year increase of about 50 basis points in the second quarter. This increase was driven by compensation costs reflecting the store labor investments that John highlighted earlier as well as higher bonus expense along with impairments related to anticipated store closures and our work to transform our supply chain. These costs were partially offset by the benefit of continued cost discipline throughout the organization. As I mentioned in one of our calls in 2016 for the last couple of years we have been working to create a culture of thoughtful cost discipline. And I am really pleased to see the ongoing benefit of that effort. I want to pause and thank the team both for their passion to transform our company and for their thoughtful cost management, which is helping to fund our investments in this transformation. At the end of the second quarter, our inventory was more than 4% lower than last year. This is vivid confirmation of the benefit of the work of both the operations and merchandising teams to reduce unproductive inventory and speed up our supply chain. These efforts are driving continued strong in stocks and sales growth on a smaller base of inventory.", "Compounding that benefit, we are also beginning to see the impact of our work with vendors to ensure that Target\u2019s payment terms are in line with industry norms, which drove an increase in our payables in the second quarter. The combined benefit of these two factors was an increase in our inventory leverage of more than 10 percentage points compared to last year. The working capital benefit of this leverage improvement is substantial and will provide additional cash to support our transformation. In fact, we are now forecasting 2017 cash flow from operations will be higher than last year despite the operating income reduction we have planed for the year.", "So now, as always I want to pause and reiterate our capital deployment priorities which have remained consistent for decades. We first invest capital into our business on projects that support our strategic and financial objectives. Second, we support our dividend and look to extend our record of raising the dividend annually since 1971. And finally, we repurchased our shares within the limits of our current single A credit ratings. In the second quarter, we devoted more than $700 million to capital investment, paid dividends in excess of $300 million and repurchased just under $300 million of our shares. For the year, we continued to expect that our CapEx will be in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range. However, with the increase in 2018 remodels Brian mentioned earlier, we now expect next year\u2019s CapEx will be $3 billion or more somewhat higher than our previous expectations. This highlights our continued discipline regarding investment deployment. We will increase investment where we have seen solid returns to accelerate our transformation and long-term growth.", "Our second quarter ROIC performance also highlights the benefit of disciplined capital management. Specifically in the 12 months through the second quarter, we generated a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 13.8%. This is about 10 basis points stronger than we reported in the second quarter a year ago if you exclude the gain from the sale of our pharmacy business. So even on lower operating income we have seen an improvement in ROIC, because we taken working capital out of our business.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to our expectations for the third quarter and full year. As we look ahead, we will continue to move with urgency, but plan prudently. Of course, we are facing a tougher prior year comparison in the third quarter and we continue to expand the scope of our pricing and promotional work, which may create additional headwinds for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter comps will be within the range we established across the first two quarters of the year. For the full year, we expect that our comp will be in a range around plan plus or minus 1%. In the third quarter, we are planning for a declining event of approximately $230 million. More than half of this decline will be driven by D&A as we recognized accelerated depreciation related to the anticipated remodels we are planning for 2018. The remaining EBIT pressure will reflect this year\u2019s operating margin investments to support our transformation. Altogether, we are expecting GAAP and adjusted EPS in the $0.75 to $0.95 range in the third quarter.", "Based on our better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year, we are now raising our full year GAAP EPS expectation to the range of $4.35 to $4.55 representing an increase of about 11% from our prior guidance range. Adjusted EPS is expected to be about $0.01 lower than GAAP EPS. Reflecting the tax matters excluded from adjusted EPS in the first half of the year.", "Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I wanted to step back and look at the underlying strength of our business and how it is enabling our transformation through the first half of the year on sales of just over $32 billion, Target\u2019s operations have generated EBIT of more than $2 billion and nearly $3 billion of cash. We have deployed that cash to fund capital investment of more than $1.2 billion. We returned nearly $1.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we have retired about $600 million of our long-term debt. As I said in our financial community meeting at the beginning of the year, we are so fortunate to have such a strong business and balance sheet, which allow us to invest while many of our peers are pulling back. Not only do we have a plan to create a company that will thrive in this new era in retail, we have the financial strength to get us there.", "So with that I will turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks Cathy. Before we move to questions I want to thank you for your engagement and reiterate our commitment to moving quickly, thoughtfully investing in our long-term growth and strong execution every day. While we expect that the near-term environment will remain choppy, we are confident in our 3-year plan to build an even better Target. And our second quarter progress reinforces that confidence. That concludes our prepared remarks.", "Now John, Mark, Cathy and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Brian Cornell", "Operator, before we start taking questions I just want to make a couple of points. I recognized that our prepared comments today were rather lengthy, but we thought it would be important to give you a sense for the rest of the work taking place at Target today, an update on our progress and I hope we provided clarity around the key areas of focus over the balance of year and as we go into 2018. So with that we would love to open it up for your questions today.", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Matt Fassler", "Thanks so much and the detail of your comments is very much appreciated. I have two brief questions for I think for Cathy, the first relates to the implied fourth quarter guidance which seems quite subdued relative to a tough fourth quarter a year ago despite the fact that I believe you have an extra week in the quarter and correct me on that if I am wrong. And then the follow-up to that is just you mentioned D&A moving higher, so if you could just give us some color on the magnitude of the move you would expect to off the restated D&A numbers? Thank you so much.", "Cathy Smith", "Good morning Matt. With regards to both third quarter, fourth quarter and full year we made our guidance as we said we will continue to move with urgency but plan prudently. And I think that\u2019s what you should expect from us. We are finding \u2013 every time we see results coming from our investments we are choosing to continue to invest to accelerate our transformation. And so that\u2019s how I would think about the backside of full year. With regards to the reclassification we did on the supply chain depreciation expense, we posted a great schedule. John and the team posted today to the IR website gives you three full years by quarter. You can see but bottom line is 30 basis points to 40 basis points a quarter change. And you would see that shift from D&A to gross margins.", "Matt Fassler", "We have that, but just in terms of the \u2013 I think you said you expected D&A to be increasing at a faster rate as you accelerated depreciation associated with upcoming remodels, can you try to contextualize the expected increase, how much the pace of G&A growth will change?", "Cathy Smith", "Yes. So it is what\u2019s related \u2013 it\u2019s related to our increasing store remodels as we accelerate some of the depreciation there. And for the full year, I was just quickly looking here where you will see a little bit of continued pressure coming through. So it will pick up. We will follow-up with some specifics if you need it.", "Matt Fassler", "Perfect. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Chris Horvers", "Thanks. Good morning, you had a very strong electronics quarter that the switch which has been a huge hit double digit comps in that and in Apple iPad sounding like they are bouncing back, so it seems like there was a material contributor to same-store sales, how do you think about the sustainability of this benefit presumably the switch moderates but if you think the Apple benefits on tablet compares and the new phone and what are the categories do you think could come in and pick up for what the switch is provided?", "Brian Cornell", "Mark why don\u2019t you provide some insights into our view on electronics?", "Mark Tritton", "Yes. Thanks Chris. I think firstly just on the Apple comments, they weren\u2019t just driven by tablet, they are driven across the board in categories. And we had really strong showing in Q2 on the iWatch which we worked with Apple on clearly. And we have a lot in our plans for Q3 and Q4 with potential new launches as I have outlined. So we think there is still room for growth and continuing the trend. In terms of Nintendo Switch, we worked really closely with those guys as well to develop not only a product but a marketing campaign that the guests really responded to. And so we have been able to secure inventory and a plan all through the fourth quarter, so feeling positive about sustaining a trend there.", "Brian Cornell", "And Chris I think it\u2019s consistent with our focus on bringing newness to the guest. Not only in electronics but through our assortment, I think Mark and his team have done a terrific job working with our vendors and also building own brands that bring excitement and newness to our guests each and every day.", "Chris Horvers", "Understood. And then on the working capital, CapEx side you are seeing some very nice benefits here on working capital this year, how do you think about this year inventory outlook at the end of the year and the working capital benefit and you raised CapEx a bit next year, do you think that increased CapEx is largely offset by continued ongoing benefits in the working capital area?", "Cathy Smith", "So Chris as we have said, we know that we have got a multi-year journey around the supply chain transmission which will help that working capital continue to come through the business. And we wanted to make sure we will keep making that progress through time, so not going to commit longer term just yet as we \u2013 it\u2019s really going to be associated with the a lot of the supply chain transformation. On the increase in CapEx next year again, we are not giving all of next year guidance, but thought important to signal where we are going with our CapEx.", "Chris Horvers", "Understood, have great back half.", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks Chris.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.", "David Schick", "Hi good morning and thanks for all the details. Really wanted to simplify into one question all these different tests and get at one issue whether it\u2019s the world, the tests of curbside and same day whether it\u2019s the rollout of in-store, all the work you are doing, could you talk about all the new initiatives and is it \u2013 does it have more traction with existing customers, anything you can share existing customers capturing back more of their wallet or is it new customers that are new to Target as you go through these new initiatives?", "Brian Cornell", "David, I would tell you it\u2019s the combination of both. And overall, we are very focused on improving the guest experience whether they are shopping in-store or online, making sure that we deepen the relationship with existing and new guests. And we are very pleased with the traffic increases we saw during the quarter. We are honestly very excited about the work that Mark and his team are doing around bringing new brands to our guests. And we have recognized that to move forward and to continue to execute, we have got to continue to make sure we are providing fulfillment options that our guests are looking for today. So as John talked about during our prepared comments, we are very focused right now on testing and expanding different fulfillment options. We have seen some very positive responses to think like Target Restock and we are going to continue to ensure that we can meet the needs of our guests no matter how they want to shop at Target.", "David Schick", "Thanks. Just as a sort of an add-on to that, one other things over the last decade that some retailers run into with all these attempts to reengage of a lot of which are very exciting is either overdoing it or over complicating it, how are you guarding against at the store level the associates not being overwhelmed by these initiatives and managing through that?", "Brian Cornell", "It is a very important question and I am going to turn it over to John here to build on that. But we are trying to make sure we are very, very focused right now. And we have the guests in mind first that the initiatives that we are bringing forward are guest centered, but importantly that we have the right focus on execution each and every day. And I think what we saw in the second quarter is a byproduct of our focus on execution each and every day in our stores, online, in our supply chain and I think you are starting to see that focus really connect with the guests.", "John Mulligan", "Dave, I think the other thing I would add, you are 100% right about the focus. I think the key challenge there for us is to continue to take work that is not guests facing out of the store and guest facing work there like we study investments we are making in food and beverage and beauty, in visual merchandising, that includes things like order pickup and shipping from the store. But there are opportunities everywhere else to pull work out of the store and I think the stores teams have done a great job optimizing within the box. We need to continue to optimize upstream to help them take work out and that\u2019s a lot of testing we are doing today. I didn\u2019t talk a lot about it, but we have tests going on in multiple parts of the country, focused on taking work out of the store, so they can be focused on the guests.", "David Schick", "Thanks so much.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Robby Ohmes", "Good morning. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian the \u2013 you guys have been mentioning the environment challenges and we are seeing very aggressive promotions out there in categories like apparel, your store traffic improved a lot this quarter, I am just curious are there \u2013 can you give us any color \u2013 are you picking up more share from competitor store closings than you would have thought? And then also as you shift more to EDLP while others are getting maybe more promotional, any insights from what you have seen so far in August that you can share with us on how all this is working out? And sorry just to add on this also and I don\u2019t know whether John Mulligan or Mark want to jump in on this, but as you pulled back up almost more you shift more to EDLP, can you remind us where things like cartwheel fit into that as you move forward and also how you see Red Card penetration playing out in your strategy? Thanks.", "Brian Cornell", "So, Robby, there is 4 or 5 different questions there and we will try to un-bundle each of them. But as Mark talked about during his prepared comments during the second quarter, we saw very strong market share growth across a number of categories. We continue to see share growth in apparel, in home, in hardline and one of the things that I think we felt best about in the quarter and it\u2019s a byproduct of the work we have done from a promo standpoint as we continue to see our business in essentials shift back to regular price sales and the impact of our new marketing and advertising campaign, the Target Run and Done campaign, which has driven really positive reaction from the guests and accelerated our business in essentials. So, that was a real big highlight for us in the second quarter. And we have talked about this before. We are at our best when we balanced both style and household essentials and you are seeing that balance come to play in the second quarter and we certainly are going to continue that over the balance of the year and into 2018. So, it was a period of time where we felt good about the progress we are making as we pickup market share in many of our signature and style categories. We have seen growth in our essential businesses and we will build off of that as we go into the balance of 2017 and \u201818.", "Cathy Smith", "Sorry, Robby, around Cartwheel. So, Cartwheel remains a really viable promotional vehicle and gets engaging the tool for us. And what we are doing though in the simplification of our pricing messaging and creating great price right daily items is we are using Cartwheel, but we are reducing the amount of stock that\u2019s coming in and that\u2019s really helping us to clarify and simplify our message to the guests about what true everyday value is as well as what\u2019s an exceptional promotion. So, the re-scoping of that has been tremendous thus far and we are really \u2013 our regular business is shining and our promotional business risk out in a great way.", "Robby Ohmes", "And any chance we can get you guys to comment on August?", "Brian Cornell", "Obviously, not.", "Robby Ohmes", "Great job, Brian. Thanks so much.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you. Appreciate it, Robby.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Summers with Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Bob Summers", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Brian Cornell", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob Summers", "Just two questions, you have had some recent hires in sort of the food umbrella, I am just curious as to how the new individual fit into the current strategy and whether this is a catalyst for shift and maybe something more into the prepared food sort of side of the equation? And then secondly, if you are willing to comment, I would love to know what the trends look like, the business trends look like in and around Prime Day?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes. Why don\u2019t we turn it over to Mark to talk about both food and what we saw during that Prime period?", "Mark Tritton", "Thanks Bob. I think that we outlined in our Q1 comments around the emergence of our strategy that we are going to be on the journey of implementation as Jeff joined us in the business. And Jeff has already come in and begun start testing and iterating new ideas and concepts on top of our strategies that are creating growth vehicles. So, we are excited about that, the new people entering our business and just creating new strength against the strategic intent. So, firstly, Liz Nordlie will add value to own brand growth potential there and strengthen our efforts there as well as Mark Kenny, really with his expertise in general grocery but specifically in the convenient meal area and in bakery etcetera. I mean, that is part of our ongoing strategic intent to strengthen and focus there. So, these are key investments in our strategy and in our team balancing them against existing talent. In regards to your query around Prime, we were really happy to see ongoing trends maintain during Prime and we had positive comps and a really strong growth in regular price business continuing through those days but on in-store and online.", "Bob Summers", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Bob, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Your line is open.", "Peter Benedict", "Alright, guys. Thanks. And Mark, I just was hoping you could expand maybe a little bit on some of the merchandising assortment changes that you are making in the consumable side of the business to food area, particularly in pet food, what\u2019s going on there and anything to note there from a remodel prospective?", "Mark Tritton", "Yes, thanks Peter. So, let me just start with pet. I mean, we announced this month the addition of Blue Buffalo to our assortment, which is the number one brand in the U.S. and a really core assortment to get. So excited to add that into our mix and we already have a lot of data from our guests is just that they wanted to see that at Target. We also embarked on an agreement with BarkBox. So, really refocusing our accessory and our total assortment of doing business inside pet, so an exciting uptick there, because that brings further guests trips and conversion. Around the food and beverage area in terms of general assortment, we are still working on there and more to follow.", "Peter Benedict", "That\u2019s helpful. And then just leveraging on that, when you think about the private brand introductions, I mean, good color on what\u2019s coming this year, but when we think about next year, is it continue to be in kind of the signature categories or should we expect some private brand introductions to start to emerge on the consumable side of the store? Thank you.", "Mark Tritton", "I think that we have talked openly about a roster of more than 12 brands that we will be bringing to life over a period of time. We have begun that journey. That continues into 2018. It highlights definitely the signature areas, but the strength at providing differentiation exclusivity and therefore preference for Target through these is applicable to many different areas. So, we are looking at all areas and opportunities and we have some plans in place.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Brandon Fletcher", "Hey, guys. Fantastic quarter. Congratulations. The only question I have essentially just on the pick for store concept, I just want to share a comment we had from an industrial engineer that was working for mew a long time ago that it\u2019s about as efficient as a driver who takes three rides to take a left. There is massive cost when you have people walk the store instead of being your customers and walk it back out on a simulated basis. I get incrementally. I get that you don\u2019t have to have the checkout cost and that offsets a little bit. Is there something that\u2019s coming that you guys are confident on the operational side that will make you pick from store the way you guys are doing it better than lots of other folks, so that we don\u2019t face as much of efficiency? And similarly, will the remodels make those operational changes you think less difficult or more efficient in terms of cost structure?", "Brian Cornell", "Yes, hi Brandon. I think anytime you focus on just one slice of the total fulfillment, you lose picture for the whole thing right, we are trying to optimize the total economics for Target and those economics include investments, capital investments we might otherwise have to make if we don\u2019t utilize the existing assets. So, I think we can point to any one slice and say this was going to be better or worse, but again we are optimizing total economic picture and I\u2019d have you think about that. I think the remodels where they will really help us and it\u2019s in conjunction with us taking inventory out of the backroom is our ability to optimize that backroom more efficiently to drive more productivity as we shift from the store. And so that\u2019s the real opportunity as we go through the remodel cycle.", "Brandon Fletcher", "That\u2019s the micro fulfillment in the backrooms would be one of the benefit to remodels?", "Brian Cornell", "For sure. And in conjunction with operating changes to reduce inventory like I was talking about earlier and taking work out of that \u2013 other work out of the store.", "Brandon Fletcher", "It sounds great. Thank you.", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.", "Michael Lasser", "Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you quantify how much of the $1 billion of operating profit investment you plan to make has already been deployed thus far this year?", "Cathy Smith", "Good morning, Michael. As you saw in the quarter, we are seeing the continued investment in both the SG&A as well as gross margin. We also though are working really hard to make sure that we can offset with efficiencies throughout the organization where appropriate. And so you are seeing that you saw it come through in SG&A and in gross margin this second quarter, you saw it in the first quarter as well. We continue to do that. So, where we see the investments give the return that we expect and the results we expect we are investing faster and heavier to accelerate the transformation. So, I would say we are on path to what we said we would do and you are seeing it come through in both Q1 and Q2.", "Brian Cornell", "Operator, we have got time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your final question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.", "Kate McShane", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just ask about promotions a little bit more if you don\u2019t mind. I know management promotions are fluid, but how much more work do you need to do in moving your categories in products to EDLP and what \u2013 where are these changes impacting the second half outlook and I know you have mentioned that there has been challenges in the past in terms of conveying value to your guests and I just wondered how this messaging has changed?", "Mark Tritton", "Yes. Hi Kate, I will take that one. So our promotional efforts are really rolled through the quarter even. And we began them in first quarter in April and a second round of taking key items that comprise our guest basket and focusing on priced right daily items really took hold and then second wave in \u2013 by the end of July. The next round of that is through October and that\u2019s when we will be coming together to have a more concise in-store marketing campaign and regular cadence of new ways [ph] to the guest to communicate value. So we think at that point that we have a strong base to maintain and this is why in half two we have been prudent in how we forecasted our sales and margin based on also unit growth initially. We see trip growth initially and we need to see that dollar growth balanced out over time. But we know that we have been patient with that, hence some of that earlier discussions at the start of the year about investing ahead of.", "Brian Cornell", "I think promotions along with many of the other things we talked about are still obviously in the early stages. We are excited about the results that we have seen with remodels, but we have hundreds of stores in front of us. We have seen great response to some of our small format but again we will open up dozens of additional stores over the next couple of years. The brands that we have launched have been well received, but we are really just getting into in the heart of the brand launches as we go in the back half of \u201817 and \u201818 as well as the pricing and promo work. So we are very pleased with the progress. We know we have got much more work in front us, but we thought today would be a great chance to give you a progress report and give you a sense for the amount of work and the scope of work that\u2019s taking place within Target. So that concludes our second quarter 2017 earnings call. I really appreciate all of you participating. So thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

LLC", "Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 15, 2017.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Hulbert - Target Corp.", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.", "On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.", "In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on Target's third quarter performance and our plans and priorities going forward. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.", "As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release which is posted on our Investor Relations website.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our third quarter performance and our priorities going forward. Brian?", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with Target's third quarter performance, which reflected a continuation of the positive trends that emerged in the second quarter. We saw continued growth in both our comparable traffic and comparable sales in the face of more difficult prior-year comparisons on both measures.", "Digital sales grew 24% on top of 26% a year ago. And we announced new innovative partnerships with both Google and Pinterest that will continue to expand the digital reach of our brand. We saw a meaningful increase in the percent of our sales at regular price, reflecting the benefit of our work to communicate value more clearly and provide our guests confidence that Target assortment is priced right daily.", "We rolled out four new owned brands across our home and apparel categories, all of which are off to a great start. And we generated an unprecedented amount of buzz when we announced an amazing new designer partnership with Chip and Joanna Gaines called Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, which launched last week.", "We also remodeled 37 stores in the quarter in support of our plan to transform 110 stores this year, and we opened 12 new stores in a single week in October. These stores are located in a diverse array of neighborhoods across the country, ranging from our new Herald Square location in New York City, all the way to our newest location in Honolulu. Beyond the direct financial returns we are seeing on these investments, our guests continue to confirm for us both through their feedback and their shopping decisions that our efforts are paying off.", "And finally, this quarter, we made some meaningful announcements regarding our team. In early September, we announced our intent to hire an additional 100,000 team members for the peak holiday season, up from 70,000 a year ago. And later that month, we announced we would increase our minimum wage nationally to $11 an hour in October in support of a commitment to raise our national minimum to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. These investments reflect the value of our team and our commitment to supporting them, as they provide outstanding service to our guests every day.", "The strength of our team is never more evident than in times of need. And unfortunately, we faced several natural disasters in the quarter, from hurricanes in Texas and Florida, to wildfires in California. In the face of these challenges, there are countless stories of our team coming together to support each other and their communities, in the face of heartbreaking devastation. While our team was focused on ensuring the safety of their own families, they also worked tirelessly to reopen stores quickly and move needed essentials from other parts of the country in support of our guests, as they returned home and began the long process of rebuilding their homes. So, I want to thank our team, not just for the hard work every day, but their dedication to our guests and communities in times of need.", "It was only last February that we walked you through a detailed plan to accelerate investments in our business that will best position Target for continued success in a rapidly changing environment. Our plan included the investment of more than $7 billion of capital over three years to accelerate our progress in support of several key initiatives, including: blending Target's digital and physical shopping experiences; reimagining our existing stores and the labor model to operate them; rolling out new fulfillment options to enhance convenience for our guests; opening new small-format stores in dense urban, suburban and college campus neighborhoods; and reinventing our assortment of exclusive brands to further differentiate Target from everyone else in retail.", "On top of this capital commitment, we outlined an investment of $1 billion of operating margin this year. This commitment has allowed us to move fast, invest in our team and reset our value positioning in the marketplace. With three quarters of the year behind us, I am pleased that we are either on track or ahead in delivering all of our goals for the year. And supported by strong execution by our team, our financial results this year have been meaningfully ahead of our expectations.", "A key factor in delivering our goals is the ability of our team to move faster than ever before, and nowhere is that speed more evident than our supply chain, where we are rapidly testing and rolling out new fulfillment options for our guests. Already this year, we've taken Target Restock from only a concept to being fully operational in 11 key markets throughout the country, and we continue to expand the list of eligible items while extending the order deadline for next-day delivery.", "We've tested and rolled out same-day delivery in four locations in New York City, supported by our recent acquisition of Grand Junction. And we have rapidly tested and rolled out a new Drive Up service in 50 locations in the Twin Cities where we're receiving positive feedback from our guests. With each of these capabilities, the team is rapidly learning and iterating as we expand our reach, and we have plans to further build out all of these fulfillment options in 2018.", "We've taken the same approach to our ship-from-store capabilities, which we first rolled out to approximately 140 stores only a few years ago. As we enter the holiday season this year, the count of ship-from-store locations has grown more than tenfold and it's now in more than 1,400 locations across the country.", "You'll note that for each of these fulfillment options, our stores play the key role in delivering the experience. This is only one example of the ways that we've been asking more from our team members than ever before, and that's why this year's investment in our team has been so important. We've invested in additional hours to support new services while continuing to be available to assist our guests.", "We've invested in the rollout of a new operating model with more specialized roles that support stronger execution and deliver more product expertise on the sales floor. We've invested in training to elevate the guest experience, moving away from task-driven models to a guest-focused mind-set. And we've invested in wages to ensure we can attract and retain the right team members who consistently deliver a differentiated Target experience every day.", "So as we move into the busiest time of the year, I feel confident that our stores are better prepared than ever before. And in more than 100 of our stores, guests will be enjoying a newly-transformed environment this holiday season, courtesy of this year's remodel program. Also, in nearly 30 local neighborhoods across the country, guests will be able to enjoy their holiday shopping at a nearby Target store for the first time.", "Across every store and on Target.com, guests this holiday season will be able to shop eight new exclusive brands that we launched in 2017 in addition to our outstanding lineup of new and innovative items from our national brand partners. And, of course, throughout the holiday season, we'll deliver unique and inspiring marketing intended to highlight the joy of being together during the holidays.", "It's important to remember the role that this year's investments have played in getting us to where we are today. We started this year with a very healthy business, one that generates lots of cash. We made a decision to ramp up the investments of that cash in both capital and operating margin to speed up our progress. Today, we have a very healthy business that generates lots of cash, a business that has seen two consecutive quarters of healthy traffic growth giving us increased confidence as we enter the holiday season.", "While the fourth quarter is always intensely competitive, we are entering this holiday season with lots of confidence. Enabled by this year's investments and the tireless efforts of our team, we have an outstanding set of plans this year. And while it's still very early, we've been encouraged with the guest response to the launch of Hearth and Hand, as well as last week's release of the Target exclusive version of Taylor Swift's new album, Reputation. While the bulk of the season is still ahead of us, we are very happy to see how these early efforts have set the tone for the season, as we are already showing our guests that Target will offer unique holiday merchandise and experiences that you can't find anywhere else.", "With that, I will turn the call over to John for his comments. John?", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, a key priority of our work and operations is based on the goal to provide new and reliable fulfillment options for our guests. As of today, we have multiple new fulfillment options that are in some phase of testing or rollout across our network. We offer in-store pickup of digital orders, available in all of our store locations. We have a Drive Up service which we just began testing at 50 locations in the Twin Cities. We now have same-day delivery which we're testing at four stores in New York City. We offer next-day delivery through Target Restock, which is now available for 90 million guests in 11 markets. And we have a ship-from-store capability which is now in more than 1,400 of our locations.", "Of those five fulfillment options, only two were available as we entered the year, in-store pickup and ship-from-store. And while both of those options are relatively mature, we continue to increase the amount of our digital volume handled by our stores. Today, the stores are already fulfilling more than half of our total digital volume through the pickup and ship-from-store capabilities, and that will peak at well above 80% in the days leading up to Christmas. In fact, our stores are planning to ship over 30 million units related to digital orders in the peak four weeks of the holiday season, up from about 18 million units last year.", "Among the new fulfillment capabilities we've launched this year, Target Restock has been ramping up quickly. During the third quarter, we rolled out this service to an additional 10 markets across the country. We also extended the deadline for next-day delivery to 7 PM and expanded the number of eligible items to more than 15,000. The average value of a Restock order is about 50% larger than an average store transaction and we're pleased that our stores have been able to fill these orders reliably and efficiently.", "Another capability we've just begun rolling out this year is same-day delivery, which we are now offering at four stores in the New York City market. For a small fee, typically between $5 and $10 depending on the address, guests can leave their basket with us at check out and arrange for delivery later the same day in a time window of their choosing. Guests in these stores are enthusiastically responding to this service. Basket sizes for delivery transactions are running six to nine times the average transaction across the four stores that have the service. And our home category continues to account for more than half of the total sales on these delivery orders.", "And finally, our new Drive Up capability is in the earliest stage of testing. We rolled out this service to 50 stores in the Twin Cities in the third quarter and we're pleased with the early results. Specifically, guest survey scores for this service are running well ahead of goal, and the stores are outperforming our goal for average wait time. Last week, we began offering this service at our next-generation store in Houston.", "As we look ahead to next year, we'll continue scaling all of our new fulfillment capabilities, including same-day and next-day delivery. Our ultimate goal is to build a supply chain that can reliably deliver any item in our network to all but the most remote areas in the U.S. in two days or less, with most items delivered in one day. While a large percentage of our digital orders today are already arriving that quickly, we have more work to do before we can reliably deliver in that timeframe across all of our assortment.", "To achieve this goal and to be able to scale all these new fulfillment capabilities, we need to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of our entire supply chain, from end to end. While we have already made progress on all of these measures, we still have a lot more to do and our new flow center in Perth Amboy, New Jersey will help us get there. We added this building to our network, not because we needed the capacity, but because it will allow our team to learn in a separate facility without the distraction of operating in tandem with the rest of our operations. It's managed by a very lean team that operates like a startup, rapidly building solutions from scratch and iterating as they learn. They run their operations with all new systems and processes developed in-house, including their inventory planning system, order management system, warehouse management system and transportation.", "This facility is now serving five of our new small format stores in New York City, which allows them to test these new systems under the most extreme conditions. Specifically, these stores generate very high sales per square foot and have little to nonexistent backroom storage space. As a result, they require rapid replenishment. In fact, our new Herald Square and Tribeca locations are receiving multiple shipments a day from this facility.", "When these stores receive merchandise, they don't have the room or the time to unpack and store anything more than they need. To address this constraint, the Perth Amboy facility packs custom shipments for each store which are delivered in bins organized by aisle of the store. As a result, these stores can rapidly move deliveries right on to the sales floors and quickly replenish shelves from the pre-sorted bins. This minimizes the amount of store labor devoted to replenishment allowing the team to devote more of their time to serving their guests. Once the new process reaches a higher level of maturity, we'll be able to scale up within the facility, incorporate automation into the process and begin replicating this model elsewhere in the network.", "So now, while I hope it's clear that fulfillment and speed are huge areas of focus for the operations team, I want to be clear that's not our only priority. We are also investing to reach guests in new neighborhoods and elevate the experience in all of our stores. To reach new densely populated neighborhoods, we've completely changed our approach to choosing the location for our small format stores. In the past, we had a relatively rigid prototype for a store's size and layout, and our real estate team focused on finding sites that would accommodate that prototype. Today, when we find space available in an attractive neighborhood, we custom design a store that can fit the available space. These stores generate high sales productivity and higher-than-average gross margin rates, driving strong returns on investment. And for the smaller group of these stores that have now been operating for more than a year, we continue to see very healthy growth in both traffic and comparable sales.", "Beyond new stores, our team is quickly scaling up their ability to remodel existing locations, as we're rapidly growing the program from fewer than 30 stores in 2016 to more than 325 next year. Like our new small stores, we apply a custom approach to our remodel projects based on condition of each store and characteristics of the neighborhood. In all cases, when we remodel a store, we focus on convenience, including the incorporation of self-checkout and a separate area for store pickup. And we upgrade the shopping experience for our guests, incorporating more across merchandising opportunities. We carefully measure the financial performance of our remodeled stores, and we continue to see an average sales acceleration of 2% to 4%, right in line with our goals for the program.", "But beyond our investments in the physical shopping environment, we're investing in our team and our stores. We're investing in more hours in training to elevate the level of service our teams can provide. We're also changing our operating model, creating specialized teams responsible for specific categories so they can become category experts who can better assist our guests.", "And finally, we're investing in wages so we can continue to recruit and retain an outstanding team, a team that will continue to differentiate Target from our competitors. The strength of our team was evident as we rolled out four new brands in our stores in the third quarter. Our team presented these new brands better than we ever have before playing a key role in their early success. This has been an amazing year of change for our operations team. We're moving faster and thinking bigger than we ever have before, as we create and implement plans to modernize nearly everything we do.", "So while I want to stress that our future focus isn't slowing down, I also want to make it clear that everyone across our team is laser focused on serving our guests during the holiday season. I want to thank the team for all their efforts to prepare for the season and for all their upcoming hard work during our busiest time of the year. Our team is the reason Target is a special brand and a great place to work.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark who will provide more detail on our third quarter performance and our holiday plans and merchandising. Mark?", "Mark J. Tritton - Target Corp.", "Thanks, John. Going into this year, two of our highest strategic priorities in merchandising were: first, to invest in our exclusive own brand portfolio to further reinforce our differentiated positioning in the market; and second, strengthening Target's value proposition and positioning making sure we're priced right daily every day which would reinforce with thoughtful, meaningful promotions that resonate with our guests and support our brand.", "As Brian highlighted earlier, we're encouraged by our progress on both priorities. In the third quarter alone, we launched four more new and exclusive own brands across apparel and accessories and in home which we then followed at the start of the fourth quarter with the blockbuster launch of Hearth and Hand with Magnolia. With this portfolio that we've rolled out this year, we are presenting our guests with new ideas and items across eight new and exclusive own brands in readiness for the holiday season to create a unique differentiated offer that builds preference for our guests to choose Target.", "Beyond the immediate strong sales growth that we've seen from these new brands, consumer survey show they are contributing to the Target brand overall. Specifically, consumer scores for Target differentiation have recently risen to a 10-year high, which will provide a benefit to traffic and sales in all of our categories over time, much like we saw when we launched Cat & Jack.", "To reinforce our value proposition with guests this year, our team has also moved at a rapid pace and the response from our guests has exceeded our expectations. Specifically, we've seen a multibillion-dollar increase in sales at regular price so far this year, more than offsetting the decline in sales on discount. This clearly demonstrates that guests are increasingly confident that Target is priced right daily and are not only relying on promotions to get a great deal.", "Supported by our Run and Done marketing campaign, confidence in our pricing has driven a rapid increase in quick and fill-in trips which you can see by that traffic and basket trends. As we look back at our third quarter results from a category and market share perspective, we are driving strong relative performance in our discretionary categories. And while we're seeing steady improvement in frequency categories, these areas are facing some near-term headwinds from this year's investment to be priced right every day. As a result of this effort, which was completed late in the third quarter, we're seeing stronger unit share improvements in many frequency categories compared with dollar share. This is an important positive leading indicator for future dollar gains in these categories which is only reinforced by our positive traffic trends.", "Across our five broad merchandising categories, hardlines led the way in the third quarter with a strong single-digit comp increase. This growth was driven by continued double-digit comp growth in electronics benefiting from newness, particularly in the video game and mobile segments.", "Our home category also saw a healthy comp increase in the third quarter led by the successful launch of our new exclusive Project 62 own brand along with the continued benefit from the consumer trend of spending on their homes.", "In apparel and accessories, we gained strong share for the quarter in a space which consumer spending in the overall market is currently declining. Despite lean inventories in the first half of the quarter as we got ready to replace brands and unusually warm weather across most of the country during the bulk of the quarter, our overall comp was down only slightly. But following the launch of each of our three new exclusive apparel and accessory own brands mid-quarter, A New Day in women's, Goodfellow & Co in men's and Joy Lab in activewear, we generated strong sales and traffic results, and we saw even more market improvement when colder weather finally arrived near the end of the quarter.", "Third quarter comp sales in food and beverage were up slightly despite a continued headwind from deflation in several categories, combined with adjustments from our own work on pricing. We continue to measure steady progress in food and beverage and most encouragingly, we're seeing the strongest results where we've been investing. This is best evidenced in produce where we've been investing in freshness, organics, in-stocks and specialized store labor where we saw a high-single digit comp increase in the quarter. Adult beverage also continued its strength where we saw continued double-digit comp growth, reflecting our work on assortment and in-store presentation across the country.", "And lastly, in essentials, we saw a slight comp decline in the third quarter. Now, this area more than any other area has seen the most change from our work on price and value. And as I mentioned upfront, because we're seeing much stronger unit share and trip growth in this category, we are very confident that this year's work will set us up for stronger performance over time.", "One further highlight was in beauty, which has continued to gain market share. This category is benefiting from our investments to differentiate both the assortment and the store service model, as we focus on emerging trends and first-to-market brand launches, supported by an increasing number of dedicated beauty experts in our store who are available from open to close, all delivered at an unbelievable value.", "Before I look ahead to the holidays, our third quarter review wouldn't be complete without a recap of our key seasons. In back-to-school, we added to our long record of logging comp growth year after year, and we saw the strongest result in kids apparel and supplies. In back-to-college, we benefited from positive results in electronics, reflecting all of the newness I mentioned earlier. In Halloween, we saw our strongest share results in the early part of the season as the final late-season positive sales surge moved further into the fourth quarter based on the timing of the holiday relative to our fiscal calendar.", "As we look ahead to this year's holiday season, we have made significant strategic changes to the quality and level of our inventory position. Our teams have reduced unproductive inventory which has created room across our network for all the newness we are now delivering. As we ended the third quarter, we planned for our inventory position to be higher than a year ago, reflecting specific early intentional investments to support the launches of new items in electronics along with inventory to support Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, which launched at the beginning of the fourth quarter.", "Speaking of Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, we're really pleased with the initial results from the launch, which has set the perfect tone for the holidays. The collection, which was co-created with our friends, Chip and Joanna Gaines, features more than 300 items in tabletop, home d\u00e9cor and giftables, most for under $30. On the day the collaboration debuted, guests were shopping online in the early hours and lining up outside our stores across the country. And based on early demand, we're implementing our inventory contingency plans to quickly replenish items that are already selling through.", "Also new for the holidays this year, we've made a meaningful investment in our gifting program, which features more than 1,700 items curated for women, men, kids and teens. Most of the items are exclusive to Target and priced under $15, and they'll be displayed prominently in both our stores and online to make it even more easy and convenient for our guests to find the right gift this season.", "And, of course, we'll be offering great deals on a huge assortment of new and innovative items across our entertainment, electronics and toy categories. In toys, we've added more than 1,400 new and exclusive items this year from sought-after national specialty and owned brands. This season, we'll also be featuring more than 70 exclusive board games, building on the continued strength in this category that we've seen all year.", "In electronics, we'll be featuring new and in-demand consoles across software including the Nintendo Switch and Super Mario Odyssey game, along with a Target-exclusive Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle. This season will also feature a focus on a much broader assortment of voice-activated speakers, like Google Home, with an expanded assortment of wearable technology and accessories, and as always, we'll offer a full line of Apple products highlighting all of the recent launches.", "In entertainment, we'll continue to highlight Taylor Swift's new album, Reputation, which features two exclusive collectible magazines available only at Target. This album broke the record for the number of preorders in advance of its launch last week, and we've continued to see strong demand in sales since the debut.", "Throughout the holiday season, we'll continue to offer outstanding value to our guests with meaningful deals on the items that they want the most. New this year, we've introduced Weekend Deals, which features marquee prices on new items every weekend based on what we know guests are looking for at different times throughout the season.", "In addition, we'll continue to offer our regular cadence for our weekly ad and Cartwheel offers and we'll offer some of our lowest prices of the year during big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. All of these deals are designed to reinforce the work we've done all year to show guests that we are priced right daily, and we'll continue to highlight our new lower prices with signage in our stores and online.", "So I hope it's clear that we feel really well-positioned as we enter our peak season. Everything we've planned for this year will reinforce for our guests why they love Target during the holidays. By offering unprecedented newness, convenience and meaningful deals, all wrapped up with uniquely Target marketing campaigns that remind guests of the universal joy that comes from togetherness in the season.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy who will provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?", "Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.", "Thanks, Mark. Consistent with the second quarter, our third quarter traffic, comparable sales and overall financial performance were all stronger than our expectations. Third-quarter comparable sales increased 0.9%, driven by a traffic increase of 1.4%, both of these numbers decelerated sequentially as we faced a tougher prior-year comparison. However, on a two-year stacked basis, both traffic and comp sales accelerated in the third quarter.", "Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.91 was near the upper end of our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.87, $0.04 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by the net effect of two offsetting factors. The primary impact was a $123 million pre-tax charge related to our October debt repurchase which lowered GAAP EPS from continuing operations by $0.14. This was largely offset by a $0.10 positive impact related to income tax matters. The majority of this $0.10 benefit was driven by a decrease in our 2016 net taxes related to our global sourcing operations. The remaining benefit was related to the favorable resolution of other income tax matters in the quarter.", "One other note on our third quarter tax expense, in addition to the matters we've excluded from adjusted EPS, third quarter adjusted and GAAP EPS from continuing operations reflect a $0.03 benefit from our global sourcing operations related to our 2017 taxes.", "Our third quarter gross margin rate of 29.7% was down about 10 basis points from last year. This decline reflects continued pressure from digital fulfillment and our work on pricing and promotions, mostly offset by our cost control efforts. Merchandise mix had a roughly neutral impact on our third quarter gross margin rates, as healthy performance in higher margin categories was balanced by strength in hardlines.", "Our third quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.1% was about 80 basis points higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by compensation expense, reflecting a year-over-year increase in team member incentives combined with the impact of investments in store hours and wage rates. This was partially offset by the timing of some expenses and our cost-saving efforts.", "The third quarter depreciation and amortization line was about $70 million higher than last year. This increase reflects the impact of accelerated depreciation related to next year's remodel program, which will transform about three times as many stores compared with this year. We recently finalized our specific store remodel plans for next year and subsequently refined our D&A forecast by quarter. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we expect a similar or somewhat smaller year-over-year increase in the D&A expense line than we just experienced in the third quarter. And as we look ahead to 2018, our current view is that quarterly D&A will be about $80 million higher than 2017 in each of the first three quarters next year, reflecting the continued recognition of accelerated depreciation on next year's much larger group of remodels.", "At the end of the third quarter, our inventory was a little more than 5% higher than last year. This represents a change from the trend we've seen in recent quarters in which our inventory has declined even as we've maintained a strong in-stock position. This quarter's increase reflects a year-over-year change in the timing of our holiday season inventory. One area that has increased is electronics in which the team has made early intentional investments in new and innovative items in the video game and mobile categories.", "We expect our inventory will be roughly flat to last year by the end of the fourth quarter. Over the longer term, we continue to believe we have a meaningful opportunity to increase inventory turnover as we work to speed up our supply chain. And in the near term, we believe recent favorability and payables leverage will continue into next year, providing a benefit to working capital and cash flow from operations.", "Our business continues to return a lot of cash. Specifically, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations in the third quarter. In keeping with our goals and guidance for the year, we devoted more than $800 million of capital investment to our business this quarter bringing our year-to-date totals to just over $2 billion. In addition, we returned $339 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and another $171 million through share repurchase.", "Regarding the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, we invested $463 million to repurchase high coupon debt in the quarter, which was offset by the issuance of $750 million of 30-year debt at very favorable rates. In January, we have $1.1 billion in debt maturing which we expect to retire with cash.", "Now let's look ahead to our expectations for fourth quarter and full year financial performance. As I have mentioned all year, we continue to plan prudently while developing the agility to adjust to changing conditions and market opportunities. And while I hope we've shown today that we have outstanding plans going into the holiday season, we enter every holiday season knowing that it will be highly competitive and promotional.", "Putting all of those considerations together, we believe that Target is positioned to deliver comparable sales of flat or better in the fourth quarter with an upside potential for a 2% comp increase. We expect to see continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting the cost of digital fulfillment combined with the impact of our work to ensure we are priced right daily for our guests.", "Our SG&A outlook reflects thoughtful investments in our team and in our stores to support outstanding service for our guests during the peak holiday season. Combined with the pressure on D&A I outlined earlier, we expect EBIT will be about $290 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. This performance translates to an expectation for both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.25 in the fourth quarter.", "Adding this expectation to our actual performance through the first three quarters, you will see that our expected range for full year adjusted EPS is now $4.40 to $4.60. This is $0.06 higher than our guidance three months ago and $0.50 higher than our expectation going into the year. Regarding full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations, we expect a range of $4.38 to $4.58, $0.02 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by the net impact of debt retirement cost and tax benefits we recognize throughout the year.", "One other note, both our fourth quarter and full year expectations include the recognition of a 53rd accounting week this year, consistent with many other retailers. As we said before, this week is somewhat smaller than an average week in the year, at about $1 billion in sales. From an operating margin standpoint, for that week, we expect to see gross margin and SG&A rates relatively similar to our annual averages. In addition, we will benefit from leverage on D&A that week as that expense is recognized on an annual basis.", "And one final note, given that the holiday season plays such an important role in our fourth quarter performance, we announced today that we plan to issue a post-holiday season financial update on Tuesday, January 9.", "As Brian mentioned earlier, the underlying health of our business and its strong cash flow have enabled the investments that are moving our business forward today. As we look ahead to the next few years, we're planning for continued investments in our business in new and remodeled stores, our supply-chain, technology, unique brands and importantly, in our team. The good news is that our business can sustain those investments while generating enough cash to support our dividend and, when we have room within our debt ratings, share repurchase.", "We entered the year with the confidence that we're making the right long-term investments in our business, and our results this year have only reinforced that confidence. As we look ahead, we expect to have ample capacity to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders allowing us to grow into an even stronger company.", "Now, I will turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Thanks, Cathy. We're going to quickly move to your questions, but I wanted to add one final note first. We are planning to host our Spring 2018 Financial Community Meeting here in Minneapolis on March 5 and 6. John Hulbert will send out more details in January, but for now, we wanted to let you know the dates so you can hold them on your calendar. We'll be scheduling the meeting to allow attendees to arrive on the afternoon of the 5th and you'll be able to return home before the end of the day on the 6th. We hope to see you at that meeting. So, with that, we will conclude our prepared remarks.", "Now, John, Mark, Cathy and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. David Schick from Consumer Edge Research, you may go ahead.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned several times throughout the call, and frankly throughout the year, that you are trying to take a conservative approach to planning, but you also mentioned \u2013 and you also mentioned the strength and the confidence you have as this quarter \u2013 that you just reported in the prior quarter happened in the traffic and the merchandising. Can you sort of square that circle for us? Because the shares are obviously reacting to guidance this morning, so help us frame conservatism versus confidence.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "David, thank you and good morning. I think sitting here today, we feel very confident that we're making very good progress against the plans that we set out earlier this year. If I think about the state of our business today, we're seeing a great response to the eight new brands that we've launched. As we've remodeled now over 100 stores, we continue to see the lift that we were projecting up 2% to 4%. We've seen a tremendous response to our new small formats that we've been opening up in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. And as you know, we opened up a number of new stores in this last quarter. And whether it was the results we've seen in Herald Square or all the way out in Hawaii, the guest has responded very, very well.", "We continue to see very strong performance from a digital standpoint, outpacing the industry by a 2x factor. And during the quarter again, we saw very strong digital growth, and that's been underpinned by the progress we've made from a digital fulfillment standpoint and some of the things that John talked about during his prepared remarks. So sitting here today, I think we're making great progress, and I think we'll continue to see that progress extend into the fourth quarter.", "So we entered the quarter with a lot of confidence. We know there's a lot of business that has to be done and we're off to a very good start led by the reaction to Hearth and Hand, as well as in the other initiatives that are in place. So I think we're taking the right approach, but we entered the quarter with a lot of confidence and making a lot of progress against literally every initiative that we've set forth earlier this year.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Just to sort of follow up to that, is there any \u2013 what would be the \u2013 do you expect to backslide against any traction in key variables, comp, gross profit dollar comp? Help us understand that with this confidence in the guide.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "David, we don't expect to see any deterioration in the progress that we've been making throughout the year. So, again, I think we enter the fourth quarter highly confident and a very strong position with our stores performing incredibly well. Great merchandise, a terrific marketing campaign, great digital capabilities and an expanded suite of digital fulfillment capability. So we feel very good about how the entire business is set to perform in the fourth quarter.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Thank you so much.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Peter Benedict from Baird, you may go ahead.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Oh, hi. Thanks, guys. So just on price perception, the work you've been doing, I mean, it sounds like you're pleased with where you've gotten that now at the end of third quarter. Just \u2013 I mean, do you think that that's an ongoing process that you're going to have to do? How are you \u2013 you mentioned some of the measurements you're using on that, but just trying to understand is that something you let ride here for the fourth quarter and then reassess where you are next year, or do you feel like you've gotten yourself to a spot where there's going to be no further adjustments required?", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Peter, I think Mark and his team have made tremendous progress over the course of the year. And as we've talked about a number of times now, we're seeing a significant shift of our business towards everyday regular price which is really important over the long term. So we're going to continue to make sure that we're committed to offering great value, that we're priced right daily. And during the fourth quarter, we'll provide exciting promotions to support those items that we know our guests are going to be interested in shopping for at Target. So it's an ongoing commitment. We want to make sure we deliver great value across the seasons and we're going to make sure that we couple that with exciting promotions in the fourth quarter.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then one maybe follow up for John, you talked about a lot of the fulfillment options that you guys are working on. Help us through how does that impact the store labor model as you see kind of going forward? And within that, the $15 minimum wage plan, I understand that's not a \u2013 it's not a fourth quarter question, it's more just as we look out the next few years, how do you see that \u2013 those having an impact on the labor? Thank you.", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "Well, I think clearly as we do more fulfillment out of the store, we will add labor to support that. I think we've said since February, we're going to invest in the labor in our stores, invest in training, invest in having experts in the store, invest in having people on the sales floor and changing the operating model for those stores. So that's an important part of what we're doing. Almost separately and independently, we're building teams that \u2013 so that we don't take hours away from everything else we're doing that are handling the fulfillment in the backroom.", "So it's really a question of the operating model in the store that's evolving. And we feel really good about utilizing the stores that are the closest, fastest and cheapest way to get merchandise to our guests. They have significant capabilities now. We're doing same day, next day, two day, pickup, Drive Up, all kinds of ways to meet the guests' needs, and I think that's the important factor, all centered around using the store as the hub. And we think it's a highly efficient way to use our assets and we have great teams that can meet the capabilities that we need for our guests.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Peter, thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. So I guess my first question really is around the fourth quarter and the comparisons that you were facing last year. So in-store comps were particularly soft, gross margin was down a lot, there was issues around digital fulfillment. I guess \u2013 you talk about the underlying momentum of the business not stalling at all, but can you talk about how you expect to cycle those issues from last year?", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Ed, again, as we enter this season, I think we're in a much stronger position. John underscored the fact that we've got an expanded array of digital fulfillment capabilities. Mark's talked about the progress we've made from both a brand standpoint, but also a value standpoint. I think we continue to enhance our digital capabilities. So I think we enter this season in a much stronger position. And I think what's really important to recognize is the investments we've made in our team and our stores puts us in a very strong position as we enter the fourth quarter.", "So I feel great about the investments we've made in wages, in hours, in seasonal hiring, and I think our stores are going to drive both our digital business and our store business throughout the fourth quarter. So I think we enter the season in a very different position versus last year. And I think that's reflected in the start that we've seen to the season and the approach we're taking throughout the fourth quarter.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Okay. And second question for you, I just want to \u2013 I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but I was hoping that maybe you could talk about the puts and the takes in terms of what we should be thinking about, areas that you could see outsized investment. D&A is going to be a headwind next year, wages clearly seem like they'll be a headwind, your thoughts on price investments from here. The Street's sort of looking for a modest decline in earnings. Seems like something like that \u2013 larger than that's possible. I just \u2013 I don't know how much at this point, Brian, you can help with that, but I think it is an area that we're all sort of wrestling with.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Well, Ed, we're hopeful that you'll join us in March for next year's Financial Community Day. Obviously, we're not going to provide 2018 guidance today. But I'll give you a preview. You're going to hear us talk about many of the same things we've been talking about this year: Our commitment to the store experience and continuing to remodel stores across the country. Our commitment to opening up new small formats in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. Our continued commitment to digital. Our commitment to enhancing our fulfillment capabilities. Our continued commitment to new brands and building our proprietary fleet of brands, and an ongoing commitment to value. And all of that will be underscored by our commitment to our team.", "So we'll go through that in much more detail in March. But as a preview, we're going to be talking about the exact same suite of initiatives next year that we've been talking about this year. We feel great about the progress. Our strategy is working. Each one of those initiatives is on track or ahead of schedule, and we expect to accelerate those initiatives in 2018.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Chris Horvers from JPMorgan, you may go ahead.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. So first, can you talk about how the essentials category \u2013 it was down slightly. You mentioned more share being taken on the unit side. Can you talk about unit growth in essentials and how that's progressed over the past couple of quarters as you've put more muscle behind the price investments?", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Sure. Chris, why don't we let Mark walk you through how we're approaching our investments in essentials.", "Mark J. Tritton - Target Corp.", "Hi, Chris. Yeah, let me share with you. So we've been sharing this year that we took a journey in terms of ensuring we were priced right daily and that we were able to create and communicate to our guests the right value, and that started in April of this year and we completed that through the end of the third quarter. What we've seen with that is, we had an expectation that that's not an immediate (49:01) response we need to build, ongoing deeper trust with the guests and get them to connect with that priced right daily ethos and we've seen a really fast reaction, a positive reaction to that.", "So we're creating in trips and traffic with our adjustment on \u2013 to be priced right daily. And as a result, we're seeing an increase in our unit velocity and we fully expected and banked in some of the short-term sales deflation that we would see as a result. But we're starting to see that equal out and we expect that stability to continue through the fourth quarter and into 2018.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, I think in the second quarter, I think essentials was up slightly. So did it \u2013 was it essentially that the price investment accelerated and the unit velocity maintained or \u2013 maintain its positive trajectory or did it accelerate?", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Yeah. Chris, I think that's exactly what we're seeing, continued investment across multiple categories. And as Mark talked about, the first thing we see is an increase in units, an increase in trips and ultimately that's going to drive positive comps over time. So, I think the efforts are paying off relatively quickly and we feel really good about the guest response.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. Have a great holiday.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. You may go ahead.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Hey, Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Just had two questions. Good morning. The first one is on in-stocks or out-of-stocks, you look at the inventory levels that Cathy talked about, are you seeing the in-stock levels where you'd like them at this point? And then the second question that I have is around fulfillment costs, when you look at \u2013 I think you said \u2013 I think John said stores are fulfilling more than 50% of digital, peak at 80%. When you think about the fourth quarter and the costs around that increased fulfillment of digital by the stores, is it a one-for-one basis in terms of the level of increases there?", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "I'll start with the in-stock question. I think, Bob, we talked about in-stocks last year in February. It's a journey for us. We know, I think we've made a lot of progress in in-stocks given our current capabilities, but we also said in order to really solve the problem, we need to fix some fundamental capabilities in our supply chain around speed, reliability, inventory placement, and that's where we are on the journey.", "So, the inventory increase at the end of Q3, as Mark said, more related to us being sure we're ready for the fourth quarter in categories like electronics, Hearth and Hand, where we took positions, intentional inventory positions, to increase inventories in advance of the fourth quarter, less to do with our management of day-to-day in-stocks/out-of-stocks. We continue to work on those. And as I said, there's the short term working within our current capabilities and then the longer term solve that comes as we continue to improve our overall supply chain capabilities.", "Your second question, I'm not entirely clear, Bob, on where you're going. Maybe you could clarify how fulfill \u2013 your question, the store labor related to fulfillment, I'm not \u2013 I didn't quite understand it.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah. Sorry. Just from the perspective of the expense levels, like the pressure that you saw in the third quarter versus the expectation of the pressure fulfilling more than 80% in the stores on the expense line, specifically.", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "Yeah. I wouldn't compare to third quarter. Compared to last year, we are doing more fulfillment in-store. As we said, we think that's the most cost-effective way given the total P&L, so shipping plus store labor, we think that's the most cost-effective way to do it. Compared to last year, we saw significant spikes last year near the end of the quarter, approaching 80% fulfillment. And I would say, when we get into that 80% range what really goes up is store pickup, and we'll take that model all day long, highly efficient for us, highly profitable from a digital perspective. So, when our mix gets that high in-store, we actually like the economics a lot.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you so much. Good morning. I have got two questions, and my first relates to gross margin. Just to revisit, the fact that you do have this very depressed compare from a year ago and you're actually entering Q4 with pretty good gross margin momentum, down only very nominally in Q3 as some of your new brands are really starting to get traction. So, is your thinking on the expectation of a declining gross margin simply a factor of more business being done online each year and the cost of fulfillment associated with that, or are some of the new fulfillment options that you're introducing just somewhat more costly and you're giving yourself rooms to absorb that pressure?", "Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.", "Good morning, Matt. This is Cathy.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi.", "Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.", "I think I would look about it the way we always \u2013 we have all year approaching it, which is we're trying to be prudent as we plan into the fourth quarter. We're excited about what we've seen so far, but it's early in a very important quarter.", "The pressure that we are anticipating is around digital fulfillment, as well as all the work we continue to do around value. And we're offsetting that with cost savings continuing into the fourth quarter. So I would look at it as just doing what we said we would do all year long, which is be prudent, plan appropriately, and make sure that we set the business up for success.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Yes, Matt, I'd only build on a couple of the comments that Cathy made: One, we feel very good about the performance of our owned brands, and from a gross margin standpoint, both short term and long-term, that's going to be very beneficial to our mix. Two, we are clearly investing in digital and digital capabilities, and expect that we're going to continue to see strong digital growth in the fourth quarter.", "So it is the mix of our business that really makes sure that our gross margin returns stay on track. But the work that Mark and his team have done with our owned brands and the results that we're seeing across our eight new brands is very beneficial both short term and long term to our gross margin rate performance.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "That's super helpful. The quick follow-up relates to REDcard penetration. So we noted that the year-on-year penetration seems to have stabilized this quarter after having shown some increases for a period of time. Anything to glean from the stabilization of that trend?", "Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.", "We are really excited about some of the capabilities we're adding to REDcard coming into this fourth quarter. I have to tell you, I'm one of the early users for our wallet application, and it is phenomenally fast and convenient and great experience for the guests. So as we've continued to ramp up some exclusives around REDcard, our guests are responding. We're seeing additional capabilities come into REDcard holders, our best guests into the fourth quarter, so I would expect that we'll see that trend continuing to be favorable.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Yeah. Matt, I think we also recognize that as a byproduct of the investments we've been making in our stores, our brands, moving into new neighborhoods, we're bringing in new guests to Target. So over time, we certainly want to convert them to REDcard holders. But I think what we're seeing is, as we move into new catchments, these are new guests that are shopping at Target. Over time, they'll start adapting to our REDcard. I think our new brands are bringing new guests into our stores, and I think the focus that we've placed around value is also attracting a new shopper.", "So over time, that provides us tremendous opportunities to continue to build REDcard penetration. And one of the metrics that we haven't talked about on the call is the fact that traffic was up 1.4%. And that's existing guests shopping more often, but it also is new guests coming to our stores and our site. So over time, those are potential new prospects for our REDcard, and we certainly expect to see that conversion as we go into 2018.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you so much, guys.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may go ahead.", "Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Oh, thanks. Just two quick questions. Just on the fourth quarter, the sort of the breadth of the range there, can you just give us the scenarios, like sort of what brings you to the low-end of the fourth quarter range, the $1.05 versus the $1.25?", "And the other question I had was just I was wondering if you would share some of the early results on the pickup customer versus the Drive Up customer, which is better, whose basket is bigger, how much bigger is the basket versus the store shopper or just plain online shopper that gets shipped to home? Anything you can share about the metrics and what you're excited about there? Thanks.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Robby, why don't we let John start by talking about that pickup shopper, and then we'll come back to our guidance for the quarter?", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "I might start with the Drive Up shopper there. I think our guest survey scores there, NPS scores, are frankly off the charts. We see a high utility. It's mom with two kids in the back, it's our core Target shopper who just doesn't \u2013 it's raining outside and doesn't want to get out of the car. So we've seen very, very high scores there.", "The baskets are mixed, as you'd imagine, right? Sometimes they're larger, sometimes it's I need one thing. And the same is very true for pickup in-store, driven by \u2013 it can be driven by promotional cadence, it can be driven by convenience. There's lots of different reasons people choose that option, and so the basket varies. There's nothing really to glean from that other than for both of them we see very high NPS scores for our guests which is the most important thing from our perspective.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Robby, why don't I clear up the question around guidance for the quarter, and really I'll focus on the full year. I think our fourth quarter guidance is a reflection of the performance we've been delivering throughout the year. And I'll go back and note, as Cathy discussed, our full year guidance is up $0.50. Now, I'll do the math for you. That's $500 million of improvement versus our original guidance. So we certainly approach the fourth quarter with a level of balance and conservatism, but feel good about the momentum that we have and we think the performance we've been delivering throughout the year will be reflected in our fourth quarter.", "So we feel confident, we're making good progress. There's a lot of business still to be done in the fourth quarter, and I think our range of comp of flat to 2% and the approach we're taking from an EPS standpoint just reflects the approach we've been taking throughout the year.", "So with that, I think, operator, we've got time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Kate McShane from Citi, you may go ahead.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My question was around fulfillment as well and a little bit longer term in nature. I had wondered with regards to the Drive Up and the same-day delivery, if there are any early indications of what the limitations might be in terms of where you can introduce that. And then also with regards to the profitability of how those two fulfillment options relate to the ship-from-store.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "Yeah. I'll let John talk about the profitability component, but, Kate, I think one of the great things about our strategy is the important role our stores play. And as we think about Drive Up, we think about same-day, those are going to be enabled by the 1,800 stores that are in neighborhoods around the country. So we should be able to continue to expand that over time and meet the needs of our guests no matter where they live and which store they shop in.", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "And on your question about profitability, clearly, the closer we are to the store, the better we like it. When a guest comes in and takes it off the shelf, great. Only slightly disadvantage to that would be pickup or Drive Up because there is one more touch, but really again economically a great, great solution for us. As we get into shipping, same-day delivery is more expensive. There's no question about that. And at least today, our guest research leads us to believe guests understand that. They want it priced right, they want the convenience, and they understand there may be a charge to get it to them at the time they wanted during that day. And we've seen that in the four stores in New York, no pushback at all in the delivery charge.", "And we \u2013 the great thing is, we see the baskets, as I said, six to nine times larger, so it ends up being a highly, highly profitable transaction for us. And so there are markets where that will work \u2013 that type of transaction will work really well. There are other markets where, as you said, there'll be standard two-day shipping in there. We're working hard to reduce cost throughout that shipping while improving the speed. And so that's on our team so that the guests get the great service and we make that a great economic transaction for Target as well.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "All right.", "John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.", "But we feel good about our ability to make all of it work.", "Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.", "So with that, operator, that concludes our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
