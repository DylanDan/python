I'm pleased with our operating performance as we posted another quarter of solid results with improved constant currency strength across all of our business segments. Excluding the one-time charge, profit margins expanded 90 basis points compared to the prior year. And we continued to return significant funds to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. While economic currency and geopolitical challenges remain in many parts of the world, we are pleased with our performance and business trends. As a result, we have raised our full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth.", "In the quarter, consumer money transfer was led by a healthy U.S. outbound business and good transactions growth in markets such as Germany and UK, which offset continued challenges in Russia and some African countries. Westernunion.com again delivered strong growth in the quarter not only in the U.S., but across most of the countries where we have transaction sites.", "Customers using online or mobile to send money to bank accounts are providing incremental business. Improvements in mobile access such as with our new UK app are also producing results. Our consumer money transfer pricing has been stable as the net pricing investment for both the second quarter and the first half of the year was minimum.", "Western Union Business Solutions delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth as we continue to focus on our strategy of providing specialized products and services. Consumer bill payments also provided strong growth with good performance from both our Argentina walk-in business and U.S. electronic bill pay.", "Now before I turn to call over to Raj for the financial results, I would like to take few minutes to discuss the industry landscape and our strategic focus. As I have stated in the past, our vision is to be recognized leader in cross-border constant currency money transfer for consumers and businesses.", "For the consumer money transfer market, we expect digital-initiated transaction will be fast growing over the next several years, and we also believe retail-initiated transaction will continue to provide a steady business and remain a very sizable portion of the market.", "As you know, cross-border money transfer has different dynamics within the different countries and customer segments. On the receive side, we believe cash will remain critical in much of the world for the foreseeable future. At the same time, the account side of the receive market represents incremental opportunities.", "Western Union has great global assets to leverage. We have a strong brand which stands for trust and reliability with our customers. We already have regulatory and compliance programs that allow us to operate in more than 200 countries and territories. We have an extensive funds-in and funds-out network the connects over 0.5 million diverse retail agent locations, ATMs, and kiosks, our own and third-party digital sites and mobile wallets.", "We are adding direct access to millions of paying accounts, and our network also gives us the ability to offer tailored cross-border B2B, B2C, C2B solutions. We have a cross-border platform that provides the technology, foreign exchange conversion and settlement, regulatory and compliance infrastructure and data management that brings our network together. This platform allows an effective and timely money movement for multiple used cases almost anywhere in the world.", "We are building on this strength to expand our network even further and open it to new types of players. Today, we are very well positioned as we have been heavily investing in our digital, compliance, and IT capabilities, for the last few years. And we continue to enhance our platform. Just in the first half of the year, we announced new agreements with MTN for mobile money transfer in Rwanda and in the Ivory Coast. New connections to the ATMs in Poland, new self-service kiosks in with WHSmith in the UK and new card and ATM based services through MasterCard at Banca Transylvania in Romania. Western Union Business Solutions formed a mass payment alliance with Hyperwallet, and signed agreements with Tower Watson for cross border payroll, and with North Western University for education payments.", "We also entered other new Asian relationships such as with the Bank of China and Sainsbury's Bank, UK's first supermarket bank. And we renewed several other agents around the world, including the expansion of our long-standing relationship with Kroger here in the U.S. earlier this month. Our digital business is already strong with approximately $250 million in revenues last year and strong growth again this year.", "We now have online sites in 29 markets to send money around the world, and we plan to leverage our brands, global presence and regulate the relationships to add even more markets over the next couple of years. We are opening a digital hub in Asia that will help us move faster to establish and develop online and mobile business across the Middle East, Africa, Asia the CIS and other international markets. While we have already an established retail payout, we will continue to add to the more than 50 countries where we can now deposit funds into banks and mobile accounts.", "From this foundation, we believe, we are very competitive. And we offer a strong proposition that is difficult for others to replicate on a global scale. The payment base is clearly seeing some exciting developments. At Western Union, we are focused on innovation and new technology. And we are fortunate to already have a strong core asset that support global money movement. So I hope I was able to give you some brief insight into Western Union Brazilian global business model, our competitive strength and our future strategy.", "Now coming back to the second quarter results, once again we are pleased with the performance and improved revenue trend and with the raised outlook for the year.", "Now I will turn the call over to Raj to provide you a more detailed review of the quarter.", "A - Rajesh Agrawal", "Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter revenue of $1.4 billion was down 2% compared to the prior year period during - due to the strength of the U.S. dollar but revenue on a constant currency basis increased 4%. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $85 million compared to the prior year period. In the consumer to consumer segment, reported revenue decreased 3% but increased 3% constant currency. Transactions also grew 3% in the quarter.", "B2C cross border principal declined 5% or increased 2% constant currency. Principal for transaction was down 7% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as the decline was only 1% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately six percentage points. The differential was due to a negative 6% impact in currency. Both net pricing and mix impacts were minimal in the quarter. We did implement some price reductions in the high principal band of our U.S. domestic money transfer business in early April. These were implemented in certain parts of the country where we were seeing competitive impact. While it would take several quarters to fully judge the results, we are seeing improved transaction trends in the price stand, which contributed to a 4% in [indiscernible transactions in the quarter.", "Turning to the regions. Due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, as I've discussed individual country contributions to the regional result, I will be referring to constant currency movements.", "In Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 9% or increased 2% constant currency while transactions increased 1%. Germany and the UK delivered good revenue growth in the quarter, which partially offset by continued declines in Russia. I also want to give you a quick update on Greece. The money transfer industry was affected by the government mandated bank holiday implemented in late June and money transfer transactions were not allowed, midway through July, some inbound business was reopened with limitations on withdrawal. We are very pleased that starting this week, we've been able to reopen our services in many agent locations without limitations on inbound transfers, so our valued customers in Greece are now able to receive much needed funds. For reference, Greece represents just under 1% of company revenues last year, and prior to the current crisis, the business was split 50/50 between inbound and outbound.", "North America revenue declined 2% or 1% on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. The U.S. outbound growth was strong in the quarter, driven primarily by spends to Latin America and Mexico. Our Mexico business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data that the first two months of the quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue declined 4% while transactions increased 4%, an improvement from the first quarter's 2% transaction growth. In the Middle and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency and transactions reflect. The region benefited from growth in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and the Nigeria outbound business, which was partially offset by continued geopolitical driven weakness in Angola and Libya. In Asia Pacific revenue was down 5% or flat constant currency. Transactions in the region declined 3%.", "Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region increased 6% from the prior year quarter or 13% constant currency, while transactions increased 7%. Strong inbound business from the U.S. as well as outbound strength from Argentina drove the growth in the region.", "Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 22% in the quarter or 28% constant currency. Westernunion.com transactions increased 27%. U.S. originated online transactions grew 33% and the U.S. outbound quarters were even stronger. Electronics channels revenue which includes WU.com account-based money transfer through banks and mobile money transfer increased 19% in the quarter and represented 7% of total company revenue.", "In the Consumer-to-Consumer business segment, revenue increased 8% or 12% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which is partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions, reported a revenue decline of 1% or an increase of 9% constant currency.", "Revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products. As we discussed margins and earnings per share, unless otherwise noted, my comments would exclude the impact of the settlement agreement reached between our Paymap business which is part of the Consumer-to-Business segment and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. During - due to this agreement, we have accrued $35.3 million in the course results claims regarding the marketing or Paymap equity accelerated service after tax, the impact was $24.2 million or $0.05 per share. The consolidated operating profit margin excluding the charge was 20.7% in the second quarter compared to 19.8% in the prior year period.", "The operating margin improvement was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and the net impact of foreign currency movements which are partially offset by increases in incentive compensation, compliance, and technology expense. While the overall impacted currency translation negatively impacted revenue and profitability in the quarter, the operating margin percentage benefited from hedge gains as profit was proportionately less impacted by currency than revenues.", "In the quarter, we recorded approximately $20 million of hedge in our revenue line and these also flow through to the operating profit. Excluding all impacts of currency, operating margin still improved compared to the year-ago period. Approximately $9 million of incremental savings were identified in the second quarter from cost savings initiatives. We continue to expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of savings this year from programs implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014, and another $10 million to $15 million of incremental savings from the 2013 programs.", "Compliance expense was approximately 3.7% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 3.2% in the prior year period and we still expect the range of 3.5% to 4% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.2% in the quarter compared to 24.7% in the prior year period. While our tax rate of 11.8% was down from 16.5% in the prior year. Including the impact of settlement charges, the reported tax rate was 3.5%.", "Adjusted earnings per share are $0.41, increased 14% from $0.36 in the prior year period, driven by the operating margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate, and your shares outstanding. GAAP earnings per share which includes the settlement was $0.36. The C2C operating margin was 23.3%, compared to 22.7% in the prior-year period. The C2C margin benefited from cost savings initiatives and the net impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by increased compliance and incentive compensation costs. The consumer to business operating margin was 18.3% in the quarter, excluding a settlement charge, compared to 16.2% in the prior-year period. The margin increase was driven by higher revenue and cost savings initiatives.", "Business Solutions reported breakeven profit for the quarter, compared to a loss of $3 million for the same period last year. The improvement in operating profit for Business Solutions in the quarter was primarily due to lower amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $12 million in the quarter compared to $15 million in the prior year period.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $466 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $78 million for the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion, and cash of $1.6 billion. Approximately 40% of the cash was held by United States entities. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for a total of $156 million. Our remaining authorizations of $906 million expires in December 2017.", "We also paid $79 million in dividend in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had 512 million shares outstanding. Based on the results for the first-half and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlooks for adjusted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth. We now expect, low to mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the year, compared to low-single digit growth in our previous outlook.", "Our operating margin outlook remains at approximately 21% excluding the Paymap settlement or approximately 20% including the charge. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 13% although the GAAP rate is now projected at approximately 12%. We've raised the adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.02 to a range of $1.60 to $1.67. On a GAAP basis, the range would be $0.05 lower. We are pleased with the second quarter results including good revenue trends and cost management and are confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane", "Hi, guys. Just wondering of your big picture question, Hikmet, lots of M&A activity in this space - remittance space. It seems like Western Union is kind of wants to stay away from making any acquisitions of any size, of any materials. So could you maybe just give us some thoughts on acquisition strategy and kind of your thoughts Western Union kind of doing this on a standalone basis?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Great question, Bryan. First of all, we're very pleased with our performance, obviously we are really executing on the markets. Again another quarter, solid quarter, and I believe also our digital strategy and our portfolio expansion is working, core business delivering. And that's great. Build on that strength, we are always looking for acquisition opportunities to enhance our cross-border money movement capabilities our platform and also expanding our portfolio, we're always looking at that, but we've been - we are pleased with our, we're focused on our performance, we are pleased with our performance. If you look at acquisition, we'd need to have a strong cash-on-cash returns, and we believe also the acquisition candidate should be really has to fit within our strategy, has to really help to us to execute good in the market and long-term has to benefit for us. So, we're always looking at the acquisition possible, it is but, it has to fit, and we're going to continue to execute with our business.", "Bryan Keane", "But it doesn't seem like anything eminent or there are bunch of big deals that are close to looking at?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We're really looking always, all possibilities, but, we're very much focused on as you know the company policy, we don't make any comments on the acquisitions. And so, I think we are very much focused on the, our execution.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay. And then just Raj, obviously volatility in FX is playing a role. Can you just may be help us understand how that's influencing the model kind of the puts and takes for the both revenue and margin.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "I'm sure, Bryan, the volatility itself has more of a direct impact, in our B2B business, we see that impact the business in the short-term , long-term results in the B2B business are really driven overall market growth and the things that we're executing upon. From a volatility standpoint, for the consumer business, there's not much of an impact, we have seen some additional movement there in certain markets like the U.S. and the UK to India or the U.S. to Mexico as those currencies have moved. But nothing dramatic on the consumer side of the equation. Just generally, our trends have been improving. We've seen good U.S. hop on fund trends, we've seen good performance in parts of Europe, although with challenges in Russia obviously. But even in the Middle East, we've seen good performance with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and even in Nigeria, our hop on business is there.", "So, pockets of strength around the world, not necessarily driven by currency volatility, really just by good performance in those particular geographies.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay, helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Hi, great. Thanks, good quarter here. Just building on Bryan's question, on just on hedge gains then. I guess, $36 million year-to-date, what's sort of the second half outlook on the hedge gain front if rates hold there?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Sure. Tien-tsin, this is Raj. We still expect to achieve about $70 million in hedge gains for the year. $16 million in the first quarter as you know, and then $20 million in the second quarter, and then still $70 million, and that's assuming that rates stay roughly where they are today. We had assumed about a $1.10 coming into the year for the euro and that's roughly where the rate has been.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "All right. Terrific. Just wanted to check there. Just I guess back to the business on the pricing front, good to hear everything is holding stable. What sort of the outlook for the year specifically I guess for the second half you had some price actions, embedded in the outlook, do you have that lead or ready to pull or does it feel like we're more of in a stable environment here?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Well, generally as you know, Tien-tsin our business, we do a pricing actions as we did it also in the U.S. corridor. But we do it corridor-by-corridor, selective pricing actions. I believe that the business is quite stable, we are wining, we're quite competitive. The people really trust our brand, trust our network, trust our capabilities on the multi settlement and everything. Our platform is really working pretty well, within that environment, we feel currently quite stable on the pricing investment. So, I think we're going to continue to do corridor by corridor and area by area pricing investment as we did in past always, but I don't feel that for this year we're going to do big pricing investments.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "All right. That was great. Great quarter, thanks.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Thanks", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Tien-tsin.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Smitty Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.", "Smitty Srethapramote", "Great, thank you. So this was the first quarter where I think I've noticed that constant currency revenue growth in WU.com was higher than transaction growth. Can you talk just talk about that this, I guess this development? Are you guys falling back on promotions and what kind of growth rates should we be expecting WU.com in the going forward [indiscernible].", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Hi, Smitty. This is Raj. We are very pleased with the growth that we've gotten in the WU.com business and the strategies that we've put in place that are really starting to work for us. The business has really been focused on expanding geographically and you see that in 29 markets now. We are also improving upon the customer experience by adding more features and functionality to our platforms and ultimately getting more conversion of customers, and we're also expanding channel capabilities. So more bank funding, more bank payout. We also have mobile capability in the U.S., UK, and Australia. So all of those things put together are really helping to drive good revenue growth. Having said that we continue to look at opportunities to do price promotions that's an ongoing activity that we have, and - but you're seeing those two things tighten a little bit. We're pleased with the 27% transaction because that just gives you an indicator of how healthy the business is. And I would say our principal growth has been even far above our revenue growth. So we're gaining share in that part of the market and we feel really good about where that business is headed.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think also to add on that our mobile strategy is working pretty well there. We're going to expand that mobile strategy also to the other countries. And one thing also you heard that me saying that, we're going to open an digital hub in Asia. We want to go to new countries also with that one. And basically we are going to use our existing business model, which we create in San Francisco, which we've been so very successful. And really taking that and opening new countries to expand our digital. And the trick is obviously combining digital and with retail payout different dynamics. Our omnichannel strategy is working. So I am pleased with that also.", "Smitty Srethapramote", "Great. Thank you for that. And maybe just a follow-up question. Just wondering what kind of reactions you have to the proposed PayPal to combination?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I can't make a comment on PayPal or nor Xoom obviously. But I think that we are pretty much, we our business, our visual business is really pretty good as I mentioned earlier. But I think we are going to concentrate. I'm going to expand our digital business. It has a very strong growth. We are also with our platform. We are looking also at different customer segments, different players, which joining an example is, one of the examples which is growing very well is our financial institutions web pages like Scotiabank or like Swiss Post bank. They are using our platform to send money worldwide. So it's bank [indiscernible] standard on their webpage using Western Union, dropping money to 200 countries. That's the platform strength we have it. I think we're going to concentrate on that. So this platform is, it didn't happen to us yesterday, right? We build at over years, it's very strong, and it is - you have to - it's a really competitive advantage and the cash payout is extremely important in different parts of the world, as you know, and that's definitely we feel quite competitive to be successful in the market.", "Smitty Srethapramote", "Okay. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Smitty.", "Operator", "And our next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider", "Thanks for taking my question. As more you if you can follow up on the previous one, if in fact PayPal does expand the zoom offering into more markets than the U.S. outbound. Can you maybe talk about what's required in your online business to drive kind of more marketing dollars and what the historic relationship you've seen, is between our marketing dollars spent in the given geography for online channels versus transactions?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Jim, you will understand that I'll keep that in a general comment, I won't keep it my secrets - company secrets away. But to build up online business is not that easier and propping money there is not easy. You need some countries of bank licenses, you need to compliance requirements, you need to register customer, know your customer, know your age on the receive side. It's a quite complex part which we have been doing that for many years and very successful.", "What happens is that, it's not only in the send side, you also have to understand the dynamics on the receive side of the customer behavior, customer segmentation on the receive side. And what we do with our platform, as you saw in my - one of my charts, I explained it. Western Union has a diverse payout options - and because it's a choice of the consumers how they want to pick up the money, and how we want to send that. That's the biggest advantage we build over the years, and we're going to concentrate on that, on the send side maybe particularly answering that questions, you're going to concentrate on the royalty programs, on the corridor-by-corridor actions. Is it a promotions, Mother's Day promotions or is it a Christmas promotion or is in the ethnic marketing, you'll continue to be very, very focused. So, I believe that, we are very well positioned here.", "James Schneider", "That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up for Raj. On the compliance spending, 3.7% in the quarter. What's the visibility outlook into the back-half of the year? Do you think, there is an opportunity to sort of bring that down or do you think that kind of stays at the same level or even at higher level and can you maybe talk about some of the programs that are new, that are ongoing there?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Sure, Jim. We still believe that our spending this year will be in that 3.5% to 4% range, I don't have a tighter range to give you the than that. In any given quarter, the level of spending is going to vary depending on what activities we actually have going on. We're - I do believe that, we're in a more stable place this year than we have been historically on - in terms of the level of compliance spending.", "What you're really seeing coming through in the higher spend this year is all of the people that we've hired, we have over 2,000 employees in the compliance organization which is helping to strengthen our compliance capabilities, but that is adding cost to the equation issue, and that's really the step up that you're seeing. At the same time, we're also trying to optimize our spend. We're spending money in technology, we're trying to automate processes, automate activities wherever we can.", "And that's something that will make us more efficient over time. But we still are in the right range for the year of 3.5% to 4%.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Raj, I think, we're going to continue to enroll compliance programs worldwide. There will be investments, continued investments, that's also I see as an investment, because it's really a competitive, it's starting to be a competitive advantage in some countries. And the more your customer know your agent programs, it will be expanded into several countries over the coming years. To protect our customers, to protect the company, to work with the regulators to - and this is a complex business money transfer business, and within that environment, we're going to continue to invest.", "James Schneider", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "The next question is from Darrin Parrell - Darrin Peller, I'm sorry of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks, guys. My just first question on pricing again, I mean again it came up before, but good to see stability there, just Hikmet, a big picture, not necessarily this year, but used to be something that you guys would guide towards being a 1 to - maybe 1 point to 3 point pressure per year, in terms of just expected headwinds on the revenue side. We obviously haven't seen that for the last couple of quarters. Do you really think that continues or comes back in a couple of years, is the environment competitively going to cause that or is it a little bit of a better competitive landscape now?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Darrin, as you know I'm not going to give guidance for - longer guidance, but I see where we are today and you could look also the last quarters, we've been very competitive within that environment with our pricing. Darrin, as you know that doesn't mean that we're not going to do pricing, right. So, I mean we're going to really focus quarter-by-quarter. As you recall in 2012, we had one correction about our product reposition and pricing reposition, a bigger one.", "Darrin Peller", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "But since then as we said that come back, transactions and revenue will come back, and that happens. And if you do also quarter based pricing or area pricing, it takes about 18 months or something like that, the revenues also come back, you would see sudden - suddenly the transactions are coming back on the quarter-by-quarter, but we've been doing that for many years, and I believe that given our global reach, we can really do that quarter-by-quarter pricing investment. I feel comfortable where we are today.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay. All right, then just a quick question for Raj on the tax rate. I think you came in at 11.8% adjusted for the settlement. And so I just I think you had guided initially to a 13% tax rate for the year with it first half is coming in, I think about 100 basis points better than that. I guess first question is just should we still expect that for the year and then why would it increase in the second half? And then going forward, I mean is your normal tax rate still 15%.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Yes. You should still plan for about 13% adjusted for the year. There is just some geographic and business mix assumptions that we have in the full year outlook for the tax rate. So that's approximately what we expect for the year. And on a longer-term basis, assuming no other tax law changes, which is something you can't really predict and we would expect in the normal year to be in the mid-teens range.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay, guys. All right. Nice job. Thanks.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Thanks, Darrin.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Gubins", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Hi, Sara.", "Sara Gubins", "On pricing, you did lower pricing to some extent in the high principal bands in the U.S. I know it's on a selective basis. Was the impact of that just so small that it doesn't show up when we look at the overall pricing impact? Or are there some regions where pricing is coming up?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Yeah, Sara. This is Raj. We did do some price increases and decreases around the world. And that's why you see the net impact being 0% pricing for the year quarter and actually for the first half of the year. And as we've always said, we look at pricing opportunities all over the world. And how - what it takes to be competitive in certain geographies and so that can go up or down direction. So that's really why you have 0% pricing?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Just to add on this, Sara, you're right. We did some pricing investment [indiscernible] selected locations where we feel that we did that. I think [indiscernible] and car transit team did a good job to selecting the locations to very minimal pricing investment. So, we feel quite competitive and in the lower bands and also general and the U.S. domestic money transfer and U.S. outbound, and U.S. origin, the digital money transfer is doing fantastic actually. The team is doing a good job to respond to the market need. So I feel generally that we are, our pricings are stable and good for this year.", "Sara Gubins", "Great. And then a question on Europe. Transaction growth came down, when we look at year-over-year transaction growth, it came down about 300 basis points versus last quarter. You mentioned strength in Germany and U.K., and of course weakness in Russia offsetting that. But did anything change sequentially from the first quarter that might explain the weaker transaction growth?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah, Sara, the transaction growth was largely impacted by a declines in Russia. But if you look at the revenue growth, that's very consistent with the first quarter. We still had 2% constant currency revenue growth in both the first quarter and second quarter, and the transaction growth, because of the declines in the Russian business, which is at a relatively lower revenue per transaction in the rest of Europe. That's why you see the mix change happening there. So that's more of an impact on transaction growth and really not much impact on the revenue growth.", "Sara Gubins", "Great. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks Sara.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Tim Lilly of Wells Fargo.", "Tim Lilly", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Hi Tim.", "Tim Lilly", "Just had a question on the consumer business and the B2B, that consumer business growth rate of 12 constant currency is pretty strong. I guess I just want to make sure there is nothing with the U.S. transitory in the quarter that, it's not indicative of their underlying business sort of, should we think about that's really sort of the trajectory the growth rate is for the consumer to business right now.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah. Tim, that's slightly more than the first quarter, but it's pretty consistent. In the first quarter, the business grew at 11%. So nothing unusual there. We've had good performance in our Argentina business and also in our electronic payments business here in the U.S. And those are the two key growth drivers and then cash. Walk-in business here in the U.S. declined as it has in the last few quarters. So nothing really has changed in terms of overall trend there.", "Tim Lilly", "Okay. And then my second question I guess sort of that ties into the whole enterprise. But obviously the transaction growth rates and the revenue and the consumer to consumer are what they are in that low single digit give or take. A lot of people talking about pricing, but you got these two other businesses of the B2B and the C2B that are growing faster than the consumer. So I guess my question with that as a backdrop is if you can maintain transaction growth and the consumer to consumer where it's at. And there's not any kind of real degradation. Does that alleviate your concern or your willingness to cut prices, but actually focus more on the other two businesses to sort of pick up the slack? Or do you feel like if you can't reaccelerate the transaction growth in the consumer, it's somewhere, pricing would have to occur again like we did a couple of years ago.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah. I think I got your question. Let me try to answer it. So first of all if you compare our retail money transfer business is a big part of that. That's a different base than on our digital business and the business solutions. The growth rates are - they are different bases, right. One is a huge billion dollars of business. The others are known last year this will be $250 million. But, it's very strong growth, and it helps to grow the company. So, as I said in my opening comments also, we believe that, retail money transfer business continue to, retail instant, continue to be stable, and will have a lower growth rate than the digital business, which is going to be very strong growth rate, but that will, it's a different base, and it's a different customer segment.", "One good thing is also that, the digital business consumers are new to Western Union. These are new customers, we're adding. We wouldn't be so successful, if we - in digital business, if we wouldn't have that retail payout network worldwide. The connection between digital and cash payout it's really the one of the strongest growth rates, we have it globally, than the combination of omnichannel makes is successful.", "Saying that, on the digital-to-digital, it's -that's a different customer segment. We do that also if we do have a good growth rate, digital to bank accounts payout. But, generally I would say that, with the different customer segment, we have a good price positioning, to go after them. So, I don't see the big pricing investment to catch up there or to change the environment. I think, I feel comfortable with our omnichannel strategy with customer segment base pricing, promotions works pretty well, to go to the market.", "Tim Lilly", "Okay. Thanks, that's very helpful. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Tim.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Hi, Hikmet, hi Raj, and how are you guys?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Hi Ashwin, how are you?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Good, thanks. I had one question on the FX line in the C2C segment. Last quarter, you had mentioned there is some rebalancing between fees and FX. But, when I look at it in FX as a percent of C2C revenues is now up to over 24% of revenues, 18 months ago, it was less than 22%. I'm kind of wondering how sustainable is this. Do you pay commission on FX? And the pricing calculation, does that include this or not?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah. Ashwin, if you recall in the first quarter we began some and we did some rebalancing between CCs and foreign exchange. So we shifted some pricing in certain parts of our business from CCs to foreign exchange. No, overall impact to consumer pricing and no real impact on our revenue line. So it's been - you're going to see that impact throughout this course of this year until it anniversaries into next year. But that was just to realign with the market pricing and why we did the rebalancing.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "But on the FX component, do you pay commission to your agents? I mean what's the contribution margin of FX versus transaction? Just curious.", "Michael Salop", "Yeah. Hi, Ashwin. This is Mike. To answer your first question. It is included in our pricing numbers. So the changes in the FX price is part of the pricing calculation as well. It depends on the country. In some countries, we pay commissions on the FX, in other countries we don't. So it just depends on which corridors we are talking about.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. And sort of a broader question. You guys have had a very stable call it 3% transaction growth in North America now for many quarters. Is this a looking at sort of a late [indiscernible] business. Is this the right level of transaction growth for our modeling purposes or can you accelerate it, or is it sort of the stable network?", "Michael Salop", "In the U.S. market, it has been pretty consistent transaction growth. This year it's really about the economic conditions that we see. We've seen continued good growth in the U.S. market. U.S. outbound LACA has continued to stay strong. U.S. to Mexico has also been very strong for us. And we have our TMT business that we just saw some acceleration in transaction growth. So that's a component of it as well. It's hard to predict exactly where with the transaction growth will be for that business, but we're pleased with the direction that it's had in the last few quarters.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah, I think - also all the promotion actions and all the online business doing very well, especially the mobile is a big step in the U.S. I'm very pleased with the mobile penetration and the lower bands the people are really using it. And it is very convenient. It's nice you have the mobile app, you send money and somebody anywhere who lives in the 50,000 locations in the U.S. can pick up the money immediately. So that's something that we'll debt and it's also outbound business is very strong. And I think that it's a good market.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Right. So sounds like, you guys can keep it stable going forward. Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "And we have Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Hey, guys. How are you?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Hi, Jason. Good.", "Jason Kupferberg", "So on WU.com, I was curious to get a sense of what percent of the volume going through there is now paid out in cash versus being paid to an account? And where might you like to see that metric get over the next year or two? Obviously, it would be advantages if you guys can avoid some of the agent costs there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah. The vast majority of the business is still paid out to an agent location. However, the bank payout and the bank funding of that - of those transactions is one of the faster growing areas is still small portion of the business, but still the largest used case is to pay out in cash, and again we're trying to create this omnichannel capability where consumers have an opportunity to use this however they want, whether it's cash at a retail location, or mobile, or bank, or our online business, so however they want to transact with us, that's really what we're driving towards. So cash is still obviously a very important component of the equation, but bank payout, and bank funding are going to become more part of the mix as we move forward.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Especially in the sense, it really depends on the country, it depends on the corridor, right. In countries where you send money, where the people need to pay out in cash in the corridor, it's extremely high growth rate but in the sense that there is a different use case, that people want to use online maybe sometimes credit card fund it, sometimes ACA, sometimes especially in Europe, debit cards and debit accounts funded but on the receive side, we see a huge, the agent locations advantage is huge to cash payout, but as Raj said that it's small, but we see also very fast growth rate on the bank account and mobile wallet payout, so that's something that we're also focused.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's largely an incremental opportunity for us. The bank payout. We typically don't see a shift of preference there, it's really an incremental opportunity for us.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Yeah, that's the way it sounds. And then just a follow-up question generally on costs, I know you're still working your way through some of the cost savings from prior actions, should we think of your overall cost base is being pretty well optimized at this point, obviously you made the investments in compliance for example, and you've done a good amount of cost take out in prior years or do you still think that you can sort out some additional opportunities that might even be significant enough for you to be able to call out at some point.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah. I mean Jason, we're always looking for opportunities to take some cost out and optimize and we, we continue to evaluate opportunities, as you said, we've done in quite a bit already. We still are looking at ways of optimizing our overall distribution cost. So we really look at the mix of that business and how that's going to drive distribution costs down over time, and that is our single biggest cost item in our cost structure as you know. And then we, the compliance has certainly become more stable, I would say this year than we've seen in the last few years, we have a better handle on it. And then in our fixed and variable cost structure, other variable costs, we're also looking at opportunities. So, certainly if there is something of significance, we would definitely call it out to you, at some point in the future.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay. That makes sense. Thanks guys.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks Jason.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Thanks Jason.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kevin Macquarrie of Macquarrie.", "Kevin Macquarrie", "Great, thanks. I wonder if you could give us a sense, from pricing perspective. Is some of that being held by capacity coming out as a result just the cost of the compliant, being two ownership at this point for certain markets?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Kevin, on the compliance, we - if I understand your correct question correctly. We have compliance activities that are ongoing in nature. So we have many markets and geographies, where we're implementing programs. Even if we complete those activities,, we know that we have more regions and markets in which to go to. And so that's why we've continued to see some higher level of spending in the compliance side, and that's where we are today. But, if things don't necessarily just drop off.", "Michael Salop", "I think if you're referring to the industry in general, Kevin yeah, we do think costs are going up for competitors most probably playing into pricing in the industry.", "Kevin Macquarrie", "Yeah, with more along those lines, Mike. And then just any thoughts on Hyperwallet the JV has that been going?", "Michael Salop", "Yeah, it's early in the relationship. It's within our B2B business that we've entered into this relationship and it allows us to deliver mass payments around the world in an easier way. Hyperwallet has a receiver-oriented portal that ultimately requires the beneficiaries that input their information. So it makes it easier. The sender doesn't have to know every single beneficiary detail. And so instead of having to put thousands of data points into a system, you can rely on the beneficiary to actually pull the payment to wherever they want to. So it's easier for them to do mass payments. And it's applicable in the B2C space mostly and pension payments or payroll.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think it's C2B strategy also - it's not only - what we do is that it's not only sender decision, it's also, should be a receiver decision, how to pullout the money, where to direct the money? And this kind of relationships helps us as we expand our receiver driven products, also to different countries. And one thing we realize that the receiver wants to also have the choice, sending money at cash or account. Or even sometimes dividing the money, half of the money to an account, half of the payout in cash. So something like that. Relationships like Hyperwallet hubs on our future [indiscernible].", "Kevin Macquarrie", "Great. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Michael Salop", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Veytsman of Monness, Crespi.", "Alex Veytsman", "Yes, well, guys, just wanted to ask about the C2B growth. There was strong acceleration at this quarter from the prior quarter. What were the main drivers in C2B and kind of where do you see it for the rest of the year?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Yeah. The business grew 11% in the first quarter and 12% this quarter on a constant currency basis. The drivers have been the same that we've seen for the last few quarters. We had good growth in our Argentina business and we also had good growth in our electronic payments business here in the U.S. And we have a little bit of offset from the declines in our cash walk-in business in the U.S., but pretty similar components of growth as we see in the last few quarters.", "Alex Veytsman", "And then on the B2B side also some acceleration I think from 7% to 9%. Is it pretty much the same landscape as before?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "As the business continues to execute that's the fourth quarter in a row that we've had good constant currency growth acceleration. They're focusing on driving continued expansion of our hedging and risk management capabilities as well as driving growth in our integrated payments vertical. So university payments, financial institutions, NGOs, these are typically more sticky relationships. They require a little bit of more of an integrated solution and we've been quite successful and we continue to expand that into more markets.", "Alex Veytsman", "Great. Thank you. Thank you, Salop.", "Rajesh Agrawal", "Thanks, Allen.", "Michael Salop", "I think we have one more person in the queue. So we'll take the final question.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Matthew O'Neill of Autonomous.", "Matthew O\u2019Neill", "Good evening. Most of my questions have been answered. But just wanted to get an update on the [ph] 12/2015 pricing that you discussed taking in from geographies in the U.S. and any important dates there, another three months into that?", "Rajesh Agrawal", "So our pricing actions where we put in place in 2015 are working, and we've been seeing good response to our pricing action, but they're really corridor and corridor specific. The pricing actions we put in the U.S. is in the higher band and we see the early transaction growth, it will take some time until you need some core quarters to understand really the response on the pricing actions but we see early signs of good transaction growth, on the higher bands. Other than that, we did some - the usual pricing actions quarter-by-quarter and country-by-country, but it's not that big and the current business model is pretty much working and we are satisfied with that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I mean, we didn't price very much of the higher bands. And if you recall, it was 25% of the above $200 principal band, which half of the business roughly is below $200 and half is above. And we only price 25% of the above - about $200 principal bands. So, relatively small amount of the business that was priced, and we're seeing good results as Hikmet said.", "Matthew O\u2019Neill", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Hey, thanks.", "Matthew O\u2019Neill", "Thanks, everyone.", "Michael Salop", "Thanks, everyone.

My name is Jonathan, and I'm your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to hand the call off to Mr. Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed, sir.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, we will have comments from Hikmet Ersek, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call.

Other than the replay, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone. Before I discuss the third quarter 2011 results, I would like to take a moment and make a comment regarding the devastating earthquake that struck 3 days ago in my home country, Turkey. Western Union expresses the deepest condolences to the families of the people who died and we wish all the best to those who are injured. To support recovery efforts, the Western Union Foundation is assisting the Turkish Red Crescent and we are also temporarily eliminating transfer fees for certain quarters in affected areas in East Anatolia so our consumers can support their loved ones. ", "Now turning back to our results. Our business continues to be resilient, with solid consumer-to-consumer trends overall improved in consumer bill payments and a very strong quarter from Western Union Business Solutions. Total revenue increased 6% or 5% on a constant currency basis. As you are all aware, there are a lot of turbulences in the markets in the third quarter, and certainly we are seeing economic challenges in some parts of the world. However, our consumers are loyal, our business is diversified and we remain on track to achieve the full year outlook for revenue that we provided in July. So we have moved our EPS outlook to be at the higher end of our previous range. ", "In the consumer-to-consumer segment, our geographic diversity and ability to react quickly to changing conditions allowed us to deliver solid results in the quarter. Trends moderated slightly from the second quarter as there was some slowdown in Southern Europe and Russia. However, steady results from the U.S. and the large markets in Europe as well as strength in Mexico led to 4% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, reported revenue in C2C increased 6% and was aided by a stronger euro. I was pleased with my tour in Mexico last week and still see opportunity to grow our business there. ", "In the U.S., domestic money transfer continued its strong momentum, with revenue growth of 9% and transaction growth of 14%. Globally, our pricing remained steady and we now project declines of only 1% for the full year. I also just recently returned from a market tour of Europe and Russia. Despite the negative financial headlines in Europe, our business is holding up. We have strong agent relationships and loyal consumers in the region and our brand is well positioned. There are some competitive challenges from the local players in Russia as we need to develop a retail network to complement our bank/agent locations, but we have good action plans in place. ", "We also continued to extend our network around the world in the quarter, adding another 15,000 agent locations, which brings our total to 485,000 locations. The growth rate in Global Business Payments improved in the quarter, with 7% revenue growth driven by a very strong quarter from Western Union Business Solutions and consistent trends in the consumer bill payment business. ", "In consumer bill payment, we reported revenue growth of 2%, the second consecutive quarter of positive growth, led by our South American business and steady trends in the U.S. We recently rolled out our enhanced walk-in service across the U.S. and launched a national media promotion to make consumers aware of this convenient service with connections to over 10,000 dealers. ", "Western Business Solutions delivered 30% revenue growth in the quarter with strong performance across key markets including Canada, the U.S. and Australia. Currency volatility most likely spurred more SME transactions and there was also some currency translation benefit, but there are still strong results and we are on track for a very good growth year in Business Solutions. ", "As we speak, there are many activities across the globe to capitalize on the business-to-business opportunity. We have signed additional Western Union Money Transfer agents who will now also sell the business-to-business service in certain markets with the Philippines already going alive. Online and mobile FX payments capabilities are now available for SMEs in the market such as France, Germany, Ireland and Italy. ", "And finally, we are on track to close the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition in the fourth quarter following the receipt of all regulatory approvals. The business has been performing to our acquisition expectations since we signed the agreement and we have been diligently planning the integration. We are looking forward to combining this business with Western Union Business Solutions, leveraging the many capabilities and assets of each to drive business-to-business growth for many years to come. ", "Let me now update you on some of our other strategic initiatives. In electronic channels which include westernunion.com, electronic account-based money transfer and mobile money transfer, revenue increased 40% in the quarter and it represented 3% of total company revenue. Our account-based money transfer transaction which includes Cash-to-Account, Account-to-Cash for banks, increased almost 40% in the quarter. We now have over 70 banks signed to offer account-based money transfer service with 35 active. We recently added account-based money transfer with La Banque Postale in France, which is one of our major European agents. Another electronic challenge for money transfer is through ATMs and we now have money transfer service available through over 30,000 ATMs with various banks across Europe and Asia. ", "westernunion.com, on the other side, have transaction growth of 30%, with transaction growth in international markets of 45%. In stored value, our prepaid cards-in-force in the U.S. now total over 1.2 million with retail distribution at nearly 13,000 locations. In the third quarter, approximately $120 million of principal was loaded onto Western Union prepaid cards through 500,000 loads. We recently announced that our prepaid cards will be available at several thousands 7-Eleven locations in the U.S. in early 2012, which will significantly expand our distribution base. We will also be piloting prepaid card programs in the U.K. and the Philippines over the coming months. Our differentiation in prepaid remains our brand, our relationship with underserved consumers, our global agent network and our consumer-friendly fee structure and we believe, over time, we will be able to leverage these assets and develop this market opportunity to organic growth. ", "The company continues to generate strong cash flow, with year-to-date cash flow from operations over $880 million through September. In 2011, we are deploying approximately $1.3 billion of capital for the Travelex Global Business Payments, Angelo Costa and Finint acquisitions. These transactions will help spur further growth and efficiencies in key strategic areas. We are also actively returning funds to shareholders. Through the third quarter, we have repurchased $800 million of our shares, which represent 6% of shares outstanding and declared $145 million of dividend. Given the strong allocation of capital year-to-date and our capital structure targets, we do not anticipate purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter. We will have the flexibility to resume repurchase programs soon in 2012. ", "The Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition, in combination with our existing Western Union Business Solutions, will give us all the assets we need to capitalize on the business-to-business opportunity. While we may continue to make a cautious smaller acquisition that support our growth strategies, at this time, I do not see us pursuing any sizable acquisitions. ", "Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to take a moment to discuss the new business unit structure we announced during the quarter. To align with and drive our key growth priorities, we now have in place 3 primary business units. Most of our revenue today is in the Global Consumer Financial Services unit led by Stewart Stockdale, who is the President of this business. The unit includes our consumer money transfer service and consumer bill payments. This is the heart of the company today and includes our agent network and go-to-market actions for consumer products and services. We also created a separate unit for business-to-business payments, which includes Western Union Business Solutions and will at the Travelex Global Business Payments operations after the acquisition is completed. This unit is led by Roger Raj Agrawal, who has been named President of Western Union Business Solutions. We believe there is a huge market opportunity for served and underserved SMEs with their cost for the payment needs and having a dedicated business unit and executive team will ensure that we execute against the opportunity. ", "Our third unit is Western Union Ventures. This is a newly created unit led by our Chief Marketing Officer, Diane Scott, who is now also President of Western Union Ventures. This unit will focus on leveraging the company's existing assets such us global brand, our agent network and our extensive customer relationship with the underserved to introduce new products and services. We want to deepen relationship and share of wallet with the existing consumer, but also add new consumers over time. Westernunion.com stored-value prepaid and mobile money transfer are in Ventures. But long-term intent is to develop new services for the untapped, underserved customers as well. ", "As you know, we are constantly looking to improve our business to grow faster. Over the past several months, we have assembled 2 project teams, one in Denver and another one in San Francisco, consisting of some of our best people and represented diverse functions from across the globe. The teams had been out to create the roadmap for making Western Union a truly consumer-centric organization by accelerating growth in our consumer business and building a plan to significantly grow and enhance westernunion.com. ", "While these efforts are still in progress, I can truly say I am energized and excited from what I have seen. We will share ", "[Audio Gap] ", "They will take some time and afford to implement, but there are great opportunities to optimize the customer experience, accelerate our share gains around the globe and elevate westernunion.com to become a truly meaningful channel. ", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the quarter and our full year outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. Overall for the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 6% on a reported basis or 5% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation added approximately $18 million to GAAP revenues in the quarter, primarily due to continued strengthening in European currencies. The consolidated revenue growth was driven by continued solid trends in our consumer-to-consumer segment and strong growth in Western Union Business Solutions. In addition, our consumer bill payments business delivered positive revenue growth. Transaction fee revenue increased 5%, while foreign exchange revenue grew 12% due to C2C cross-border principal growth and strong revenue from Western Union Business Solutions. Within C2C, revenue increased 6% with transaction fee revenue up 5% and foreign exchange revenue up 9%. C2C foreign exchange revenue was primarily driven by growth in cross-border principal, which increased 8% in the quarter. ", "In the consumer-to-consumer segment, reported revenue increased 6%. The constant currency revenue growth in C2C was 4% compared with 5% last quarter, while transaction growth was 5%, down slightly from the second quarter. The transaction growth slowdown was mainly due to challenging comparisons in U.S. domestic money transfer, and slowness in Russia and parts of Southern Europe, partially offset by improvement in Mexico and the reopening of the Ivory Coast business. The company's C2C cross-border principle increased 8% or 5% on constant currency basis. We are confident we are gaining share again in 2011. C2C principal per transaction increased 3% year-over-year and was flat on a constant currency basis. In the international C2C business, revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. International transaction growth was 4%. International constant currency principal per transaction increased 1% compared to the prior year, which marked the fourth consecutive quarterly increase. Including the impact of currency, international principal per transaction increased 4% in the quarter. ", "Turning to the regions. Our C2C business in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew revenue at 5% on transaction growth of 3%. The transaction growth rate was down slightly from the second quarter, with revenue trends moderated due to currency and some slowness in Southern Europe and Russia. Other larger markets in Europe such as the U.K., France and Germany, remained consistent with second quarter trends as did the Gulf States. In India, trends increased with 13% revenue growth and 11% transaction growth. The Ivory Coast business was operating throughout the quarter, which modestly aided EMEASA trends. Some agents in Libya reopened but activity was light in the quarter. ", "Turning to the Americas region. Revenue increased 6% on transaction growth of 6%. Domestic money transfer continues to have strong momentum, with revenue growth of 9% on transaction growth of 14% in the quarter. Mexico trends also improved in the quarter, revenue increased 5%, which we believe was partially driven by consumers sending more funds when the Mexican peso depreciated. Mexico transactions increased by 2%. We're still testing $5 for $50 and other price changes for the U.S. to Mexico corridor, including increases in higher bands. So far we have seen some transaction lift, but the revenue impact has been fairly neutral. ", "U.S. outbound growth remained consistent with the second quarter. Asia-Pacific revenue continued to increase in double digits, with the third quarter at 11% growth. Asia-Pacific transactions increased 7%. Australia and the Philippines delivered good growth although not as strong as the second quarter, which contributed to this lower revenue and transaction growth for the quarter. ", "In China, revenue grew 5% in the quarter, while transactions increased 4%. China revenue growth was not as strong as the second quarter, which we believe was partially impacted by consumer reaction to the strength of the Chinese currency relative to some key Zen markets. ", "For the overall C2C business, the spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter remained at 1 percentage point, excluding the impact of currency, which had a 2-point benefit. The impact of pricing was 1%, while mix was neutral again in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect price decreases to be 1% rather than our previous estimate of 1% to 2%. ", "Moving to Global Business Payments. The overall segment revenue increased 7%. The consumer bill payment business continued its improvement with revenue increasing 2%, led by a strong international growth. U.S. trends were consistent with the second quarter. Western Union Business Solutions reported strong revenue growth of 30%. Currency volatility during the third quarter most likely prompted many SMEs to complete transactions, and currency translation added about 8 points of growth. Overall, we are on track for high teens revenue growth in B2B this year. ", "Turning to margins. The third quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 25.7%, which compares to 26.4% in 2010. Excluding restructuring charges, the consolidated operating margin was 26.7% in this year's third quarter compared to 27.5% in the prior year. Currency translation aided revenue by approximately $18 million, but negatively impacted operating margins. As a reminder, the strengthening of European currencies favorably impacts revenue, but has a less significant impact on operating profits due to the company's hedging programs. The third quarter operating margin excluding restructuring expenses declined by approximately 80 basis points from the same period last year due to the impact of currency translation and higher marketing spending and $5 million of Travelex Global Business Payments deal cost. On a constant currency basis, margins would have increased as restructuring savings and revenue leverage offset higher marketing spending and deal costs. Marketing expenses were 4.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.7% in 2010. We recorded $14 million of restructuring expenses in the quarter related to our previously announced programs. Approximately $3 million of the expenses included in cost of services and $11 million is in SG&A. This compares to $14 million in restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2010. These charges are not included in our segment operating results. The company recorded a total of $47 million of restructuring charges in 2011. As of the end of the third quarter, all restructuring actions related to these previously announced programs have been completed and all related restructuring expenses have been recorded. We now expect approximately $55 million of related savings for the year and $70 million in 2012. We realized $17 million of savings from restructuring activities in the quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 23.6% or 23.9%, excluding the impact of the restructuring charges, which compares to 22.7% or 23.2%, excluding restructuring charges in the third quarter of last year. Our full year estimated tax rate continues to be in the range of 23% to 24%. ", "Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.38 or $0.40 excluding restructuring charges. GAAP EPS was $0.36 in the third quarter of last year or $0.37 excluding restructuring charges. Our C2C segment operating margin in the quarter was 29.0% compared to 29.9% in the same period last year. The decrease was due to the impact of currency and higher marketing spending, which offset other efficiencies including restructuring savings and revenue leverage. Global Business Payments' operating margin was 17.7% in the quarter which compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of 2010. The margin improved compared to last year primarily due to revenue increases, restructuring savings and lower integration investment spending in Western Union Business Solutions. We continue to expect Western Union Business Solutions to be non-dilutive to earnings for the full year. ", "Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $883 million and capital expenditures were $124 million. Our year-to-date depreciation and amortization was approximately $137 million. Capital spending has been approximately 3% of revenues year-to-date which is the level we expect for the year. At quarter-end, the company had total debt of $4 billion and cash of $2.7 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion was outside the United States. As a reminder, we have $700 million in notes maturing in November of this year. During the third quarter, we issued $400 million of 7-year senior notes at a rate of 3.65%. These proceeds, combined with the $300 million we issued in the first quarter, provided us the cash to retire the maturing notes in the fourth quarter. In addition, we entered into a $1.65 billion credit facility during the quarter, which expires in 2017 and currently remains undrawn. This replaces the previous facility which was due to expire in 2012. ", "In the third quarter, we spent $140 million to repurchase 9 million shares or 1% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $16.18. As of September 30, our shares outstanding were 619 million shares. We also declared $50 million in quarterly dividends which were paid on October 7. We managed our capital structure to balance the relationship among returns and cost of capital considering the mix of debt relative to earnings, cash levels and the alternative uses of cash among other items. As Hikmet mentioned, we ", "[Audio Gap]", "repurchase -- as Hikmet mentioned, we anticipate that the $800 million of share repurchases through third quarter will complete our buyback program for the year. As we enter 2012, a new year of cash flow generation will give us the flexibility to resume an active repurchase program. We have $615 million remaining under our existing authorization which expires at the end of 2012. We believe managing and balancing our capital structure in this manner gives us the most flexibility in running our business, although we do periodically revisit our optimal capital structures with our Board. ", "Turning to our expectations for the full year. We are affirming our outlook provided on July 26 for revenue and moving our earnings per share outlook to the higher end of the previous range. Our revenue outlook calls for constant currency revenue growth in a range of 4% to 5%, and GAAP revenue growth 1% higher than constant currency. Our outlook does not include any revenues from the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. For earnings per share, the outlook is GAAP EPS in a range of $1.50 to $1.53 which compares to $1.48 to $1.53 in our July outlook; and EPS excluding restructuring charges of $1.55 to $1.58 which compares to our July outlook of $1.53 to $1.58. These EPS ranges include a negative $0.02 impact from deal costs associated with the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition. ", "Our operating margin outlook is consistent with our July outlook as follows: GAAP operating margin continues to be in a range of 25% to 25.5%, including Travelex deal costs. Operating margins excluding restructuring charges are projected at a range of 26% to 26.5%. On a constant currency basis, operating margins excluding restructuring charges are projected at 26.5% to 27%, including Travelex deal cost. This compares to an operating margin excluding restructuring charges of 26.2% in 2010. We are still projecting full year marketing expenses similar to last year at approximately 4% of revenue. We continue to expect GAAP cash flows from operating activities to be close to the lower ", "[Audio Gap] ", "the year. ", "In summary, we are pleased with the results we delivered in spite of challenging conditions in some parts of the world and are comfortable with our outlook for the year. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question is coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I'm going to start with a question actually on the U.S. and specifically the bank distribution channel. I know that you've had some nice success signing up some new banks. You talked about regions the last quarter and I think you added KeyBank as well, if I'm not mistaken, and I wanted to get an update on what percent every U.S. agent network is now banks and where that might go over time. And is there any material difference in the number of transactions or principal per transaction that you guys see through the bank agent channel in the U.S. compared with your non-bank agents? And I'm just trying to get an overall sense if this bank channel is part of what's contributing to the domestic strength in your business.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. I think it's a huge opportunity, Jason, for the future of that. It's too early to carve it out as -- on retail but -- on channel but we see new customer segments. We see customers we didn't touch in the past, account holders using our service. We have now about 5 banks in the U.S. which do serve our service. As you recall, we had the U.S. Bank, Regions Bank, we had Alaska bank, Sberbank, and these banks do diversify our channels. As you know we had that in Europe, most of our European agents are the banks, now we are going there to retail and now what we do in the U.S. is we had to retail network we go to diversify our customer base also to U.S. banks. I think it's also a huge opportunity for the banks because they do -- besides the money transfer transaction, they have traffic to their location, they attract new customers, they cross sell with their products. I think it's a win-win situation with the -- our agents also.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So is the principal per transaction typically higher with the banks or is there no real appreciable difference?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Jason, it varies from bank to bank, so the customer segment is a little bit different, as Hikmet mentioned, but from bank to bank it varies. But in the U.S., the team has done a nice job of adding banks but it's a small part of our distribution in the U.S. compared to globally and we still see a lot of opportunities to continue to add banks as we move forward.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's good to know. And just a question on the guidance. I know that the revenue and the margin outlook is unchanged for 2011, but you did nudge the EPS up to the higher end. Is that simply because of the buybacks that you've been doing or any other nuances kind of below the operating margin line we should be aware of? It sounded like your tax rate outlook is also not changing here.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Jason, I'd say as much as anything, it's just our confidence in the business as we move forward. We've got 3 quarters under our belt. There's about 9 or 10 weeks left in the fourth quarter, so just confident in the business and where we're heading. And so we moved the EPS to the higher end of the range than we had in July.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just last one for me, just to clarify on the restructuring, I know that you guys said that the program that have been announced in 2010 is now fully completed, which is great to see. So is it fair to say that we should not be expecting any more restructuring costs in 2012, at least nothing that would be big enough magnitude to actually call out?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I take the first part. I think we are, first of all, we are constantly looking at our organization, constant looking to improve our organization, adapting to the market. I would never say that in any restructuring ever, this organization restructuring never stops, right? I think we did our job very well into the 2010. And in 2011, I think we are on track with our numbers here. And we did some really good achievements here. But we will give you more guidance in 2012, for 2012 on our February earnings release and we will give you more direction there, Jason.", "Michael A. Salop", "And Jason, we will have the Travelex integration expenses next year. We will call those out for you as we get through the year.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First question, just on the pricing side, I think there was a comment said that the expectation for pricing is about 1% versus your more typical 1% or 2% or it's been even 3% in the past pressure, which is a good thing to see. I mean, 1%, I'm assuming is still somewhat -- is there still some of that coming from the U.S. change that occurred earlier in the year or still dragged on earlier in the year? Is there other things going on? And why is it less now? Is there anything sort of fundamental going on in the industry?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I wouldn't say it's something fundamental going on there on in the industry. I -- our pricing investments changes from quarter-to-quarter, from year to year. Currently what we say is, we are very well positioned with our 485,000 locations, our brands, our consumers like us despite the economical challenges, they keep with us. So I think that 1% investment, pricing investment, is the direction for this year. In the -- if you look at our pricing that you have mentioned it's 1% to 3% deposit, it gives us the flexibility depending on how we operate in the 16,000 corridors. It gives us the flexibility to gain market share and to grow -- to have the long-term growth.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. Another question just on the margin, if you don't mind. The operating margin came in pretty strong. I mean sequentially it was up a bit, and then -- but it looks like it was more from the continued success in your Global Business Payments segment in growth there. It looked like the bill bay is still growing, obviously it helps the margin. Just when you think about the C2C margins for a moment, I mean you had revenue growth of 4% on a constant currency basis, and yet your margin year-over-year was obviously not up in that segment. I know advertising, correct me if I'm wrong, advertising may have been up a little bit. I don't know if that drove some of that, but we still expect this to be a fixed cost auto with operating leverage, so should we continue to expect that to be materially evident and going forward in margins if this business does keep growing that we'll see that opportunity?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. How I think about -- Darrin, how I think about margins on a long-term basis, then I'll come back to the quarter here, too. But on a long-term basis, that our goal, as a management team over the long-term is to grow the margins. And to your point, we believe the business models are set up to grow margins on a long-term basis on any given year or any given quarter, it will depend upon the revenue growth, what the productivity savings might look like and then the levels of investments that we make in the business. And to that, when you focus just say on the third quarter, a couple of the things that's impacting the margin in C2C business, still very strong at 29% but compared to the prior year, we did invest more in marketing, on a consolidated basis, we're about 4.5% of revenue compared to 3.7% a year ago. So not quite 100 basis points, but quite a bit of it there. And then currency, although currency helped the top line on a consolidated basis and in the C2C division, it did not have as much of an impact on the bottom line. So if you take out currency, and if you factor in the marketing impact, the C2C margins are still very strong in the third quarter.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. Just last quick question for me and I'll go back to the queue. And in Europe, I mean, I know things have been pretty resilient and holding up well, but can you just give us a little more color? Have you seen any evidence of anything slower or changing given the macro backdrop?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. Well, Darrin, I mean obviously there's no secret that Europe has an issue, right? Economic issues and the finance crisis and debt issues, everything is going on. But our business has been -- especially in countries like U.K., France, and Germany, quite holding quite good, right? We do see some softness in Southern Europe. We do see a little bit challenges in Russia but generally, I would say I'm pleased with the European results. And the transaction and the revenue has been holding in this major countries pretty well. That shows also that's the beauty of our business molding and so many countries we really diversify our opportunities and also managed to risk against the risk areas, right?", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin T Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just to follow on to Darrin's questions, just in terms of the softness you're seeing in Southern Europe, did it get depressingly worse month-to-month? And I'm curious how you define softness? Is it -- are you seeing lower principal per transaction or is it just pure transactions? I'm curious if you give a little bit more flavor on that.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Tien-Tsin, let me first broadly talk about Europe and then drill down into Southern Europe, which is a much smaller piece of Europe, if you will, but Europe continued to grow. In fact, it was only down about 1 point of growth from Q3 compared to Q2. And if you back out Southern Europe, Europe in itself without Southern Europe, had the same growth rate, Q3 and Q2. So continued to see strength in market such as the U.K., Germany and France. So Southern Europe, you got countries such as Spain with 20% unemployment clearly have had some challenges there. So quarter-over-quarter, there was a little bit more softness in Southern Europe, but not a tremendous amount.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And also, Scandinavia and Nordic countries are doing -- holding pretty well.", "Tien-Tsin T Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, understood. I mean, overall the Europe numbers are better than what we expected. I'm just curious if there's -- this is beginning of something to watch because it sounds like it's manageable. The other question I had, just I think you explained the Mexico strength to the peso depreciation. I'm curious, does stronger dollar or weaker euro globally have any real impact on demand? I'm wondering if that's something we should be mindful of now given the FX trends.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, depending on the business-to-business solutions it does obviously have on the business model effect. But on the consumer business, it depends really on the corridor. It depends really on the countries. In some corridors, these payout in local currency and some corridors, we payout in euro and in dollar. So I wouldn't see from the consumer behavior any changes. The consumer really send home what they earn. They really -- they don't hold it so much back. We saw a little bit on Mexico, that changes a little bit. But I wouldn't build a general model out of that, Tien-Tsin.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "A lot of times when it happens, it's just a movement from one time period to another, so somebody might expedite a $0.01 or [indiscernible] because of the currency movement. So from a long-term perspective, it's not really a change in behavior.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On prepaid, you said the past international's an attractive proposition and I get your message on no acquisition, large acquisitions near term, but once we get past Travelex integration and beyond that, can you talk about your international prepaid strategy, and if it's biased towards partnering, acquiring or a mix of both? And is there any sort of aspect to the value chain where you'll be focused, such as the whole ball of wax program management or distribution only, reloads so on and so forth?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. First of all, I think we would like to grow the business -- prepaid business, organic. The reason for that is we already have some fundamentals here. We have the branch, plus we have the distribution channels with our agents and we do have the regulatory environment like in the Europe, the European license with the banks and that will give us the issuing credibility, also holding funds, right, Scott, in the -- in our Western Union bank. So that's -- these fundamentals will expand our prepaid strategy. Now again, coming to the prepaid strategy, we believe that our next market within the next months will be U.K. and Philippines for our test expanding that. Don't forget, though, in prepaid, every country has their own specific customer needs, consumer needs, so we have to adapt to programs to the consumer needs. But I am very optimistic that we will be very successful with our prepaid strategy long time -- long-term.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Just one more on prepaid and I'll wrap it up. I thought the recent signing with 7-Eleven was very good. But I just want to step back and get a sense of when you think about competing with your competitors out there and think about the main decision engines for a consumer when he's presented with multiple cards at a j-hook, such as he will be at 7-Eleven with yours versus Green Dot and multiple prepaid cards, what do you think is going to drive his decision and why should we think it's anything other than price?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I -- first of all, obviously, Glenn, you said that from consumer friendliness, fee friendliness does help to make the decision for us. But don't underestimate our model is a little bit different than the others. We do have the customer relationship to our brand. We do right on our brand. We advertise our brand and the prepaid product is really one of the major products to keep the customer long-term in our network, in our brands.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Real quickly, you guys touched on some of the things that you guys have been working on with regards to the Travelex acquisition. I'm curious on what you guys have learned in terms of incremental opportunities on Travelex, sort of weighing revenue growth opportunities versus cost synergies. Where are you guys in terms of thinking of where the upside in terms of contribution, good compromise as you move to 2012 with Travelex?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well I am very excited and motivated about -- as you can tell, Julio, about the acquisition. I'm putting this together at the integration. First of all, the deal has not been closed yet officially. We assume that the next few -- within the next few months, we will have closed the deal. The regulatory approvals are coming one after the other. And I'm very optimistic to close this deal as soon as possible. And the next focus will be the integration and will give us the global footprint. I think one of the most strengths of Travelex is the sales force they have on their team. They are very good on getting new customers, getting new accounts. They also have the financial institutions as customers; that will also expand to our new portfolio. Seeing that also, I mean, don't forget the existing business solutions. Now after we focus the first 6 months, really delivers good numbers also. Combining their operations with our operations, I believe that's about $400 million in 2012. It will give us a very strong leg to expand the Western Union brand also to new customer segment, which is the SMEs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then maybe just switching over to Scott on the margin expectations for the fourth quarter, if you can break out your expectations for Business Solutions relative to the C2C side, anything in particular we should be thinking about for -- from an expense perspective as we think about individual margin modeling here for the segment?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure, sure. Just to start on Business Solutions, we do expect that business to be non-dilutive to earnings. On Global Business Payments, that division, you did see margins of -- very strong compared to the quarter from a year ago and continued to expect to have improvements in those margins as we move forward in Global Business Payments. We think we're doing the right things there. And then to talk about C2C, Julio, or maybe just to take it back to the consolidated level for the business in that on a full year basis, our outlook from July to today is not too different. We do expect margins, exclude restructuring charges and also exclude the impact of currency. The margins will be somewhere between 26.5% to 27%, which would be up compared to the 26.2% in 2010, excluding restructuring expenses. Now last quarter, we did comment on how we saw the margins among Q3 and Q4. We did spend more marketing in Q3 as we anticipated, but not quite as much as we thought 90 days ago. And some of the deal expenses for Travelex will shift into Q4. So overall, we're on track to hit our margins for the full year and really reconfirming the margin guidance we had back in July, maybe a little bit of timing among the quarters, but back to hitting those margins as we contemplated in July.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, going back to the decision to hold off on the buybacks for the rest of the year, when you look at the stock at 10x free cash flow yields of about 10% or so. What was the logic for not continuing the buybacks into the rest of this year other than just sort of feeling like you guys had done your part? But when you look at where the stock is right now, it seems like you guys can still be pretty accretive on the buyback side. Could you just walk us through maybe some of your thinking there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Actually if you step back, Julio, a little bit, you will see that the repurchase of about $800 million in total year and we also -- it's almost 6% of our outstanding shares, right, Scott? I mean we repurchased here and plus we paid about $145 million of dividend. So given the financial environment, I think that's pretty well numbered. And plus given our cash flow, we also deployed about $1.3 billion on the acquisitions on Finint, Costa and Travelex which is also for future growth. I think if you look at that plus we are quarter-by-quarter having pretty good results, I think within that environment, we've been -- we are very good, have a good balance here between repurchase, dividends and also hitting the numbers.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "The only thing I'd add, Julio, we still have a lot of confidence in the business and in the long-term growth of the company. We are trying to balance cash levels with earnings with debt levels and all those things. And just balancing all those things and we did buyback $800 million of stock, which is 6%. And as we turn the page on the calendar to January, we'll have the flexibility to continue to buy back stock and this is the type of business that generates $1 billion-plus of cash flow from operations.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So that the rest of the buyback starts again in 2012 and I think you said it was $600 million or so left?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, we have about $600 million left on the authorization. We clearly have the flexibility to start that back up in 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Scott, I wanted to go back to a comment you made on marketing spend. I think you said you anticipate spending 4.5% and I'm wondering, is that a new level of spending? Or as you look over the next couple of years, we have to spend more on marketing because of the new businesses and maybe the Western Union Ventures program as well?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, maybe I should have clarified it a little bit, too, Kartik, that in the third quarter, we spent about 4.5% of our revenue on marketing compared to the third quarter of a year ago. Third quarter of a year ago was about 3.7%. On a full year basis, we still anticipate spending about 4% of our top line on marketing. There is some variation quarter-by-quarter which has some impact on the margins and so forth. But overall, 4% where we've been in 2011, 2010, that feels about at the right level now. It could vary little bit year-by-year but directionally, I would call it out at 4%.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And Hikmet, you've had good success using these pricing bands in the U.S. I know Mexico is a little too early to determine how much success you'll have or not have, but is there an opportunity to use this in other corridors? And could that benefit the company and maybe spur some growth?", "Hikmet Ersek", "If you look at our business, we've been doing that for -- in many corridors already actually, right? But $5 for $50 in the U.S. is probably our biggest price investment ever we did and by the way, it's not only $5 for $50, as you know, Kartik, it's also changing in the other bands and so even in some bands, we increase the pricing here. So we did promote the $5 for $50 in the business in the U.S. and we were very successful. We did also some in U.K. to promote that, we had some successes there. We are really looking market by market and in some countries given this current currency, it doesn't sound $5 for $50 we're well aware that different currencies may be $10 for $100, right? So we use it as a promotion. We use it as attracting customers, gaining market share and increasing our revenue long-term, yes, the short answer is, yes, we do it, but given our pricing investment, and this year we have about, as you heard before, we had about 1% pricing investment.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then just a last question on PSD, how much revenue has PSD generated in 2011 and kind of where it is in terms of your expectations so far for the year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I'm very pleased with the PSD actions. I mean we have -- we always said it's going to be 1% additional incremental revenue to this retail locations which we are on track and we are hitting the numbers, 1% incremental revenue. And I'm pleased with -- and also not I'm only pleased, the customers are pleased because they are using it and they like it with the longer opening hours and fantastic locations, I think we have been having good results on PSD.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on the pricing question. I guess it's interesting that it's only going to be 1% this year. Is it just a factor that there's just not other corridors that it makes sense to drop price to drive transactions? Because typically over the history I've covered the company, it's hovered more 2% to 3%. It's just kind of interesting it's down to 1%, so maybe there isn't as many opportunities this year as there has been in the past. I just want to get your thoughts there.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think, first of all, we do price investment, Bryan. I mean, we look corridor by corridor. As you recall, last year the biggest price investment corridor the U.S. impacted our pricing generally on the investment. But we do also sometimes FX increasement and increasement also in the pricing. We would like to keep this flexibility between about the historical flexibility, which we had to invest in the right momentum, the right pricing. But currently, I would say that we are very comfortable with our 1% and also with our revenue guidance. And obviously the global reach, strong brand, agent relationship helps that consumer likes them -- stick with us.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And let me just about ask about 2 countries. One, maybe you could just talk about Ivory Coast. It sounds like is that fully operational and how much should that help the numbers? And then second on Russia. It sounds like there were some competition in the retail market, and then you guys had a strategy to combat that. I'd just be interested in that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, we are operational in Ivory Coast. It's helping us to drive also the revenue which we had some, I think it was Q2, Q1, Q2, we had some issues, right?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Ivory Coast is up and running, so it's helpful to the Q3 trends.", "Hikmet Ersek", "On Russia, I just recently came back. In Russia, we have about 17,000 locations with Sberbank, with post office, with all the banks. Mainly it's the financial services end. No one has 70,000 locations as we do have. We cover the country. However, they are all financial institutions. Russia recently announced that they will also get the kind of a PSD opening to retail network. They are also for money transfer and other financial services and we would like to be there also and that's the plan to expand, like the PSD we did in Europe, also in Russia, expanding the retail network there.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the weakness in Russia was because there was some competition in the retail area, or was it more an economic issue?", "Hikmet Ersek", "There are some local players, especially to Russia to Central Asia corridors. And the local players have been doing some actions there and that has impacted a little bit our business. And also, we feel a little bit on the economic environment here, there is a little bit cold outside there.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess my first question is on B2B, the revenue growth seems to have accelerated sequentially and I know you mentioned currency, but were there any other factors? Have you changed anything? Is this the investments paying off that you see in the business? What's going on there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "First of all currency, we mentioned that, but also the team is doing a good job. After the customers re-branded the Western Union Business Solutions, we have dedicated team going up to sales approaches. I think the team is doing good, great. We have businesses which they -- they are loyal to us, right? So once they've signed with us, once they enjoy our service, they stick with us and they stay with us and they are loyal, so that helps also. And that has been a very good quarter and depending on the quarter, but we believe that we are on the right track to have high-teens year. And Raj Agrawal and the team is doing a good job on that; that's we why also created his own business unit. And with the Travelex acquisition and combining this, too, I think we can have a very strong second leg for the future.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess a second question probably for Scott here. The SG&A growth being faster than revenue growth, how much of that is onetime in nature with deal cost and restructuring-type stuff versus discretionary marketing investments that you're doing? And if you could get into some detail on the kind of marketing investments and what you expect from them.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure. Ashwin, the first part of your question kind of broke up. Could you repeat your question? Sorry, about that. It kind of broke up coming through our on end.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure. Yes, so the question was around the rate of growth of SG&A relative to rate of growth of revenues. And what part of the differential is sort of explained by onetime factors such as deal costs and restructuring versus marketing impact that could be discretionary? And then second part was what are you spending the marketing dollars on? Is it more agent? Is it specific things you're doing that are seasonal in nature?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. On the SG&A, and let me just give you a couple of numbers it might help us think about it, too. But in the third quarter if you strip out restructuring charges, SG&A ran about in 16.8%. If you compare that to third quarter a year ago, it was about 16.3%. Clearly, we had deal costs of $5 million that's driving up that line in the third quarter of '11. But also the timing of the marketing where we spent about 4.5% of our revenues on marketing in the third quarter compared to 3.7%. So the timing of the investment spending still on track for the full year margins. As we think about marketing, what's great about our business is we're in 16,000 corridors, 200 countries, so the campaigns can really vary anywhere from national media campaigns, radio, all the way to grassroots events in local villages in India and they kind of run in between all that. And so in the third quarter, we saw some opportunities to spend and invest and we did that, and we think that will aid the top line growth as we move forward too.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Tom McCrohan with Janney Capital Markets.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I just have 2 questions, one on prepaid and one on Mexico. On the prepaid, what is the cost to buy the prepaid card through the 7-Eleven retail channel?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "It will -- it's going to vary but generally, when you first buy the card, you've got to pay a $4.95 fee to reload the card at that time. And then as you subsequently reload it at retail, the $4.95 fee or if you get a direct deposit straight out of your bank account, there's no fee from that. And really the consumer proposition for us is having a strong brand and then also positioning it as a fee-friendly card in being able to, in the U.S., top up that card in almost any of the 50,000 locations in the U.S.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Will there be a fee, Scott, to buy the card?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "No, it will be included in that. That first -- when you first load the card, the $4.95 to load the card.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And the price, pricing, including the reload, is it different for 7-Eleven versus going to a Western Union location?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "No, it's pretty comparable at all the 13,000 locations that are selling our cards today.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just on the Mexico trends, if you can talk about October, given it seems like currency played a role in the quarter, in the pesos it just seems to have been kind of moving sideways since the end of the quarter. So I'm wondering if you've seen any moderation of trends in Mexico through today.", "Hikmet Ersek", "The currency, Tom, they definitely helped us. However, we are pleased with our Mexico numbers, with our position of our 3 brands actually, with our Western Union brand, Vigo brand and Orlando Valuta brand. We have pretty much covered the markets and are very well positioned. And I recently went to Mexico, last week actually. Our business is doing well, but I do still see opportunities to grow the business in Mexico. And the team is working hard to have that long-term success continued success in Mexico.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just on the trends in the quarter, did you see and I understand your guidance is pretty much in line on the top line with where you were, but as you went through the quarter, July, August, September, October, did you see -- have you seen slowdowns, has a slowdown accelerated through the quarter? Has it been pretty steady? How does October look relative to September? If you can give a little bit color on that and obviously, I mean the different markets are different, but...?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. You're absolutely right. Different markets are different and we did see strong in the U.S., Mexico business doing, as I mentioned before, pretty well. And also, our India business double-digit growth. Middle East is holding. We had this last year, of kind of Gulf issues. I think the Gulf States are quite good. We do see some softness in the southern part of Europe and parts of Russia as it impacted in the some -- in the end of Q2, Q3 a little bit. But generally, I would say I am pleased with our transaction growth and with the despite environment out there, our business is holding pretty well.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "You've been adding a lot of locations, you continue to add lot of locations. I mean the -- I guess, the revenue per location has been coming down. I mean, are you at a point where with close to 500,000 locations, are the -- what -- are the incremental locations essentially less? I mean incrementally profitable but less so than older locations? I mean, what types of locations have you generally been adding -- when you add 10,000 to 15,000 a quarter, so there's a lot of different types in there but are we incrementally getting less value add on the locations that you're adding on?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So, Bob, I think first of all, under my leadership, expansion of the location will continue. I believe that covered every corner with Western Union brand is essential to continue to drive the transaction and customer loyalty and revenues, that will continue. Most of the locations, though, we are adding are on the receive side, given the coverage on the rural areas of Asia or other parts of the world. But also I think PSD locations, a new class of traits like in Europe and in the U.S., the financial services, the banks will continue to add that. The team is doing great job. We are going after every opportunity here to expand our agent network, and together with that, our location network. Now I would not say that the productivity is going down because if you go to a stent location, you ask the question, can I send money to the rural area of Vietnam? The answer you'll get, \"Yes.\" With Western Union, you can do that because we have the locations, and that's going to go. So then on the send side, the productivity -- the other side, it increases even if you expand the location globally.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "The last question, you talked about more competition in Russia but are you seeing broadly around the world incrementally more competition than you have in the past from some upstarts? And we've heard of some new smaller players that are growing pretty rapidly with aggressive pricing. Are you seeing that more than in Russia? Are you seeing it in other methods of distribution besides retail, mobile, online?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Shortcut to your answer is that the competition is there, but we are gaining market share. And we are continuing to gaining market share, that puts us in a very good position. We do have competition quarter-by-quarter, country by country, but from the global perspective, we are very well positioned in gaining market share and especially in the cross-border money transfer business but also on the DMT with the U.S. what we did in the U.S. is a very well positioned. Our electronic channel is growing, like westernunion.com. International, for instance, growing by 45% or also our account-based money transfer, electronic money transfer is growing 30%. This will grow if you don't have the locations, if you don't have the network, if you don't have the brand, so I am very confident also that we are very well positioned to grow with our new channels, the electronic channels.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just kind of a big-picture question, Western Union would appear to have seen some nice organic revenue growth re-acceleration irrespective of a challenging global macro environment and, Hikmet, I think that's attributable to a lot of things you've done internally and some of the pricing changes and so forth. From here, if we look at marketing that's going to run for around 4% of revenue, if we look at a constant pace of new agent additions, what gets the growth kind of to the next level? I mean, is it cyclical at this point? How much do you control your own destiny vis-\u00e0-vis sort of the second derivative of your revenue growth?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So I don't have the fire alarm here, but I'm fired up with this business. But what I would say that is it's both, right? Obviously economic environment helps our business, drives a lot of job creation, drives a lot of the business and we do see some impact, as you know, in some parts of the world to our business. However, we are driving the business. What are we doing as a big picture is that we are diversifying our portfolio. We are reaching really to new customer segments with our electronic channels in the core business with DMT money transfer, with our price positioning in the U.S., reaching out to new customer segments with our SMEs, that will -- that brings Western Union to a growth area, which we would like to see. That's all our investments. That's all our focus to reaching into new customer segment. And keeping the existing loyal customers within the network which happens. That's the answer to a big question.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So in aggregate, given that you've had the success you had in a relatively short period of time, all else being equal, can 2013 -- or 2012, sorry, conceptually be, not asking you to give guidance, but conceptually be a better year for Western Union still than we saw in '11?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well generally, we always hope and aim to be every year is better than the other year, right? Obviously we work hard on that. But you know, we are -- really, we have a strategy as we outlined in the last September meeting. We will give more color in our strategy in February meeting. But as I said, with the 3 business lines we have it now, I think we are quite well positioned to gain further market share and be active, but economic environment definitely will also to help drive this business.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I wanted to ask, with regard to your marketing spend related to prepaid, could you give us some order of magnitude about how much of the marketing is being directed towards that product line?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "James, it's Scott. In each of our areas, whether it's B2B, C2C, Global Business Payments and prepaid, we are investing behind each of those business. Sometimes that means people, sometimes that means marketing, sometimes it's technology and so forth. So it's hard to specifically break out how much we're investing behind each initiative because it will vary by quarter and by year. But we are excited about the prepaid business. What we think globally, as Hikmet mentioned earlier in the call, with the strength of our brand, our distribution, the bank where we can issue the product, hundreds of millions of customers, we do believe prepaid is a nice long-term opportunity for Western Union.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Scott, if you wouldn't mind just revisiting Slide 16, I know there's been a lot of questions asked about the operating margin, but you actually went through some numbers in your prepared text. If I could ask you just to restate them to support the statement that on a constant currency basis operating margins increased, that will be really helpful.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure. If you look at the consolidated margins, as you think about Q3 and even on a full year basis that we will get benefit from top line, revenue from currency rates, so it'll be about $18 million in the third quarter. But because of our hedging programs and how those work, in some quarters we actually will have a small profit there even some quarters we would have a loss, if you will, just based on when the hedges were put in place. But the goal of the hedging program is to have long-term predictability of cash flow from that standpoint. So again, you can get a lot of -- when in the third quarter, $18 million on the top line, but it has much less or even potentially a small negative impact on profit which, when you take those back apples to apples, you would have a slight margin improvement on a currency basis.", "Michael A. Salop", "And James, if you want to go through that, you can call me later, there's a lot of -- it's a little bit complex on the nuances and we can walk through that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, thank you for all -- for your questions. I just wanted to recap the quarter once again. Despite some economic slowdown in parts of the world, our business is really holding up and well. Large markets across the globe are delivering consistent results in the consumer money transfer. Our customer bill payments turnaround continues and Western Business Solutions is providing strong growth. We are comfortable in affirming our full year revenue and moving earnings per share to the high end of the previous range, and we are on the track to complete the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition in the fourth quarter. So thank you once again joining to call, asking the good questions, and we wish you all a good day. Thanks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate your participation today.

(NYSE:WU)   Q2 2007 Earnings Call  July 24, 2007  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Gary Kohn - IR ", " Christina Gold - CEO ", " Scott Scheirman - CFO ", "Analysts", "Adam Frisch - UBS ", " Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest ", " Jim Kissane - Bear Stearns ", " Liz Grausam - Goldman Sachs ", " Charlie Murphy - Morgan Stanley ", " Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch ", " Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities ", " Tim Willi - AG Edwards ", " Pat Burton - Citigroup ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan ", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Western Union second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Gary Kohn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. ", "Gary Kohn", "Thank you, Annie. Good morning, everybody. I assume by now you've seen this morning's press release. Welcome to the Western Union second quarter conference call. In a moment, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Christina Gold. Also joining her on the call will be Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "On today's call, Christina will review the quarterly results and update you on Western Union's strategy. Then Scott will review the financials in more detail. Following Scott's comments, we will have time to answer your questions. ", "Before turning the call over to Christina, I would like to take a moment to remind you that today's call is being recorded and that our comments include forward-looking statements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2006 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. ", "During the call, we will discuss items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those measures to the GAAP measures on our web site at WesternUnion.com under the Investor Relations section. ", "As a reminder, all statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of the Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call. ", "With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Christina Gold. ", "Christina Gold", "Thank you, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As you have seen this morning, Western Union reported revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.26 for the second quarter. We are pleased with these results, as they are in line with our expectations and consistent with our full year guidance. ", "Some highlights from the quarter: ", "Our Consumer-to-Consumer segment exceeded $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter for the first time in our history. ", "Our Mexico business saw accelerating growth in transactions throughout the quarter with June being the strongest at 9%. These results were ahead of market growth rates for April and May. ", "Our domestic business, which has been and continues to be affected by immigration issues and general market softness, improved. For the domestic and Mexico businesses, we are pleased to see the June transaction trends holding in July. ", "International turned in another strong quarter. India and China continued to power these results and together are now 5% of Western Union revenue. We have nearly 70,000 agent locations in these two countries. The transaction growth rate for India was 76% and it was 22% for China. Significantly, in China, second quarter revenue growth was 31%, which outpaced transaction growth. ", "In a subset of our international business, the nearly $2.5 billion in annual revenue generated from transactions that are originated outside the United States grew revenue at 21% and transactions at 29%. ", "In addition, we remain enthusiastic about our consumer business segment with revenue growth of 13% and a 32% operating income margin. ", "I'd like to make a few more comments on highlights during the quarter, and then Scott will provide further detail on our financial performance. You will recall that to address the issues surrounding our Mexico business, we employed a four-prong strategy: to build our distribution, invest in advertising and promotion, reduce foreign exchange spreads in certain markets, and conduct community outreach to restore the Mexican consumers' conference in Western Union. ", "In the second quarter, we saw further evidence that this strategy is starting to work. Transactions in our Mexico business increased 5% in the quarter versus 2% in the first quarter. Our results show that the actions we took in the first quarter got the Mexican customer back at the right price. ", "We understand that this improved transaction growth must translate into revenue growth. Thus, as we move through the second half of the year, we expect that revenue and transaction growth rates will converge and revenue growth will turn positive. Mother's Day in May is an important indicator for how we are doing in the Mexican market. We are pleased to report that we exceeded last year's strong Mother's Day performance with a similar level of marketing investment. ", "Our international business delivered transaction growth of 20% and revenue growth of 14% in the second quarter. These results reflect the power of our distribution network of more than 312,000 agent locations, over 250,000 of which are outside the United States. ", "In May, we met with our agents in Istanbul. It was one of Western Union's largest agent meetings ever with 500 agent participants from 120 different countries, representing 150,000 Western Union locations. The meeting was an opportunity for me to spend time with agents. It is clear how powerful the energy is that they bring to this business and the amazing things we can do together. It is their efforts that help build our business and ensure we connect with our customers. ", "We recognized many of our agents at the Istanbul meeting for their outstanding performance. For example, the Network Expansion Award for the agent with the most locations added for the year went to Wiseman Forex Limited in India. They added a total of 2,700 new locations, which represents 60% plus growth in 2006. ", "The Newcomer Award went to the Russian Post, which had 41,000 locations and added Western Union services to 2,000 of these locations in a six-month timeframe. Transaction and revenue growth is ramping up nicely. ", "Western Union is growing its market share and expanding its global presence by executing against four key strategies: ", "(1) To expand and diversified global distribution; ", " (2) To build our brand and enhance the consumer experience; ", " (3) To develop consumer choice and convenience; and ", " (4) To develop new technologies and service offerings. ", "Innovation is top of mind for us. We have a number of pilots in the market today, and although they are not contributing meaningfully to revenue currently, we will continue to evaluate the viability of each to ensure we are investing appropriately to drive future growth, including attracting new customers to Western Union. ", "Mobile money transfer -- using a cell phone to send cash -- is a promising technology that is getting a lot of industry attention. Mobile technology represents an opportunity to make Western Union service available to consumers with whom we do not do business today. Through a pilot program now in several U.S. cities, we have demonstrated the feasibility of transferring money via mobile phones for payment at any Western Union agent location worldwide. We are now in active discussions with leading mobile network operators and expect to launch expanded market tests this year. ", "We are well-positioned to attract these new customers. Moreover, we are best in class in areas that are critical to succeeding in the mobile market. We have extensive compliance capabilities and systems, the ability to handle cross-border transactions, an expansive physical agent footprint worldwide for putting cash in and taking cash out, and the trust that consumers have in the Western Union brand to get the money there. ", "Also in the area of new offerings, we are especially proud of our recent development with the Western Union prepaid MasterCard. As you may know, we introduced this reloadable, open-loop debit card in 2004. We are continually identifying ways to make the card easier for consumers to find and to use. One such innovation is to provide the card in-lane at agent locations, meaning that shoppers can easily find and buy this reloadable Western Union MasterCard right in lanes at the cash register. ", "The card features a variety of loading mechanisms, including payroll deposits, and it can be loaded at any of the nearly 50,000 Western Union agent locations in the United States. We are currently piloting this in-lane service with our valued partner, Kroger, at 200 of its stores in the Atlanta area. We expect to be in-lane with additional partners in the future. ", "We are also testing a Western Union and money transfer card that is available on J-hook displays at selected Mac's convenience stores in Canada. Mac's parent company, Alimentation Couche-Tard, is the third-largest convenience store operator in North America. It is also Canada's third-largest retailer with over 2,000 stores. We are in the early stages of the program with Mac's, but we have already observed that customers are sending cash within Canada and to the U.S. as well as Jamaica, Nigeria, the Philippines and Korea, among others. What's more, many of the customers using the card are new to Western Union. ", "On the consumer-to-business side, the Western Union Global Business Payment service was launched. This offering is a web-based service that provides small to medium-sized businesses a variety of different payment options. The pilot service is a fast and reliable way to make foreign currency payments from the United States to over 100 countries. ", "Another area we focused on is the possibility of using the Western Union International Bank to enter the micro finance or micro lending space, which involves loaning or advancing money to consumers. We recently held a summit in Austria to investigate the potential for a Western Union micro-lending initiative. The meeting included a variety of attendees, including participants from the World Bank. ", "To oversee our brand, new product and innovation efforts, we recently announced the hiring of a Chief Marketing Officer. Gail Galuppo comes to us with more than 20 years of industry experience in financial services. Most recently, she was Chief Marketing and Customer Officer for Standard Charter Bank in Singapore. Previously, she was with Sears, GE Capital and Discover Card. With the addition of Gail, we have further strengthened Western Union's senior management team. ", "The spin-off from First Data is truly behind us, and we are focused on the future, a future which will include many exciting new offerings from Western Union. ", "Turning now to efforts to build the brand, we currently have nearly 9 million Western Union Gold cards in use in the United States and around the world. We continue to make further enhancements to our Gold Card loyalty program. We are rolling out more non-cash rewards that consumers can earn when they use the card. We have begun working with partners that make it possible for us to offer the customer more reward choices and to make the program more cost efficient to us. These rewards now run the gamut from discounts on food items all the way up to discounts on major appliances. ", "Over the past several years, our Gold Card customer database and other retention tools have helped bring on a distinct change in our business model from a transaction focus to a customer focus. We are very pleased with the Gold Card program, in particular as a means of gaining retention among customers and increasing their certainty of use. ", "Also on the brand front, we now offer our services through four distinct brands, Western Union, Orlandi Valuta, Vigo, and Pago Facil. Each has its unique value proposition, service level and price, giving us a portfolio to serve different consumer needs. We have expanded and will continue to expand Vigo globally into selective markets where demand exists for this service. ", "We introduced Vigo in Italy by opening approximately 40 agent locations in very strategic areas. We are attracting new customers as they seem to be switching to Vigo from their previous provider. We have seen little cannibalization of our existing Western Union customer base in the overlapping geographies. ", "Turning now to our strategy of offering convenience and choice for consumers, you'll recall that we introduced WesternUnion.com in 2000 to make it easy to send money transfers over the Internet. In the United States, this business slowed when there was a significant increase in fraud as a result of increased retail credit and debit card database compromises. We are working hard to solve this problem and Scott will detail more in a moment. Despite recent challenges, we remain fully committed to WesternUnion.com. ", "Also in the area of consumer choice and convenience, we are leveraging the Western Union network to build a substantial international intra-country business. Currently, we are seeing transaction growth of over 30% on the international intra-country transactions. It is our expectation that the intra-country business outside the United States will be an $80 million business in 2007 with Chile and the Philippines being strong contributors. ", "Another example of convenience and choice for customers is the work we have done in Brazil. Until fairly recently, 100% of our Brazilian business was inbound. However, after describing the reliability of the Western Union network and services to Brazilian regulators, we received approval to open the Brazilian market for outbound transactions. In fact, 10% of our Brazilian revenue is now outbound. ", "As a part of our strategy to expand and diversify global distribution, we had a number of key signings and renewals in the second quarter. Among these are Checksmart and Ahold in the United States, Australia Post, Nepal Post, Israel Post, Ecobank, an African banking group with agents covering a potential of 17 countries, and CASH Express in Bulgaria. Also, Orlandi Valuta added 14 new agents throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. As of June 30, we had more than 312,000 agent locations worldwide, comfortably on-target to reach our year-and 2007 goal of 325,000 locations. ", "On June 1, we renewed our cooperation agreements with Eurogiro. As you may know, Eurogiro plays a vital role in the worldwide payment system. There are 24 Eurogiro members that act as Western Union agents, including Deutsche Postbank, La Banque Postale of France, and Correos y Telegrafos of Spain. This is a very important renewal for Western Union because it strengthens our strategic relationships with post offices and post banks worldwide. ", "Of the new contracts I just mentioned in the United States, Checksmart, with more than 260 locations in 11 states, previously used a competing money transfer provider. Checksmart is now offering core services from Western Union including money transfer, money orders, and bill-payment services. This new contract gives us eight of the top ten check-cashing chains in the United States, which parallels our position of having eight of the top ten supermarket chains in the United States. ", "In summary, I am very proud of Western Union's accomplishments. As a quick recap, our Mexico strategy is starting to work, and we've made further progress in stabilizing U.S. domestic and posted strong international growth. We have advanced a number of new product initiatives and hired a new CMO to spearhead these efforts. We renewed and signed many new contracts, expanding the Western Union brand presence around the world. These accomplishments have helped keep us on course to meet our guidance for 2007. ", "At this time, I will turn the call over to Scott, who will explain the financial results in more detail. ", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Christina and good morning. As you have seen in this morning's press release, we delivered earnings per share of $0.26 for the second quarter. Notably, this figure includes an incremental $8 million of public company expenses and $47 million of interest expense, which together represent the equivalent of $0.04 per share. Accordingly, when comparing this year's quarterly results to last year's, bear in mind that we did not have these expenses in the second quarter of 2006. ", "Year-to-date cash flow from operations is strong at $487 million. We now expect to deliver full year 2007 cash flow from operations of approximately $1 billion versus our previous expectation of $900 million. This difference is primarily due to stronger working capital. ", "Capital expenditures were $31 million in the second quarter of 2007 and $69 million year-to-date. I should add here that our capital expenditures expectation for full-year 2007 is now approximately $200 million versus our previous range of $200 million to $250 million. Capital expenditures for agent signings and renewals will be less this year than anticipated. Agent signings and renewals remain on track, but we expect to be making less upfront capital payments for these contracts. ", "Revenue for the second quarter was $1.2 billion. Of this figure, $16 million was contributed by the Pago Facil acquisition; a further $15 million came from a favorable currency translation on the euro. ", "Second quarter operating income on a GAAP basis was $323 million, a decline of 1% compared to the second quarter of 2006. Excluding $10 million and $2 million of incremental public company expenses in the second quarter of 2007 and 2006 respectively, operating income growth was up 1% year over year. The timing of incremental public company expenses will vary quarter by quarter and we still expect incremental public company expenses to be less than $60 million in 2007. ", "Our tax rate was 31% in the second quarter, compared to 32% in the second quarter of 2006. ", "During the quarter, Western Union repurchased $168 million of the company's shares at an average price of $21.61 per share. We now have purchased over $300 million of the company's shares under the $1 billion board-authorized stock-buyback program. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we plan to accelerate our stock repurchase activity. The goal is to buy back an additional $300 million to $400 million of stock during the second half of 2007. ", "We expect that our year end debt balance will be slightly higher than the $3 billion originally planned. We do not expect our long-term A3 or A- credit ratings to change as a result of our increased stock buyback. We continue to expect full year pricing investments to be approximately 3.5% of revenue and for our marketing spend to be approximately 6% of revenue. ", "Regarding WesternUnion.com, the full impact of the fraud issues that began in February of this year were felt in the second quarter with revenue and transaction growth trends turning negative. The situation has not worsened, so we continue to project the same $20 million to $30 million revenue shortfall for this year, as we discussed in April. ", "Here is an update on the actions aimed at getting it headed in the right direction. Our operations and risk management teams are working closely with card-issuing banks and the card associations to reduce fraud and increase card acceptance. Specific steps include adding new security features to combat fraud, redesigning our process to validate the customer's identity at the initiation of the transaction, and improving call center procedures to identify fraud. As a result of these steps, card-issuing banks are beginning to approve more transfers on WesternUnion.com. ", "At the same time, we plan to extend WesternUnion.com to more and more countries. We have set ourselves the goal of adding Italy and Spain during 2007. The international online business is 20% of WesternUnion.com's revenue and has been growing revenue and transactions in the 60% range. WesternUnion.com is currently offered in only 12 countries but the international opportunity here is significant. ", "Western Union continues to deliver strong profitability with second quarter operating income margin of 27%, which is consistent with last quarter. When comparing the operating income margin from the second quarter 2007 to last year's second quarter operating income margin of 29%, keep in mind two factors: (1) the ongoing mix shift to the faster growing but lower margin international business, and (2) greater incremental public-company expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2007. ", "Going forward, we expect to continue to achieve strong operating income margins in the business. Several factors will contribute to this. First, as the higher margin, U.S.-based business stabilizes further, there should be some offsetting of the faster-growing, lower-margin international business. ", "Second, we will continue to leverage our scale and improve our cost structure. Here are some examples of expenses savings initiatives. Last month, we consolidated support for agents and customers in the Asia Pacific region by moving a regional operating center from Australia to the Philippines. We took a number of steps to create synergies and reduce costs at Vigo and Orlandi Valuta. We combined sales forces, which reduced cost and improved effectiveness. Additionally, we have made several system enhancements that allowed us to eliminate over 40 temporary contracts. Already, we have seen improvements in Vigo's operating profitability. Being a global company, we will continue to have opportunities to optimize our cost structure around the globe. ", "On another note, bear in mind that the completion of the proposed acquisition of First Data Corporation by KKR will impact our EPS and may impact our weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. Assuming completion of this transaction in the third quarter, there will be an acceleration of a FAS 123 R Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Charge that would impact Western Union\u2019s EPS by approximately $0.02. Of course, this is a non-cash item. This potential $0.02 charge and impact on weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding is not included in our 2007 EPS guidance. ", "In closing, let me say the second quarter was gratifying for Western Union and our 5,900 employees around the world. We worked hard to reverse a negative trend, and we are seeing clear progress. Despite external challenges, we are right where we should be and we remain enthusiastic about a strong second half for Western Union and our shareholders. ", "Thank you. Annie, with that we are ready for our first question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Adam Frisch - UBS. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS", "Thanks and good morning. I just had a quick question on the margin. Even if I add back the $10 million in additional operating costs from being a public company, I still found margins to be down about 160 basis points, year over year. So, I'm not sure why you didn't include more specific guidance in that release. Can you tell us where we should expect revenue acceleration and margin expansion in the second half of the year, if you could quantify that a little bit? ", "Christina Gold", "I think, just in the margin, as we look at the first half of the year, we basically are on plan and the second quarter was certainly what we expected in terms of margin and results, so we're very comfortable with that. Going forward, I will ask Scott to just give a little color to that. ", "But as you look at revenue, clearly that's going to be our challenge as we look to the remainder of 2007. As I said before, the second quarter was where we expected. We are very pleased with the results we saw in Mexico and also the stabilization in the United States. International was extremely strong as we showed you with that segment which is non-U.S.-based. We have planned this out very carefully. It's not a slam-dunk but we've worked out all of our corridors, we've worked out all our countries, our pricing, and we've really, day by day, calculated what we need to do to be able to meet the guidance for the remainder of the year. ", "As we sit right now, we feel we can make that number. It's not going to be easy. It's well planned, well thought out and we feel that we have the plans in place to make it happen. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS", "That's for the revenue side? ", "Christina Gold", "Yes. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS", "Then on the margin side, where can they go in the second half of the year? ", "Scott Scheirman", "On the margins, Adam, we are very pleased. Both first and second quarter margins were at 27%. As we see the U.S.-based business is getting stronger, that will help our margins as we move through the third and fourth quarter. Also, we will continue to leverage our fixed cost structure. We are a global business; we do business in 200 countries, so a lot of opportunities to continue to strengthen our cost structure and improve our operating efficiencies. But we continue to see margins being in that 27% range as we move through the third and fourth quarter. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS", "Christina, glad to hear you talk about some of the emerging areas in the business. Specifically on mobile, I've been talking about that for a little while, so I appreciate you finally addressing it, which is great to see. But on the mobile part, you spoke to the new customers that you will be able to attain. Could you also speak to the potential cannibalization threat? Because I'm assuming not only with mobile but also the card-based products, most of these are going to be lower price points, so while you will be able to attract new customers, I'd also want you to address what it could do to your existing customers. ", "Christina Gold", "First of all, just to clarify a little bit too, on the tests that we had, and it's limited in terms of what we've been able to see, but on the mobile side, it's a very low principal movement. You are looking at a principal movement of under $100, so it's a completely different type of consumer. It's really not your average remittance customer. So in terms of pricing and profitability, we feel that we can maintain our business pretty solidly there because it is a very different type of customer. So, we look at that as an incremental opportunity. ", "The same happened in terms of the card-based products that we see. Again, a smaller amount, partly driven by compliance because we can only go to certain limits in terms of the total principal. Again, we are able to maintain our price advantage in terms of where we are, so I don't necessarily see that as going to lower fees. I think it's a different customer with a different price point. ", "In terms of cannibalization, I think this is a lot further out. I think that, as we look at it, we can move from left to right. I think it's a question of finding the right delivery mechanism for the customer and what they want to use, because it's still a question of cash-in, cash-out. When you load up a phone, you have to go to an agent and load it up somewhere, and then taking it out is, again, going to an agent. We can send a message or a cell phone transaction can occur to another cell phone advising the receiver to go and pick up the cash. But it still requires that physical location. ", "So I think our network, our brand, our strength and also the power we have in compliance is very important for us as we look at these two new types of mechanisms. I don't see them as a near-term threat; I see them as a great opportunity for us to get to new customers. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS", "One final question on the agent fees. You took out free cash flow because I think you saw lower cap payments in terms of renewing existing agents or signing on new agents, which was great to see because we thought there was a lot of pressure out there. Are you signing smaller? More agents but they are smaller? ", "Christina Gold", "No. Adam, I would say we are signing the right ones and the ones that we need; small, big and large, all of them. You know, you look at the Eurogiro agreement, which is very important to us, so we really are signing what we planned to sign. I think it's just a question of how we negotiated the contracts in 2007. ", "Adam Frisch - UBS", "So are lower cap payments being offset by higher pay outs on a per-transaction basis? ", "Christina Gold", "I think it all balances out. Scott, is there anything? ", "Scott Scheirman", "In some cases, it's all economics of the amount of the upfront cash payment and the commissions, but it's the same economics one way or the other, so just how we've negotiated the agreements. We have great partners around the globe. Eight of the top ten check cashers in the U.S. and eight of the top ten supermarkets in the U.S. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest", "I wanted to ask you more about the domestic market. I realize transactions were a little bit negative. I wanted to know, do you think this is more competitive or the market? Has the market just gotten so competitive that this is what we should anticipate going forward, or is this more the result of everything else happening in the environment? ", "Christina Gold", "I think it's a combination of things. I think we've been doing a lot of testing in the U.S. market to see kind of what variables are making the difference in the marketplace. But clearly, we had some issues in the marketplace. We see there is competition but it's also a question of just we see some impact in our business because of the economics just in the United States. So I think it's a combination of all; it's not one particular thing that's impacting that. But we are pleased to see that we're coming out of the second quarter in better shape and going into the third quarter, we are seeing the continuation of that improvement, so I feel very encouraged by that. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest", "Scott, you talked about margins in the second half being around 27% and the opportunity to really leverage some of the infrastructure costs that you have in place and the U.S.-base business is getting stronger. Would you think that this trend would continue into 2008 because you're starting in 2007 and obviously the first half of 2007 was weak, so would this continue to 2008? ", "Scott Scheirman", "How we think about it is that we want to continue to keep strong margins; I will call that 27%. We also want to balance those strong margins with investing properly in the business to grow the business. We have about a 17% market share and enormous opportunities to continue to grow that. So as we move towards 2008, we will share more information with you of our thinking about the 2008 numbers and our strategic plan, but our goal is to have strong margins. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest", "Are there any significant contract renewals for agents coming up in 2008? ", "Scott Scheirman", "I don't want to discuss any specific contracts. We are very much on track to renew the contracts we want to. We are on track for the 325,000 agent locations, so we are in very good shape. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTN Midwest", "If you look at the overall market excluding Mexico, is pricing about where you would anticipate or are there other corridors that are maybe getting aggressive? ", "Christina Gold", " I think we said last quarter where our pricing is, we'd move from about a 3% to 3.5% and that we are consistent with that. I think there's always corridors around the globe where you do feel pressure from competitors from all over the world, but that's something in our day-to-day business that we deal with, but at 3.5%, we feel pretty comfortable with what we have in our plan. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Kissane - Bear Stearns. ", " Jim Kissane - Bear Stearns", " Can you give us a little more color on the SG&A trends, specifically around advertising and marketing? It looks like it was maybe flat to even down, year to year. ", " Christina Gold", " Jim, we're still are around the 6% to 7% on the advertising and marketing. However, I would say a little bit more in 2007 has gone to the pricing side; that 0.5% we've moved over to that side. Maybe Scott can give you a little more flavor on that. ", "Scott Scheirman", "The marketing in the second quarter, Jim, is actually about 6.4% of our revenues; that's up from the first quarter about $7 million additional spend from the first quarter. I would say that the team around the globe has done a good job of managing our expenses, spending our money wisely and leveraging our fixed cost structure. ", " Jim Kissane - Bear Stearns", "I think there's some concern about just the revenue growth guidance. So you are sticking to the 10% to 11%, but it's a little more challenging? ", " Christina Gold", " We are sticking to it. We have a plan for it; it's a challenge. I mean, obviously we are where we expected at the end of the second quarter, so that's very encouraging for us. We hit the numbers that we expected. So, we recognize there's a challenge in front of us, but we have the plans in place, the way we see the line of sight at this point, to achieve that number. ", " Jim Kissane - Bear Stearns", "I know in the past you've said CapEx was elevated in '06 and '07, and that you would expect it to tail off somewhat in '08. Is that still the case? ", " Christina Gold", " Yes, I think we did give guidance today that is coming down about the $200 million or under $200 million, and that's because of some changes in how we've done some of the contracts, but I think, going forward, we are in good shape for that. ", "Scott Scheirman", "Jim, I still expect 2008 to be less than $200 million, as we've talked about before. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Liz Grausam - Goldman Sachs. ", "Liz Grausam - Goldman Sachs", " I wanted to discuss the trends in the international division. You know, on a fully reported basis, I still saw a little bit of softening in the quarter from 21% to 20% quarter on quarter, but you did disclose for the first time the transactions that are not touching the U.S. but it is the first quarter we've seen those. Can you help us understand the trends of those numbers that we've seen over the past few quarters so we can understand what has been U.S. pressure versus what you're seeing really on an international basis? ", " Christina Gold", "I would be happy to, Liz. I think the 29% and 21% really gives you the strength that we have of all those businesses that are not touching the U.S. That's been consistent with the first quarter. Where we really saw a little bit of a dip is where you take the 20% in the 14%; that's really the impact of some of the U.S. outbound, particularly to Latin America. We see some of that and that is coming back to some of the issues in the United States, into Central America and other parts of Latin America. That's really what has taken a little bit out of there. ", "Liz Grausam - Goldman Sachs", " So you have seen trends in Mexico bottom and start to turn up a little bit, domestically bottom and start to turn up a little bit? When are we going to see that inflection point in the Latin American business? ", " Christina Gold", " I think we will see that. As we look at our business, the Central American business did not flow as rapidly as we saw the abrupt drop in Mexico and domestic last year when we look at our charts and see April, May, June, and it really went very rapidly. So I think we will see that come up as we come through the back half but again, it's a combination of all of the elements that make that 20% and 14%, but still very good numbers, and international outside the U.S. is extremely strong. ", "Liz Grausam - Goldman Sachs", "On your financial services strategy, you mentioned micro-finance for the first time on this call. If you could help us understand the timing, some of the regulatory issues that you may have to work through in order to become a more full-service financial firm, particularly out in Europe, and when we can expect to hear updates on that? ", " Christina Gold", "I'm having an update with the team next week. We are very rapidly looking at this to try to come into some plan, hopefully into 2008. But in terms of the regulatory front, it is not so complicated for us because we have a bank in Europe, and we can use the banking license to drive that. What we're looking at is whether we do small loans through the bank in Europe through micro-lending, and/or at the receive side whether it would be in Africa and other parts of the world, but using our database, which we know a little bit about our customers from our Gold Card program, and looking to create something very unique. ", "We feel this is a huge opportunity for us. It really takes us to the next step in terms of that relationship with that customer who sends money with us who has other needs. Now, let's look at how we can do small loans at rates and things that are very competitive and really compelling for the consumer. ", "Liz Grausam - Goldman Sachs", " Do you think that's a 2008 revenue opportunity? ", " Christina Gold", " Yes, but I don't think we're going to see a huge number right away. I think what we've tried to do and the way we work it is work out the kinks, get it to work, make the prototype work and then expand it and roll that out around the globe, where we see it fits.

Did you say that, in the second half of '07, you expect the company to post 27% EBIT margins in total?

", " Christina Gold", "I think we are seeing a number of things happening in the domestic business. I think one of them is that we've done a number of strategies as it relates to our Hispanic consumer, where we had a real issue because of some of the activities in Arizona. As we saw the improvement in Mexico, we are also seeing an improvement in the Hispanic numbers in the United States, and that's starting to lift somewhat, as we saw in the second quarter. ", "We also have been doing a number of price tests and also really grassroots testing and seeing what's the right combination for this business in terms of making this really, let's say, a grower -- not a double-digit grower, but a nice grower. ", "I think for us, we really feel the stability of it moving up, probably not doing any major pricing or movement on that product, just doing some more testing as we go through '07. I think that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of moving forward. ", " Charlie Murphy - Morgan Stanley", "C2B margins were around 32% this quarter. Do you expect that level to persist through the rest of the year? Do you see margin improvement in that business? ", " Christina Gold", " We feel really good about this business. I think it's right on track where we expected it to be. We are constantly looking at other opportunities, whether it be in the acquisition area or whether it be in new products, because we have a new global business payment product for small businesses.

", " Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch", " I know you guys don't like to give too much detail on this, but can you at least talk about the performance of Western Union-branded versus Vigo, versus Orlandi and the U.S. to Mexico corridor? ", " Christina Gold", " I can give you a little flavor on it. I think, obviously, the biggest challenge for us going into the second quarter was Mother's Day because that was the only time in the second quarter of '06 where we had a strong push. We were able to, with the Western Union brand this year, exceed the number that we had last year. ", "As we came out of second quarter, all brands are positive in terms of transactions, so we got the lift in Vigo but now Western Union is ramping up very nicely. So I'm very pleased to see the progress because that is really a key brand for us, and it's doing well. ", " Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch", "Vigo, you guys talked to this a little bit; you talked to the integration. But how much longer is there to go until we see sort of full profitability realized on the Vigo side? ", " Christina Gold", " It's really improving, and Scott can give you some update. I think the other thing with Vigo is, as we drive the business and leverage it across the world, we can leverage our fixed costs. That's going to be one of the keys is to expand that business worldwide. Scott, maybe some more details than that? ", "Scott Scheirman", "What I would add is that our profitability continues to improve. The first quarter of this year was better than fourth quarter, and second quarter this year was better than the first quarter, so the profitability continues to improve. We have a plan and we're working that plan very hard. I will say that Vigo will not see the margins like Western Union does because of how it's positioned in the marketplace and the service offering and so forth, but we are very focused on driving Vigo to strong, strong profitability. ", " Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch", "So you are going to fully take the Vigo brand and continue to roll it out internationally? ", " Christina Gold", " Yes, we are. I think we just highlighted on this call, we've taken it to Italy and we very strategically placed in markets where we feel it's appropriate. We will take it to markets where it fits and where we see an opportunity for incremental growth. ", " Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch", "Last question on WesternUnion.com; correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like everything is fully up and running. It's just the question of the individual transactions, whether that individual consumer's card gets approved or denied for that transaction. In the background, you are continuing to work with the banks to increase those acceptance rates. Is that really the only issue going on? ", "Scott Scheirman", " That's correct. It's just working with our customers and the card-issuing banks to get their transactions approved. ", " Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch", "So anyone can go on there and attempt a transaction. It's just whether or not it gets approved by the issuer? ", "Scott Scheirman", " Absolutely.

I understand the temptation to view this as a cannibalizer of your business, but looking at the transaction sizes and looking at your typical customer -- meaning cash in a shoe box, un-bank types in faraway markets -- and also looking at the numbers we've gathered specifically in the China market, looking at the average size of your transactions, to me this just seems like this is a very far-off cannibalizer to your profits. ", "The discussion right now, to me, seems a little premature. I do understand the need to discuss technology. I was hoping you can discuss that versus your average customer and their actual desire for this in places that are your receiving markets, like China, India, Eastern Europe, so on and so forth. ", " Christina Gold", "Craig, I think you are very, very correct in what you say. The concept of cannibalization in the money transfer business is far off because, if you look at our average transaction, it's $350, but in some markets, it's over $1,000 so the concept of mobile phones being the mechanism for that transfer really seems far off at this point. ", "However, there has been a lot of noise in the marketplace. Plus, it is a technology that is using our core assets, which is really transfer of funds, compliance, regulatory capabilities. What we saw in the small tests that we've done is this is a very different customer. So for us, as we look at this business right now, we're not looking at it as something for the money transfer business, but rather there's a subset of customers out there that want to use this technology to transfer funds. We have the brand; we have the capability. So, we feel this is really an opportunity for us to create another subset in the business, learn about it and then be in position at some point, if it ever shifts in our market -- but that's a long way away \u2013 we would have that capability. ", " Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities", "If I can just ask you a second question about Brazil, if you could talk about what facilitated that change of heart by the regulators, and if there was a competing business there versus Western Union? I'm curious if you have the same prospects for lifting some of your restrictions in a place like India. ", " Christina Gold", " Well, this is something that we work on on a continuous basis. I think we have a great team on the regulatory/public affairs side and also our in-country management team, who meet regularly with regulators. Also, our agent in Brazil is the Banco do Brazil, which has been important for us in our transactions. They also are very connected in terms of trying to help us make that happen. ", "There's been a number of things that have happened with this that also opened up for foreign exchange houses to become agents, so that opens the landscape a bit more. So it's really a matter of perseverance and time. It's very similar to what happened in Mexico when we launched the outbound business there, about two years ago I think. I know I spent some time there, our regulatory affairs people, we met with the government and over a period of time, they finally said that we could have an outbound business. Now, we have a very nice business growing at a nice clip coming out of Mexico. ", "So we are working in India; I will be in India next month. Again, we will go back to the regulators, but these things take sometimes years, but it's about a relationship with our company, the trust in our company, the trust in our brand, and going backwards to these regulators and really working to get the approvals.

", " Christina Gold", "As we look at pricing, remember that we did lift the next-day product up to 1,000. We expanded that band in the first quarter. Where we really focused across all three brands was really our foreign exchange spread. Since the second quarter, really the first quarter, it's been pretty stable. We don't see any major shifts in pricing as we move into the second half. So, the strength that we gain in transactions will then really push up that revenue line as we move forward. I think we feel pretty comfortable with that; I don't see anything changing on that front. ", " Tim Willi - AG Edwards", " Great. Then my second question had to do with the new Chief Marketing Officer, realizing that she's obviously only been with the company one or two days here. Could you just talk about what you would like to see happen or what that experience and skill set brings to Western Union that may not have been there, particularly in a lot of those markets in the Far East and Middle East, areas like that, that you think can really help the franchise expand? ", " Christina Gold", " Well, we announced her hiring. She is actually not in the door yet. She's coming in another couple of weeks. I think with Gail's hiring, she brings a tremendous skill set to us. First of all, she has experience in the financial services area, and she really understands the financial services and the banking side, the marketing side and the customer side, so that's a tremendous asset. As I have gotten to know her in discussion, she also has a great knowledge of understanding databases and information, not just from the U.S. but really across the globe, and one of her strengths is innovation and product development. I think I felt sometimes on the call it's a little frustration that people are looking for new products a little faster from us. So we need someone to really help us spearhead that initiative, and that will be her responsibility. ", "I must say also we do have excellent marketers in all of our countries around the globe. We have people who really understand the ethnic consumer and they are terrific. So taking her brand skills, her products skills, with our ethnic marketing skills I think will just be a powerhouse for us. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Pat Burton - Citigroup. ", " Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", " Congratulations on the quarter. My question, Christina, has to do with the compliance and regulatory capabilities of Western Union. Briefly, could you just talk about what barrier to entry that is to some of these emerging technologies and what these companies will have to go through to know their customers before they can effectively move significant amounts of money? ", " Christina Gold", "I think, clearly, as we've seen over the last five years, compliance is top of mind, not only in the United States but every country around the world. We at Western Union have almost 300 people in compliance and we spend over $32 million a year to support compliance. ", "The real issue here is that it's know your customer but also know your receiver, to know your network on the send and receive side; you need to have information. You need to be able to file reports on suspicious transactions if something occurs. So, there really has to be, at the point of entry of cash and the point of receipt of cash, there has to be controls that run against databases, whether it be databases in the United States or in the UK or in Australia; there's hundreds of them. So every country has their own control mechanism. Everyone has to understand the regulations of every single country. So if you have capabilities to make phone calls to 200 countries, you also have to have capabilities to deal with regulators in 200 countries because each country is separately regulated and moving money is different than sending a phone call. ", "There's a high level of concern about governments in terms of understanding through the Patriot Act, understanding with the concerns of antiterrorism, that there really has to be tight control. For us, it's of prime importance. It's a huge asset and a brand strength, but also it's a risk to anyone who gets into this business and doesn't have the right controls because, clearly, there can be tremendous issues that would happen to a company that did not comply properly, who did not understand what the rules were. ", " Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", " Thank you. As a follow-up, do you have any idea what percentage of the users or a rough approximation in the U.S. might be tied to the home-building industry? Thanks. ", " Christina Gold", " In terms of our product, I think that there is a large percentage of our consumers in the Latin American base who are tied to construction. I think, though, that some of the impact we see in the domestic business and also the U.S. to Latin America does have an impact. In terms of exact numbers, I couldn't say, but I would be saying maybe in the 30% range, but I would really have to go back and double-check and see if I can get a better answer for you. ", " Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "That 30% would be in the Latin America and Mexico corridor? ", " Christina Gold", " Yes, that would really be where you see the greatest level of impact. ", " Pat Burton \u2013 Citigroup", " In that corridor. Okay, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan. ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "Thanks for all the details. Just a few follow-up questions. On public-company costs, it looks like you are running at around $25 million, year-to-date. Are you still looking for $60 million for the year? It looks like you are obviously running closer to $50 million. ", "Scott Scheirman", " Yes, we will still be slightly less than $60 million, but the public company spending can vary quarter by quarter depending upon if it's communications, corporate affairs, revenue, we have a new CMO coming on. So those type of things will impact it quarter by quarter, but we will be slightly less than $60 million. ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", " Okay, so it will step up in the second half of the year. I know you commented on sticking with your revenue growth target. Are you still comfortable with your stated 3% to 6% operating income growth target for the year? ", "Scott Scheirman", " Yes, we are comfortable at the low end of that range that we've guided in the April 24 press release. ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "Can you also give us the currency impact on revenue and EBIT in the quarter? ", "Scott Scheirman", " The currency impact was about $15 million for the quarter. I will let you do the math from there, but it's about $15 million of help in the quarter. ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "I appreciate the comments around the prepaid and the micro-lending. Can you just rank in terms of opportunity, micro-lending versus prepaid? I'm curious, on the micro lending side, will Western Union be taking on some of the credit risk or will you be partnering with some other institutions there? ", " Christina Gold", " You know, on the micro-lending side, it's early days yet. We've had some discussions to get a better feel of what the business is. We've talked with our people at the bank. We are looking in terms of whether or not we will partner with others, so I think we will keep you posted on that. But as we look at the opportunity, we think this is a big opportunity for Western Union. ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", " Relative to prepaid, how would you rank micro-lending? ", " Christina Gold", " I think that I would say they are both important and time will tell as we test them out and prove it out, which one. But my leaning is a little more to micro-lending only because of the relationships that we've built with our customers. I don't have the facts yet so I couldn't say that, but that's where I am at on that one. ", " Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", " Thank you. ", " Christina Gold", "Thank you very much, everybody for being on the call today, and also thank you to all of our employees and agents for supporting us in the quarter. We look forward to talking to you in the third quarter and appreciate your support. We are very focused on making sure we get the job done. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Iwould now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gary Kohn, Vice President ofInvestor Relations, Western Union. Please proceed, sir. ", "Gary Kohn", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to WesternUnion\u2019s third quarter 2007 conference call. Thanks for joining us today. Beforeturning the call over to Christina, I\u2019ll take a moment to remind you thattoday\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward-lookingstatements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in the earningsrelease and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, including the 2006 Form 10-K for additional information concerningfactors that could cause actual results to differ materially fromforward-looking statements.

", "With that, it is my great pleasure to introduce ourPresident and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina A. Gold ", "Thank you, Garyand welcome, everyone. Before we get into the numbers, I would like to justhighlight the headlines for the quarter. Our Mexico business outperformed themarket and is moving towards positive revenue growth. Our domestic business,while still facing challenges, is improving slightly. The international C-to-Cbusiness remains extremely healthy, C-to-B is performing well, we have madeprogress on the innovation front, we delivered strong operating margins, and wehave seen accelerating organic revenue growth. ", "As you have seen this morning, Western Union reported revenueof $1.3 billion, which is up 10% over the third quarter of 2006. Earnings pershare was $0.30, excluding the accelerated $0.02 non-cash charge, or $0.28 asreported. ", "Operating income margin in the quarter was 28% before the $22million non-cash charge, or 26.3% as reported. Cash flow from operations isvery healthy and on track to exceed $1 billion for the full year. ", "Scott will provide more color on these and other results ina moment. ", "In terms of operating highlights in the third quarter, ourinternational C-to-C business posted strong growth rates, with revenue up 16%and transactions up 20%. A subset of this business, those transactionsoriginating outside of the United States grew even faster with revenue at 23%on transactions of 29%. This is significant in that taken alone, this subset ofour business accounts for nearly half of Western Union\u2019s total revenue. ", "Our Mexico business showed improvement, with transactiongrowth rates continuing to accelerate to 7%. Revenue was down 1%, an improvementover the 7% decline we saw in the second quarter. There were no significantpricing actions implemented in Mexico during the quarter and revenue andtransaction growth rates are converging. ", "Since the second quarter, all three of our C-to-C brands,Western Union, Vigo, and Orlandi Valuta showed strength, with each brandoutperforming the market. The domestic business showed sequential transactionimprovement, with transactions down 4% in the third quarter and revenue down10. Our long-term goal for this business is low single digit revenue growth. ", "The consumer-to-business, or C-to-B, segment posted revenuegrowth of 14% in the third quarter. We are very pleased with the progress weare making with Pago Facil. With nearly a full year after the acquisition, it\u2019son track with our expectations. ", "The segment\u2019s operating margin remains strong at 31%,excluding its share of the non-cash charge. Additionally in C-to-B, weannounced a partnership with Yodlee, a leading provider of online banking andbill payment solutions to financial institutions. This partnership will giveparticipating banks\u2019 online customers the option to make bill payments whichpost immediately to their account. That enables customers to better managetheir resources and avoid late fees. It also gives Western Union, Yodlee, andour bank partners a revenue stream which has never existed before. ", "In sum, we are pleased with the results we reported thismorning and we remain on track to meet our 2007 expectations. ", "As you know, underlying our efforts to build long-term valuefor Western Union shareholders are our four key strategies; one, to expand anddiversify global distribution; two, to build our brand and enhance the consumerexperience; three, to develop consumer choice and convenience; and four, todevelop new technologies and service offerings. ", "In September and October, I circled the globe twice,visiting agents, employees, and customers in India, the Philippines, Australia,Singapore, and the Middle East. In the Philippines, I addressed 400 businessleaders and discussed global migration trends. While there, we also visited ournew regional operations center, where we welcome 80 new employees whocollectively speak 17 languages. I also spent time discussing the businessopportunities with our agents. ", "In Singapore, we met with our long-time agent, Hersing, withwhom we recently strengthened our equity relationship. That trip included avisit to our largest location, Lucky Plaza, a flagship location with 28dedicated Western Union counters handling more than 4,5000 transactions a week.", "In Australia, I celebrated Founder\u2019s Day, the firstanniversary of our New York Stock Exchange Listing, at the opening of our newOceania regional office in Sydney. This was a special opening ceremony that included a traditional aboriginal danceto bless the new premises. After the festivities, we met with several of ouragents in Australia and the Oceania region to discuss how we can strengthen ourrelationship even more. ", "We also made a stop in India to dedicate the country\u2019slocation number 45,000. While there, I met with regulators, agents, andemployees. India is a very important market as 29 million Indians currentlylive abroad. ", "In Dubai, I attended a gala dinner with over 200 people,including Western Union agents from all over the Middle East. Also attendingwere members of media, select dignitaries, and customers from the Philippines,Nepal and Bangladesh. ", "During these trips, one can see first-hand the large globalmarket for money transfers to and from countries and intra-countries. ", "According to recent World Bank data, the number ofimmigrants is now close to 200 million, or roughly 3% of the global population.India has emerged as the number one remittance recipient country, while Chinais number three. The opportunity here is huge, as today these two countrieseach exceed $20 billion in remittances. Together, India and China combinedcontributed 5% of total Western Union revenue. By contrast, Mexico alone is 7%.", "India grew transactions by 69% in the third quarter, whileChina, where we now have 25,000 agent locations, grew transactions by 28%. Ineach of these two countries, third quarter revenue growth exceeded 40%. ", "Within this global money transfer market are especiallypromising, high-volume geographies for Western Union. Take, for example, Dubaito Bangladesh. As you know, Dubai is experiencing tremendous growth, which issupported by a large migrant workforce. Reflecting this dynamic in Dubai,remittances from the United Arab Emirates to Bangladesh jumped by nearly 57% inthe fiscal year ended July 2007, according to the Central Bank of Bangladesh.Western Union has 1,400 locations in Bangladesh to serve these customers. ", "We also strengthened our agent presence in Europe. We signeda new agent, Caixa Central de Credito Agricola Mutuo, one of the top financialinstitutions in Portugal. We renewed our relationship with the Portuguese PostOffice, which has more than 650 locations. In Greece, we welcomed Millennium Bank,with more than 130 locations. ", "In Africa, we added Madagascar Post, and expect to be in 220locations over time. ", "Looking now at recent developments here in the UnitedStates, we renewed our agreement with Safeway. This strengthens our position inthe United States with eight of the country\u2019s top 10 grocery store chains beingWestern Union agents. ", "We also renewed our important and longstanding relationshipwith K-Mart. K-Mart has been offering Western Unionmoney transfers, bill payments, and money orders for 10 years, and we arepleased to be expanding this relationship into select Sears locations. ", "To the north, we signed a new agreement with Wal-Mart inCanada. We plan to be in all 280 Wal-Mart stores in Canada. The pricing andcommission terms are generally consistent with our existing Canadian business.We are pleased to partner with Wal-Mart and believe that our strong brand,effective ethnic marketing capabilities in country, as well as our complianceefforts, made us the logical choice. ", "In the area of intra-country distribution, in Chile wesigned Tur-Bus. With this agreement, Western Union intra-country money transferservices will be offered in up to 500 additional locations in Chile. ", "All told, we added 8,000 agent locations this quarter,bringing our total to 320,000. This keeps us on track to reach 325,000 agentlocations by the end of the year. ", "Turning now to the area of brand and consumer experience, inSeptember, in conjunction with the Western Union Foundation, we launched a $50million, five-year initiative to provide education and economic opportunity tomigrant families around the world. The Western Union Our World, Our FamilyProgram will provide tools to help family improve their language skills, managetheir personal finances, and take better advantage of economic opportunities. ", "We have also focused our efforts to raise brand awarenessamong specific migrant groups through targeted, ethnic marketing. Some examplesof recent local marketing events include: a pan-gulf campaign to celebrate Ramadan;sponsorship of the FBA European Basketball Championship in Spain; and theback-to-school promotion in Africa, where receivers are given essential schoolsupplies with each transaction. ", "Our efforts to support the Western Union brand are going onquite literally all over the world. Take, for example, a rural area of India,north of the city of Bangladore, near [my store]. During our recent trip, on aSaturday, 760 India Post workers put on Western Union T-shirts and paradedthrough the streets, handing out pamphlets on making money transfers. When youwitness as I did 760 postal workers forming a sea of Western Union yellow inrural India, you understand the power of our brand. ", "Brand awareness among Indians living in the U.K. was just41% in 2002, and in 2007 jumped to 98%. Brand awareness of Indonesians livingat Hong Kong was just 1% in 2004, and has leaped to 87% in 2007. The power ofthe Western Union brand and strong, localized, ethnic marketing will continueto drive growth for Western Union. ", "Our ethnic marketing efforts also paid off recently inFrance, where our Western Union gold card was recognized with the country\u2019sleading professional communications award called the GoldTop Com. Our successful gold card program now has over 9 million cards inthe hands of our customers in 65 countries. ", "We were also recognized by the Direct Marketing Associationduring its recent meeting in Chicago with a Silver Apple award for our serviceexcellence program in Europe. ", "On the convenience front, we are utilizing our Western Unionclick cash offering as a new away for Google to make payments. Google needed asolution to pay commissions to publishers participating in their AdSenseadvertising program in countries where sending and cashing a check is time-consuming,unreliable, and expensive for recipients. Western Union's technology andextensive physical distribution was the answer. ", "Today, Google uses Western Union click cash to make paymentsto publishers in Argentina, Chile, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Peru,Philippines, and Romania. The cash is available to the recipient within minutesof the payment being processed by Google and can be picked up at any WesternUnion location in the publisher\u2019s country. ", "Turning now to new technologies and services, last week weannounced that Western Union joined forces with the GSMA, the global tradeassociation with 700 mobile phone operators, including Smart and Globe in thePhilippines, and [Varti] in India. The mobile operators in GSMA\u2019s membership serve2.6 billion customers, which is 82% of the world\u2019s mobile phone users. ", "Western Union and the GSMA are developing a commercial andtechnical framework that mobile operators can use to deploy services thatenable customers to send and receive money transfers using their mobile phones.These transactions will be low denominations, high frequency money transfers. ", "Western Union is in a unique position to build this market.We already have all the necessary components, extensive compliance capabilitiesand regulatory knowledge, the ability to handle cross-border and intra-countrytransactions, an expansive physical agent footprint worldwide for putting cashin and taking money out, and the trust that customers have in the Western Unionbrand to get the money their safely. ", "The mobile money transfer target consumer represents a new,adjacent market for Western Union; a consumer who has the need for morefrequent, lower principal transactions. The mobile money transfer marketpresents an exciting long-term opportunity in the coming three to five years. ", "On the micro-lending front, we continue to explore theviability of this new offering. Initially, the loans would like be small dollaramounts. The consumers for loans of this size often have no formal credithistory and are thus overlooked by most financial institutions. That\u2019s whereWestern Union is different. ", "These unbanked, or under-served customers are regular usesof our remittance services. We are taking a look at the logistics, includingdetermining the reliability of our scoring methods and talking to a number ofpotential partners. It is our intention that these partners would underwritethe loans and thus carry the risk on their balance sheet. ", "Before turning the call over to Scott, I would like toreflect for a moment on Western Union's first full year as a public company. Itwas a year and three weeks ago that we began trading on the New York StockExchange as WU. We have accomplished a lot since then. We have establishedourselves as an independent, public company; complemented our leadership withnew senior talents; acquired and integrated Pago Facil, opened the Asiaregional operating center, launched three new Westernunion.com countries,implemented a strategy that will successfully restore consumer confidence insending money to Mexico, turned Vigo profitable and launched Vigo service inItaly, passed the 320,000 agent location mark, on our way to 325,000, launchedWestern Union Our World, Our Family as a tangible way to give back to the peoplewe serve. ", "There are a lot of people involved in this effort and Iwould like to acknowledge Western Union's 6,000 employees and our worldwideagents for all of their hard work during our first year as a public company. ", "Our first year has had its challenges, to be sure, but weare pushing hard on our core business and some of our initiatives, our newinitiatives, are really gaining traction. Revenue growth is accelerating,margins are strong, cash flow is robust. We are 100% focused on driving the nextphase of growth and building shareholder value. ", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Scott, whowill review third quarter financial performance and 2007 outlook in greaterdetail. Scott. ", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Christina. Revenue for the third quarter was $1.3billion, up 10%. Of this figure, $18 million was contributed by Pago Facil and$16 million came from the Euro. The revenue growth this quarter was driven byimproving consumer-to-consumer segment results. C-to-C revenue growth was 10%on transaction growth of 15%. International consumer-to-consumer revenueincreased 16%, while transactions were up 20%. As Christina mentioned, our pureinternational C-to-C business, that piece excluding U.S. originatingtransactions, posted revenue and transaction growth of 23% and 29%respectively. ", "Full year price reductions look like they will be about 3.3%of total Western Union revenue. ", "The consumer-to-business segment increased revenue 14% ontransaction growth of 71%. Operating margin in the segment remained strong at31%, excluding the non-cash charge, or 29% reported. ", "In the third quarter, we recorded the previously discussed$22 million expense related to the required quick vest of stock options andawards as a result of the KKR First Data deal. ", "Let me provide you with some color on where the $22 millionexpense is recorded. The split is one-third in cost of services and two-thirdsin SG&A. When looking at the segments, the split is 85% in theconsumer-to-consumer segment, 13% to the consumer-to-business segment, and 2%in corporate and other. ", "Third quarter operating income on a GAAP basis was $330million, a decline of 2% compared to third quarter 2006. On an apples-to-applesbasis, operating income grew 6% when excluding $18 million and $14 million ofincremental public company expenses in third quarter 2007 and 2006respectively, and the $22 million non-cash charge. ", "When comparing third quarter 2007 to last year\u2019s thirdquarter, remember that in addition to the non-cash charge, third quarter 2007included an incremental $4 million of public company expenses and $46 millionof incremental interest expense.", "This quarter will be the last time it will be necessary tobreak out public company expenses since we now have four quarters as a publiccompany for the purposes of prior period comparisons. ", "On the margin front, operating income margin was veryhealthy at 28.0%, excluding the $22 million non-cash charge, or 26.3% on areported basis. We continue to leverage our scale and improve our coststructure. Going forward, our goal is to achieve strong profitability whilemaintaining the appropriate level of investment in the business for futuregrowth. ", "Also on margin, it is important to note that ourinternational operating income margin has improved as we continue to gainscale. In fact, for 2007, we expect the international C-to-C operating marginto be in the mid-20s. ", "Our tax rate was 30% in the third quarter, compared to 32%in the third quarter of 2006. We are estimating a full-year tax rate ofapproximately 30%. Increased foreign derived profits compared to U.S. derivedprofits have helped lower our overall effective tax rate. ", "Year-to-date cash flow from operations are strong at $883million and we remain on track to deliver full-year cash flow of more than $1billion. ", "Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $54 millionand are $122 million year-to-date. We still expect total 2007 capitalexpenditures to be less than $200 million. ", "During the quarter, Western Union repurchased $300 millionof the company\u2019s shares at an average price of $19.59 per share, and we havenow purchased $601 million of the company\u2019s shares. We continue to believe ourstock represents a real value at these levels and we intend to be an active purchaserin the open market from time to time. ", "Let me clarify the potential dilutive impact from the changeof control of First Data. First, all of the outstanding options that were inthe money have been factored in our fully diluted shares outstanding since wewent public in September 2006, whether they were vested or not. ", "Second, the quick vest that resulted when the deal closedhas in itself caused dilution of less than one-fourth of a cent. Any futuredilution from this quick vesting will be the result of the rate at which optionholders exercise options net of the number of shares we buy back with theproceeds from the exercise. We will monitor this closely. ", "Today, our cash priorities remain to invest to grow thebusiness, make acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders, primarilythrough stock buy back. As you know, we have $400 million left under thecurrent board authorized buy-back and anticipate going to the board in thefuture for additional authorizations. ", "Our 2007 earnings per share guidance assumes diluted sharesoutstanding of approximately 772 million shares. ", "With the credit crunch in the news recently, we wanted touse this quarter\u2019s conference call to discuss any exposure Western Union has tothe credit markets. The short answer is very little. Western Union participatesin the money order business by offering Western Union branded money orders.However, we do not carry the full balances on our balance sheet. ", "You will, however, see on our balance sheet settlementassets related to our business. There is very little exposure in these assetsdue to the recent credit market issues. ", "As of September 30th, our total settlement asset balance was$1.4 billion, of which $378 million is cash, $879 million is agent receivables,and $154 million is highly rated municipal bonds. ", "We are pleased with the results of this past quarter and thetrends within the business. We now expect full year revenue growth of 10%. Wealso anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.09 to $1.11. Thisrange now includes the $0.02 impact from the non-cash charge and assumes afull-year tax rate of approximately 30%. ", "Please note when we originally issued our earnings per shareguidance, it did not include the $0.02 impact from the non-cash charge. ", "In summary, we are pleased to have delivered financial andoperating results in line with our expectations. Western Union has strong cashflows and we are well-positioned to invest in the future and return value toour shareholders. ", "Carol, with that, we are ready for the first question. ", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from theline of Craig Maurer with Calyon. Please proceed, sir. ", "Craig J. Maurer -Calyon Securities", "Good morning. I was hoping you could discuss two items; one,how you view the continued extreme weakness in the housing market as it relatesto your business; and two, in relation to the addition of Western Union inCanada, what other geographies around the world that Western Union participatesdo you feel might be basically primed for your participation? Thanks. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "Thank you very much, Craig. Just in terms of the housingmarket, clearly we have -- we look at our business in terms of the 200countries and really assess all of the risks around the world. And as we lookat the issue in the United States, it has had some impact but we have felt thisimpact for a period of time, so we feel very comfortable in our projections andwhere we are going for the remainder of 2007 and confidence with the guidancethat we\u2019ve given. I think we have a portfolio that is large enough to balanceoff the risks. ", "In terms of the Wal-Mart relationship, we do have anotherrelationship with Wal-Mart in Argentina and we are always interested in talkingto people about becoming a member of the Western Union family, but we wouldonly let you know at some point when that happens and it actually occurs. ", "Craig J. Maurer -Calyon Securities", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Grausamwith Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Elizabeth W. Grausam- Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. You guys had some pretty significant agentrenewals and wins this quarter, including Safeway, K-Mart, and Wal-Mart, yetyour margin outperformed certainly my expectations and your count backs reallydidn\u2019t perk up at all in the quarter, relative to where we thought. ", "Can you just make some comments on how you feel about thepricing dynamics and your agent renewals, and whether or not they have actuallybeen a little bit better than your expectations? Because it certainly feelslike it, relative to our estimates. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "No, I think we feel very confident in terms of our agentrelationships and the power of the Western Union brand and really what we bringto an agent. So we have not seen a real issue there in terms of renewals and weare delighted to have the Safeway contract signed and also the K-Mart and thenmoving into Sears. So for us, and also as you saw, even with our relationshipin Singapore, it actually will give us a better level of profitability in ourbusiness. So we feel very good about where we stand and our CapEx is rightwhere we expected it to be, because all of these contracts were factored intoour numbers. ", "Scott, maybe you\u2019d like to add a little color to that. ", "Scott Scheirman", "We\u2019re clearly signing all the agents we wanted to resign andsigning new business, and we project our capital expenditures will be less than$200 million, but we\u2019re tracking exactly where we expected. ", "Christina A. Gold ", " And you know, oneother thing I just want to add; one of the things that we\u2019ve always said isthat we have discipline in our resigning, and even as we bring on new agents,like Wal-Mart, we do have a very disciplined approach to the financial returnfor the company. ", "Elizabeth W. Grausam- Goldman Sachs", "Great, and then, just on the strategic side, Christina, itcertainly feels like there\u2019s a much firmer focus on the innovation at WesternUnion now, with your GSMA announcement, obviously Google as well, in this pressrelease. Can you talk about management\u2019s focus now that you\u2019ve moved throughsome of the real cyclical downturn in the U.S. market? Do you feel that thereis a better focus internally on looking forward and driving new growthopportunities in the business? And do you feel that you have the rightmanagement team now in place to really execute against that going into 2008. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "I feel really confident about our future and where we\u2019regoing. I think that clearly we had some challenges in \u201907, but we\u2019ve worked ourway through them and it really shows the power of our team in being able toreally look at what we need to do in the marketplace to achieve our results,but also, our focus on innovation and looking at ways to really add more valueto the shareholders in terms of new products and new services for ourcustomers, that\u2019s really a driving force for us in \u201908, as we saw with the GSMAand the Yodlee announcement. ", "And also, with Gail coming on board and we have a fullcomplement of management, I think I\u2019ve got the team, we\u2019ve got thecapabilities, and we are really ready to roar into 2008. ", "Elizabeth W. Grausam- Goldman Sachs", "Can these initiatives actually accelerate growth in 2008, oris it longer term?", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think some of them are longer term. I think some of thethings in the C-to-B business will see traction in \u201908, but I think if you lookat the GSMA, that\u2019s much longer term and a lot of that is dependent also on themobile operators being able to put sort of M-wallets in the mobile phones, andthat\u2019s going to take some time to really get traction. ", "Elizabeth W. Grausam- Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Kissane withBear Stearns. Please proceed.", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "Thanks, and good job, guys. Scott, could you provide alittle more insight in terms of the margin trends in the internationalbusiness? I think you said they were mid-20s, but where were they and where doyou think they can go?", "Scott Scheirman", "We are very pleased with our margins, both at the WesternUnion level and at the international level. Historically, as we\u2019ve built ourscale in Europe and in Asia, each year we\u2019ve seen our margins continue toimprove. On a go-forward basis, our goal is to have strong margins. We want tobalance investing in the business, the innovation things that we want to do.Knowing that we\u2019re in 200 countries, we have a 17% market share, we want tocontinue to increase that. ", "But I also know margins represent a proxy in our businessfor cash flow and shareholder value, so our goal is to balance both of thoseand have strong margins on a go-forward basis. ", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "Okay, but they are mid-20s today, right? ", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, mid-20s in 2007. ", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "Can you just give us a sense where they were say three yearsago?", "Scott Scheirman", "Lower. But we continue to gain scale and gain leverage andwe\u2019ll continue to work our margins and drive our business for growth andinvestment. ", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "So with international growth somewhat faster as it is, youstill think you can maintain say a 27% or so margin?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, we want to have strong margins. ", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "Okay, great, and just normalized CapEx, I mean, this yearyou said it will be less than $20 million. Last year was somewhat higher. Doyou think you get back to closer to $100 million?", "Scott Scheirman", "Right now, our view for 2008 is less than $200 million, andagain, we\u2019re trying to balance signing new agents, investing in the business,and resigning agents. But we believe for 2008, we\u2019ll be clearly less than $200million. ", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "Okay, and just one last one; intra-quarter trends for U.S.to Mexico and domestic transactions?", "Scott Scheirman", "We\u2019re very pleased with the Mexico business. It was up 7%for the quarter. We outperformed the market. As we look at the C-to-C businesseach month during the quarter, a very solid growth and we are very pleased withit. ", "James F. Kissane -Bear Stearns ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Burtonwith Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Patrick M. Burton -Citigroup", "Good morning and congratulations as well. Christina, couldyou outline the steps you are going to take in the U.S. domestic business toget back from the negative 10 revenue this quarter to let\u2019s say low singledigits sometime next year? Thanks. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think there\u2019s a couple of things. One of the key issues wesee in the domestic business is our card not present transactions, and that\u2019sabout, in terms of our transaction impact, it\u2019s about 200 basis points. So weare working very aggressively with our team in terms of with the banks in termsof accepting those transactions, because that will be important for us to seethat improvement. ", "Also, we\u2019ve done some testing in terms of marketing mix inthe U.S. and we\u2019re seeing some things we feel can give us traction, so I thinkwe\u2019ll continue to drive forward in terms of our marketing investments, lookingat that, and also remember that we did some pricing on the next day productearly in \u201907 and so we\u2019ll be lapping that in \u201908, so that\u2019s had a fairlydramatic impact on it this year, so we\u2019ll see movement forward as we go into\u201908. ", "Patrick M. Burton -Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta withFTN Midwest. Please proceed.", "Kartik Mehta - FTNMidwest Securities ", "Thank you. Scott, I know at the beginning of yourpresentation, you indicated what you wanted to use free cash flow --investments, acquisitions, and share buy-back. As you look at the pipeline andyour opportunities, are there sufficient -- are there a lot of opportunitiesfor acquisitions, or do you think that based on the amount of free cash flowyou are generating, you\u2019ll always be very active in buying back your shares,assuming the price is right?", "Scott Scheirman", "As we look at our acquisition pipeline, we do business in200 countries, so we are very focused internationally on acquisitions and wesee opportunities out there to buy companies. Also, you\u2019ve got to take intoconsideration I\u2019ve got over $1 billion of cash in my balance sheet I can usefor international acquisitions. So as we go forward, it\u2019s going to be really acombination of investing in the business, acquiring companies, and thenreturning value back to our shareholders through stock buy-back, but there areopportunities out there and we want to take advantage of those at the righttime, at the right price. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTNMidwest Securities ", "It sounds like with that $1 billion plus, all the free cashflow you\u2019re generating, you will -- it sounds like you will always be buyingback shares, or at least returning the money to shareholders in some way, someform. ", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, our goal is to return value to our shareholderssomeway, somehow, absolutely. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTNMidwest Securities ", "Christina, you talked a little bit about the domesticbusiness and maybe a portion of why it\u2019s slow. How fast do you think the marketis growing? Do you think the market has also declined significantly -- specificWestern Union issue that\u2019s hurting you right now?", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think when we look at the domestic, it\u2019s not a fast growerat all. I think we see it\u2019s a flat to up a couple of points, so I think it\u2019sreally a question of looking at that market and then positioning ourselves interms of mid-single digits. I think that will be very comfortable for us andfor our customers. ", "What we really want to do there is look at innovation aswell and see if there are other products and services, and that\u2019s one of themandates that Gail is looking at, is how do we add more into that consumer toreally grow that business and that\u2019s really where we have to go. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTNMidwest Securities ", "One last question on the Mexico market, obviously if youlook, compared to the second quarter, you are making strong progress. It soundslike pricing is going up, obviously. Are we at a point where you think pricehas stabilized and it will be difficult from here over the next six to eightmonths for prices to go up higher on that market? Or do you think there is anopportunity for that corridor to maybe see some increased pricing because ofthe stabilization?", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think it\u2019s very stable, as we look at it right now, andthe pricing has been stable really for most of the year, so as we look to that,I don\u2019t see really prices going up or down. I just see really a status quo, butas we see the power of our brand and the work we\u2019ve done in market, we seecontinued growth and moving towards positive revenue for Western Union, whichwe are very pleased to see. And, you know, we did beat the market. ", "Kartik Mehta - FTNMidwest Securities ", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of ChristopherMammone with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Christopher Mammone -Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Do you have for the quarter the revenue growth inagents over which Western Union had an ownership stake? And also the attachedcommission growth on that?", "Christina A. Gold ", "You\u2019re talking about the equity investments?", "Christopher Mammone -Deutsche Bank", "Yes. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "We don\u2019t actually pull those out but they are all -- when Ilook at it, just from top of mind, they\u2019re doing extremely well, the equityinvestments that we have. We\u2019re pleased with that. ", "Christopher Mammone -Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and also, Christina, could you maybe give us an updateon Westernunion.com?", "Christina A. Gold ", "Westernunion.com continues to grow exceedingly well ininternational. Because of the fraud issue that we\u2019ve had in the United States,we\u2019ve been having some challenges but we are working very closely with thebanks and with our IT and technical people, and we hope to see that correctitself within the next couple of months. ", "Christopher Mammone -Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Murphywith Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Charles A. Murphy -Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Looking back over the past couple of years, itlooks like the third quarter is for some reason or other the most profitablequarter for the C-to-C business. Could you review if that\u2019s true and why that\u2019strue? Looking forward, should investors expect this type of margin from theC-to-C business over the next few quarters?", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think if you look at the quarters, I think actually thefourth quarter is probably one that\u2019s more profitable but it really dependsjust on mix of businesses as we go through a year. But obviously, as Scott saidearlier, our objective is to be 27 and plus in terms of margin, so we feel verygood about what\u2019s been accomplished in the third quarter. ", "Again, with the up-tick in revenue, that all comes to drivethe profitability. Scott, I don\u2019t know if you want to add something there. ", "Scott Scheirman", "What I would add, Charlie, is as we move into the thirdquarter and especially move into the fourth quarter, you do see a little bit ofseasonality in the business. During the fourth quarter, there\u2019s a lot ofsending around the holidays to loved ones, so we usually see a nice up-tick inthe revenue in the fourth quarter, and a little bit in the third quarter. Butour goal is to have strong margins as we move forward. ", "Charles A. Murphy -Morgan Stanley", "And quickly, Scott, could you just review again what thetotal public company costs were in the third quarter of \u201907?", "Scott Scheirman", "The third quarter of \u201907, they\u2019re about $18 million. Rightnow, we are on a run-rate. We think that will be a little bit less than $60million on a full-year basis. ", "Charles A. Murphy -Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huangwith J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Tien-Tsin Huang -J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Just as a follow-up to that, to the last question;the incremental public company costs, $4 million, does that compare to theincremental of 60 for the full year? Because I think you had $10 million in theprior year, correct?", "Scott Scheirman", "In the prior year, we had about $14 million. In the secondquarter, we had $10 million and we had about $18 million in the third quarter,so you kind of go through some peaks and valleys, depending upon how we spendmoney. But on a full year basis, we\u2019ll be a little bit less than $60 million. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang -J.P. Morgan", "Okay, got it. And then the -- I guess just -- I went back toyour original spin presentation. Is your long-term EPS growth still 12% to 14%and operating income growth of 10% to 12%?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, our long-term objectives are 10% to 12% revenue andprofit and 12% to 14% earnings per share, as our long-term objectives. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang -J.P. Morgan", "Got it, because I was happy to see the bigger sharerepurchase. I\u2019m just trying to, at least in terms of next year, sort of betterappreciate what\u2019s going to drive the acceleration in operating income growthfrom the 6% reported in the third quarter. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think one of the key things is going to be the organicgrowth in revenue in the business, and just if you look at the strength of ourinternational business, at 20% transactions and 16% revenue, and the subset ofthat at 29 and 23, that\u2019s one of the powerhouses. And as we see now Mexicocoming in, we\u2019re getting stabilization and improvement in domestic, really allof our businesses are moving in the right direction and C-to-B is very strong,so I think that\u2019s going to be a key component of that. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang -J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then thanks for sharing the international C-to-Cmargins. I guess just to also clarify, the margins in I remember Asia-Pac weresomewhat depressed due to some build-out costs. Is there still some room toimprove the margins there in the short-run?", "Christina A. Gold ", "I think there\u2019s -- what you see is as you get scale and asyou build the cycle of business, you see the margins improve. So we\u2019re in themid-20s for the total of the international business and clearly in some of ourmarkets in Asia, we\u2019re at a much more, a nascent stage. ", "If you look at India and China, it is only 5% of ourrevenue, so as they continue to build, we\u2019ll see much more leverage on thebottom line. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang -J.P. Morgan", "Okay, got it. Last quick question; the profitability on Vigo,any update there?", "Christina A. Gold ", "Things are looking good. Scott\u2019s been doing a great jobthere. ", "Scott Scheirman", "Vigo, the profitability continues to improve. Q3 was betterthan Q2 and I think we reported last call, Q2 was better than             Q1, so we continue to make theimprovements we need there and it\u2019s not quite where we want it but we are on afast track of where we need to be, so we are very pleased with that. ", "Christina A. Gold ", "The other thing is that next year and as we go through theremainder of this year, we\u2019ll be pushing harder into international rollout,which will also leverage some of our expenses as well.

Management", "Good morning; two questions, one is if you could break outagain the allocation of the charge between cost of goods, SG&A? If it\u2019s inthe press release, just direct me to that. I couldn\u2019t spot it. ", "Second question, back in the first quarter you mentionedthat debt reduction was a priority and you said future growth was second andthird was returning capital to shareholders. And then you look for a $3 billiontarget by the end of the year. And then second quarter, you mentioned that thetarget was slightly higher than $3 billion. And now I don\u2019t hear any mention ofdebt reduction at all. Have you changed these targets then? It looks like youhave changed the priorities, and can you tell me why?", "Christina A. Gold ", "I\u2019m going to pass it on to Scott, but just in terms of ourdata, I think we feel pretty comfortable in terms of what our level of debt is,because we wanted to maintain our ratings, so we\u2019re very comfortable with that.But Scott can give you more color on that. ", "Scott Scheirman", "On the debt, you\u2019ll see on the balance sheet, we\u2019re about$3.3 billion and that\u2019s exactly where we want to be, so you won\u2019t see, as apriority anymore for cash, any reduction of debt. We\u2019ll keep that right around$3.3 billion and it has the credit ratings right where we want them. ", "On the allocation of the non-cash charge, about a third ofthat went to cost of services and about two-thirds of that went to SG&A. ", "Paul Salmika - WillisN. Management", "And as far as why you stopped at 3.3 instead of going downto the 3?", "Scott Scheirman", "The $3.3 billion gives us the credit rating that we arelooking for, and so we are just trying to find the optimal leverage in ourbusiness on our balance sheet to move forward. ", "Paul Salmika - WillisN. Management", "So what would the target be for leverage and how do youmeasure that?", "Scott Scheirman", "We\u2019ve got good relationships with our rating agencies andwe\u2019ve got targets in mind, but our goal is to be at that A-minus credit ratingand that\u2019s where we\u2019ll maintain it as we move forward.

", "Gary Kohn", "Thanks, (Shikwana). Good morning, everybody and welcome to the Western Union fourth quarter 2007 conference call. Thank you for joining us. Before turning the call over to Christina, I would like to take a moment to remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward-looking statements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2006 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Other than the replay, Western Union does not authorize, and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call. ", "With that, it is my great pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold ", "", "Thank you, Gary and welcome, everyone. As you have seen this morning, Western Union reported a solid fourth quarter in line with our expectations. This is our first full calendar year as a public company and I am proud of our accomplishments. In particular, revenue growth accelerated during the year, up 12% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. Driving these results were the combined strong growth of our international C-to-C business which contributes nearly two thirds of our revenue and a 13% revenue growth of our C-to-B segment. Supporting this growth was Pago Facil's overachievement of its first year business plan. ", "We achieved full year GAAP EPS of $1.11 or $1.13 excluding the third quarter non-cash stock compensation charge. We continue to drive on the innovation front to ensure that we are positioned to take advantage of long-term opportunities. We've built on our strong financial position and we generated $1.1 billion of cash flows from operations during the year. We achieved a healthy 27% full year operating margin and we maintained a solid balance sheet with excellent financial flexibility. Once again, our results demonstrate that Western Union is a diverse global company benefiting from strong migration trends and remittance needs.", "In the fourth quarter, the international transactions that originate outside of the United States accounted for 54% of our total revenue compared to 48% in the fourth quarter last year. This subset is the fastest growing component of our business, growing revenue 23% and transactions 29% in 2007. ", "Our domestic business experienced a challenging year, and we do not expect major improvement in this business over the next 12 months given the current US economic conditions impacting our customers. However, we do plan to invest prudently in brand awareness, customer acquisitions, loyalty and retention programs like the Gold Card, and to improve westernunion.com.", "In Mexico, which now ranks as the third largest remittance market in the world, our transaction growth rates continue to outpace the growth reported by Banco de Mexico. Also, the difference between the revenue and transaction growth rate narrowed in the quarter, further reinforcing that our pricing is at the right levels. We have made no significant price decreases in the Mexico business since early 2007. Our strategy to promote our three brands, Western Union, Vigo, and Orlandi Valuta and to expand distribution is helping us in Mexico. ", "Accordingly, we expect to have modest growth as we continue to gain market share in 2008. In the fourth quarter, and throughout the year, we furthered our strong position in many of the world's leading remittance markets. We have been in the United Kingdom for nearly two decades. In 2007, we nearly doubled our presence to 7,000 locations through our existing FEXCO relationship and with two additional equity agents, Costa and Finint. The focus on expanding our distribution in this market and investing in brand awareness is paying off. Transactions grew by 30% in 2007. We will reopen in South Africa after a six year absence. We have received all the regulatory approvals and will be announcing our rollout plans shortly. ", "In India, the world's largest receive country; with $27 billion in annual remittances we recently celebrated the opening of our 50,000th agent location with the State Bank of India. In the quarter, revenue was up 45% and transactions were up 68%.", "In China, which passed Mexico to become the world's second largest remittance country with $26 billion in annual remittances, we posted solid growth with revenue up 37% and transactions up 24% in the fourth quarter. And we are delighted to have welcomed China Everbright Bank as an agent with their 300 branch locations across 30 cities in China. ", "Combined, India and China now represent 5% of Western Union's annual revenue. That's up from 4% in 2006 and 3% in 2005. There is a lot of opportunity in these two countries and we are very well positioned for continued growth. ", "The Philippines is the fourth largest received country in the world with an estimated $17 billion in annual remittances representing 13% of the country's GDP. We have over 7,000 agent locations in the Philippines and in 2007 our inbound remittance principal grew over 40%, well ahead of the healthy market growth of 11%. ", "In addition to our outstanding inbound business, by leveraging our existing network, we have built a successful intraservice in this market and in the near future we will further complement our network with mobile offerings. ", "Underlying our efforts to build value for Western Union shareholders are four key strategies: One, to expand and diversify global distribution, two, to build our brand and enhance the consumer experience, three, to develop consumer choice and convenience, and four, to develop new technologies and service offerings. In the fourth quarter we made progress in each of these areas. We exceeded our expectation by finishing the year with more than 335,000 agent locations, a milestone we are very proud of. ", "We added Penn Traffic, a supermarket operator in the Eastern United States with over 100 locations. They previously offered services through a competitor. We formed a new relationship with the Bangladesh Post, adding nearly 450 locations to offer even more convenience to our customers in this important country.

So, we see it as pretty steady - the normal pressures - but there\u2019s really not a great push for a compression of margins and driving pricing to a deeper level.\u00a0 I think the other very good news is we\u2019ve done a number of re-signing of key agents around the world, and as we\u2019ve negotiated the contracts, and they now have scale and size in terms of their business, we are negotiating those contracts to our advantage as it relates to commission.\u00a0", "Elizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co", "Great.\u00a0And then just overall market pricing trends, you obviously have a very large competitor that is having some internal problems and liquidity problems.

So, I don\u2019t think we see that impact in there and internationally we have numerous competitors so it\u2019s not just that particular one but there are banks and other institutions. The one thing I will say that is the strength of Western Union is that it is so important, as we sign up agents who are banks and post offices and large government entities, that we have a good credit rating.

So we\u2019ll balance with that for growth. But we do want to have strong margins. We equally understand that\u2019s a proxy for cash flow and profitability and shareholder value. But I will say my international business where our margins in the mid 20\u2019s have been very strong and even throughout 2007 that margin moved up slightly throughout the year.

So it\u2019s not just the new markets but our established markets as well. I feel very strong about it. And also, we have the flexibility to invest more in some of the faster growing markets so we can balance our portfolio at any given time.\u00a0", "James Kissane \u2013 Bear, Stearns & Co.", "Okay. Two last questions. How fast can you ramp South Africa? Because I think going way back, that was about 1.5 to 2% of revenue. And the last one, westernunion.com in the US, Scott, when do you think you can get that fixed?\u00a0", "Scott Scheirman", "Let me first speak to westernunion.com, Jim. 2007, I would really call the year of getting the security and the fraud things fixed and right. And we worked hard on those. Our banks are accepting the credit cards. We\u2019ve implemented some technology things. The goal for \u201908 is to really focus on the customer experience. It\u2019s a little bit cumbersome to do a transaction on westernunion.com, so a combination of technology, high leveraging our Gold Card and some other things, we want to improve the customer experience in 2008 on westernunion.com. ", "And we do think there\u2019s continued opportunities to grow that business. Today it\u2019s only 2% of revenues. It can be much bigger than that. And we still have global expansion opportunities. The international business grew 45% this past quarter, so it\u2019s been very strong there. On South Africa, we have the regulatory approval to move forward there. We want to be as quick in that market as we can be, and we expect to make progress there in 2008.", "Christina Gold", "\u00a0", "Just on South Africa too, I was talking with the team last week. We do have agents in sight and everything is lined up. I think what we want to do is make sure that we enter the market with as much push, as fast as we can, but that we get a global hit. Because obviously there\u2019s pockets all over the world, and also South Africa itself is a send country because it is an important market within Africa itself.\u00a0", "James Kissane \u2013 Bear, Stearns & Co.", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Christina Gold", "Okay.", "", "Operator", "\u00a0", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Elving with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Joshua Elving \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "\u00a0", "Hey, good morning. I have a couple of higher-level questions, and I guess the first one I have is there\u2019s been a lot of various projections of the world-wide remittance market being about 300 billion, and if you kind of look at your share with some of your competitors, it appears that there is close to 75% of remittances world-wide that are done through informal channels. What level of that remaining 200, or a little bit more, billion is actually addressable and could be picked up through formal transfer?", "Christina Gold", "I think that when you look at the numbers a lot of the numbers that are issued are formal channels, and the informal is not necessarily accounted for in that number. So, there's actually more than that 300, so you can talk about 400. So, it\u2019s a huge market. So when we look at our share, we continue to grow share every year so for us, that's what we think is the huge opportunity. If we just look at the amount of principal that's moving around the world, last year the principal globally was running at about 8%. We're running in around 20-24% so we're growing three times faster in terms of principal. We see huge opportunities for growth. ", "Also, the other thing that\u2019s happening is the phenomena as we\u2019ve become more global world, the informal channels, governments are pushing to drive the funds into more formal channels because of a lot of concerns about many issues in terms of money laundering and terrorism, and so that also helps us because we have such a compliant, robust system to move money. ", "Joshua Elving \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "\u00a0", "Thanks. And then just on mobile transfer, there seems to be some conflicting thoughts with regards to what that opportunity really is, longer term. I think you suggested it in your opening remarks, just about how you\u2019re very active in the Philippines, and I believe the Philippines was kind of a test market for a lot of the mobile transfers, and it seems to have picked up pretty aggressively there. Can you give us any kind of an update on the Philippines and what you think is the bigger picture?", "Christina Gold", "\u00a0", "Well as I said earlier, the Philippines market is the number four largest remittance receive market in the world. Money moving into the Philippines last year grew 11%; we grew 40%. So we feel very comfortable in terms of our growth. In the mobile, the ", "Smart and Globe are both carriers that have m-wallets, because you can\u2019t do mobile transfers without m-wallets. So the fact that they have that capability now allows us to hook into, with our money transfer system, to create a methodology in terms of transferring funds to the Philippines. ", "This is actually our first test outside of the United States. We will be doing that in second quarter. But we have been doing some testing in the United States, and what we have seen with mobile is low-ticket send. Our average is about $53, just to put it into perspective, and our average remittance is much larger. So, this consumer is not the same consumer. This is someone that wants to send a small amount of money very quickly more frequently. We see this as an add-on. It\u2019s all a test, it\u2019s all learning, but huge opportunity for us in a market where we have inbound, we have intra, and now we have mobile. And also, as I said, we\u2019re working with India, the largest remittance market in the world, to develop a methodology to do it with Bharti Airtel into India as well.", "Joshua Elving \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "\u00a0", "Thank you very much.", "Christina Gold", "\u00a0", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "\u00a0", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\u00a0", "", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning. Not to be the dead horse here, but I wanted to talk more about the international C-to-C margins. I wanted to get a sense for \u2013 you talked about mid 20\u2019s for the year, but the progression during the year, where we exited the year, and I think it would be very helpful to get a sense for how it\u2019s ramped year-over-year, \u201907 versus \u201906.", "Christina Gold", "\u00a0", "I\u2019ll say a little bit, and then I\u2019ll give it to Scott. I think the thing to look at is, you really have to think, if we go back to say, Asia, when we started, our investment was almost 12% of revenue just to get the marketing up, to get everything up. So the margins were much lower. As we\u2019ve come through now, that\u2019s starting to support our total international margins. As Scott said, it\u2019s in the mid 20\u2019s and it continues to accelerate as we move forward. Not rapidly but it's moving up, not down. So, Scott, if you want to add a little more color to that.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yeah, well what I want to add is we\u2019ve built the global footprint, whether it be in Europe or Asia Pacific or around the globe. We\u2019ve had a certain amount of fixed cost that we\u2019ve had to put out there to build that scale and now we\u2019ve got the ability to leverage that around the globe. You know each quarter in '07, we saw improvements in the margin and on a go for it basis our challenge will be to really balance the strong profitability but also investing for growth. As we talked about a little bit earlier, India and China are only 5% of our revenues. We think there is continued opportunity to grow that market. Mini markets around the globe whether it\u2019s Western Europe or Eastern Europe in Russia, South America, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to increase our market share so we\u2019ll invest\u00a0 but we also want to deliver strong margins to our shareholders. \u00a0", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "It sounds like you\u2019re kind of at the point where you built the scale on the infrastructure and it\u2019s kind of a balancing act of how much leverage you want to show to the bottom line versus investing for growth.\u00a0", "Scott Scheirman", "Yeah, we\u2019ve really built up the global footprint, you know we have 335,000 locations, we want to add another 25,000 locations to that every year but the global footprint has been built out from an operating stand point.\u00a0", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "In a different direction, the domestic business which has continued to struggle for five or six quarters here seems to be lagging the Mexico turn around and I don\u2019t know if they should be correlated but I would think they would be. I\u2019m wondering why the domestic is taking longer to turn around then Mexico is?\u00a0", "Christina Gold", "I think in the domestic market we see a lot more impact on the housing, what\u2019s going on in construction and in employment and we\u2019ve also seen more impact on the immigration front because it\u2019s across a lot of different dynamics, so that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen. In the Mexico business as well we\u2019ve seen shifts in terms of customers, where they are, some have gone to Canada, some have gone to Europe, but I think that\u2019s why we feel we\u2019re being very tempered in terms of our prognosis for domestic in 2008.\u00a0", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Finally Scott, just quickly, you wanted to recap your comments on the margin expectations in the first half verses the second half, I just want to make sure I heard that right.\u00a0", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure, in the first half of 2008, our margins will be slightly lower compared to the second half of 2008, so the second half of 2008 will have stronger margins. The one other comment I would add, the domestic discussion we had a few minutes ago is that if you think about the fourth quarter, our retail business really had flat transactions, the card not present really dragged that down by a couple of hundred basis points. So the walk in business, we did see flat growth in the fourth quarter on the domestic business.\u00a0", "", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "What\u2019s the reason for the margins being lower in the first half than the second half? Was there any reason for that?\u00a0", "Scott Scheirman", "You know we normally have some seasonality in the business, so you\u2019ll see the seasonality where in the third quarter, especially in the fourth quarter, is our biggest sending time of the year where people send money to loved ones so the revenue really jumps up in the fourth quarter which is really good for our business. We have a fixed cost structure that we can effectively leverage and also in the first quarter of this year we will have about 5 million of operating expenses. It\u2019s in our guidance; the 5 million of operating expenses related to the 120 jobs that we're relocating to Costa Rico.\u00a0", "", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Got it, great. Thank you very much.\u00a0", "", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank You.\u00a0", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank, please proceed.\u00a0", "Unidentified Analyst\u00a0\u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi this is (Vasu) filling in for Chris, if you could just touch on how big you think is the market opportunity for micro lending and mobile remittances and if any meaningful contribution from that is peeked into 2008 numbers?\u00a0", "Christina Gold", "I think as we look at both of those initiatives we\u2019re really at the beginning stages, I think we know it\u2019s a huge market on both. On the mobile, we'll have to see how that goes because the question there is customer acceptance and we see that as a three to five year horizon before it really becomes meaningful if all the tests go well. On the micro lending we are just at the beginning stage working with PrimeCredit, a part of Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, to understand the dynamics of how we could do that, how profitable is it to us, and what is acceptable of this product with our customer. And so I think it\u2019s early days yet to give any kind of number, but I do not see it as being a meaningful number in terms of 2008 revenue or profitability numbers.\u00a0", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Dodd of Morgan Keegan, please proceed.\u00a0", "Unidentified Analyst\u00a0- Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc. \u00a0", "Hi Guys, it's actually Michael stepping in for Robert. Just one quick housekeeping question, and forgive me if you guys have already provided this information but what is your expected tax rate for 2008?\u00a0", "Scott Scheirman", "Our expected tax rate for 2008 is 29%.\u00a0", "Unidentified Analyst\u00a0- Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc. \u00a0", "All right that\u2019s all I have, appreciate it.\u00a0", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes form the line of Adam Frisch with UBS, please proceed.\u00a0", "", "Glenn Fodor \u2013 UBS ", "Hi it\u2019s Glen Fodor again, thanks for the follow up. Just your top line growth guidance of 9 to 11%, can you decompose that into organic or same store growth plus new business less attrition, and then plus or minus pricing?\u00a0", "Christina Gold", "I think in terms of that, all I would say is that we\u2019ve given our guidance in terms of pricing. We\u2019ve expected it to be about 3%. In terms of acquisitions there is no acquisitions in there and there\u2019s no major revenue from any of the new initiatives in terms of mobile or lending and that would be all we could give you today.\u00a0", "Glen Fodor\u00a0\u2013 UBS", "But the portion of growth that comes from just growth at your existing same store locations verses adding new agents, do you have a conceptual view on that?\u00a0", "Christina Gold", "Not really because were adding every year on a same basis of 25,000 locations and it takes a period of time for them to ramp up before they really become active in the network.\u00a0", "Scott Scheirman", "The growth combination of same store sales and adding new locations to the network, it will be a combination of both of those. We have not dissected that in great detail for anyone.\u00a0", "", "Glen Fodor\u00a0- UBS", "Thank You.\u00a0", "", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, thanks for your comments. We're going to turn it back to Christina for closing comments.\u00a0", "", "Christina Gold", "I just want to say thank you again for being on the call today.

Good morning everybody and welcome to the Western Union first quarter 2008 conference call, thanks for joining us today.

", "Also, before turning the call over to Christina, I have a save the date announcement.  Western Union is planning to host an investor day which will focus on our strategy in New York City on the morning of June 20th.  There will be more details coming soon.  With that it is my great pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "", "Thank you Gary and good morning everyone.  As you have seen this morning, Western Union posted a strong first quarter and we are off to a great start in 2008.  Revenue in the first quarter was up 12% or 9% excluding the $33 million benefit from Euro translation.  This is our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating organic revenue growth.  Once again we have strong growth in our consumer to consumer segment with revenue and transactions up 14%.  This performance was driven by 19% increases in revenue and transactions in our international C to C business which represents two-thirds of our total revenue.  The parity in the international revenue and transaction growth rates resulted from the strength of the Euro and from consistent pricing activity.  ", "This is as tight as the spread has been in 17 quarters.  The fastest growing part of our business, the subset of international transactions that originates outside of the United States grew revenue and transactions 28% and 29% respectively.  This subset represented more than 50% of total revenue in the quarter.  In Mexico our strategy of leveraging our three brands, expanding distribution and conducting outreach to the community continues to drive results.  We achieved positive revenue and transaction growth in our Mexico business in this quarter marking the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate improvement.  And with a stable pricing environment, our transaction growth rates outpaced those reported by Banco de Mexico.  ", "Our consumer to business segment continues to grow revenue on the strength of Pago Facil and the demand for electronic bill payments in the United States.  Earnings per share excluding the $24 million of restructuring expenses was $0.29 representing a 16% increase over the same quarter last year.  Reported EPS was $0.27, an increase of 8%.  I am very pleased with this first quarter as is the entire management team.  In this quarter one can really see the strength of our business.  Looking out over the next three to five years and even longer term, we believe that Western Union is well positioned to build shareholder value.  Our confidence in the future is built upon, first, our leading position in the huge and growing money transfer markets.  ", "The money transfer remittance market is estimated to be $369 billion and continues to grow on average 8% annually.  Our remittance principles has consistently grown over 20% annually.  Second our strong Western Union brand, recognized worldwide.  Third, our unmatched distribution network of 345,000 agent locations and of course our financial strength which enables us to grow the business profitably.  In our results, one can clearly see the impact of worldwide migration trends as well as a our return on investments in the brand and agent locations.  ", "In India, the world\u2019s largest inbound remittance country, our revenue grew by 52% on transaction growth of 65%.  In China, the second largest inbound remittance country, revenue growth of 35% was well ahead of transaction growth of 22%.  These markets, the world\u2019s top two remittance receive markets continues to perform very well and now represent 6% of Western Union revenue.  We benefit from migration trends not only in nascent markets like China and India, but also in mature markets.  ", "For example, in the UK, where we have been established for nearly 20 years, first quarter transactions grew 29%.  In January, we articulated our four key priorities for the business.  Our first priority is to grow the C to C business, specifically to maintain the strong momentum in the international business, deliver modest growth in Mexico and stabilize the domestic business.  We are well on our way to accomplish this.  One of the keys in the first quarter was to continue expanding our global footprint.  New and existing agents chose Western Union because of our network, brand and financial strength.  In all we added 10,000 agent locations in the quarter and have a network totaling 345,000 agent locations.  Of particular note in the quarter, we signed Bank Pekao, Poland\u2019s largest bank which operates nearly 900 branches.  ", "This is particularly significant because Pekao has been offering competitor\u2019s money transfer services but they have decided to offer only Western Union services in the future.  We are also excited to be reopening in South Africa after a multiyear absence.  We just signed an agreement to offering inbound and outbound money transfers with Absa, one of the country\u2019s largest financial services organization and a member of Barclays Group.  In the US, we will be rolling out 1,700 additional Rite Aid locations in the former Brooks/Eckerd stores over the next 12 months.  This will give us 4,500 Rite Aid locations.  We are well underway with our Vigo expansion plans.  ", "We are applying for licenses in various European countries and remain on track to further expand in Italy and to open in Spain, Ireland and the UK throughout 2008.  On the brand front, we are evolving our brand strategy to ensure it continues to be relevant to our global consumer.  Our updated strategy focuses on how we help people who are on the move in pursuit of their dreams and how in doing so we help grow economies around the world.  We look forward to sharing more on our brand strategy during our June investor conference.  Enhancing our relationship with the customer and reinforcing our brand is an ongoing effort for us.  One of the most well known customer loyalty programs is the Western Union gold card.  ", "In the first quarter we added 200,000 customers to the program for a total of 9.7 million members spanning 65 countries.  This loyalty program provides us insights on the customer behavior and we use this information for targeted marketing activities and to help us to find future financial service offerings.  To increase convenience and to expand distribution channels, we recently launched westernunion.com in Italy.  Our international dot-com transactions, those that originate outside of the United States grew over 40% in the quarter.  ", "The US dot-com business was impacted by the security issues related to the card not present transaction.  The card no present issues impacted domestic C to C transaction growth rates by about 100 basis points in the quarter.  The issues arose late in the first quarter last year so as we move through 2008, our growth rates will be less affected.  In April, we completed the roll in in Canada of our new collaborative offering with Scotia Bank.  This offering gives us access to a new customer base, the online customer of one of Canada\u2019s largest banks who are now originating Western Union transactions from the bank\u2019s website.  While the service is still ramping up, we are already seeing interest and transaction activity.  ", "The average principle sent by our Scotia customer is twice that of our walk in business indicating that the offering is attracting new customers with different needs.  Our second priority is to expand our C to B business to other countries through joint ventures, acquisitions and Pago Facil expansion.  In addition, on the C to B innovation front, we will increase the number and variety of bill payment options.  As we look to globalize the C to B business, we will be rolling out Pago Facil to Peru in the second half of this year with other Latin American countries to follow.  ", "We are also reviewing interesting pipeline potential international bill payment acquisitions.  In terms of new offerings, we are piloting our cross border bill payment service in 24 states aimed at the increasing needs that small businesses have to make payments to overseas suppliers.  By going to globalbusinesspayments.com, a small business person with the need to pay overseas suppliers can conduct the entire transaction from his or her computer without leaving the office, store or house.  We offer a compelling value proposition for the convenience, speed, reliability and safety of the transaction.  ", "Our bill payment offering through Yodlee is progressing nicely and we expect to make several announcements soon.  This offering leverages our brand and 4,000 US biller relationships to make online bill payment more convenient.  We are excited about the opportunity to extend our brand to a new customer, the online bank customer with the need to have bill payments posted immediately.  Our third priority is to drive innovation by developing new services and technologies.  We are pleased to report that we have successfully tested the prototype for mobile money transfers.  ", "We are on track to go live with a customer pilot in the second quarter with our partners, Smart Communications and Globe Telecom in the Philippines.  In the pilot we will be testing price points that as a percent of the remitted principle are in line with our core walk in service.  We remain confident that this new offering is going to bring new customers to the Western Union brand.  Additionally, we have a US based mobile transfer test with Radio Shack and Trumpet Mobile.  ", "Recently Radio Shack rolled out this offering to its 4,300 locations.  The early learnings confirm that mobile money transfer will be a three to five year opportunity and may be more suited to an adjacent customer, those with the need to send low principle highly frequent transactions.  Mobile money transfer is offered through an M-wallet which an operator must make available to the user.  Currently the number of mobile operators offering M-wallets is limited.  In May I will be in Cairo where the GSM association will hold a summit devoted specifically to mobile money topics.  ", "I will be the keynote speaker at this conference and meeting with many of the mobile operators who expressed interest in working with Western Union.  Also on the new product front, we recently launched a micro-lending pilot.  While we are still in the early stages we are encouraged to see migrants who are well established in the new country trust Western Union for services beyond traditional money transfers.  These 12-18 month installment loans are being marketed to select Western Union customers through a direct marketing campaign.  ", "As a reminder, we are not assuming the credit risk on the loans and are partnering with Prime Credit Limited in Hong Kong, a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank.  Our fourth priority is focusing on profitability.  It is important to emphasize that operating income margin improvement is an ongoing objective for Western Union and we have as a goal margin improvement of up to 50 basis points in 2009.  We expect to achieve this by leveraging our cost structure and identifying additional cost savings initiatives.  With that said we will not forego important investments in the business for compliance, competitive issues or investments for growth.  ", "To improve our profitability, we recently implemented some restructuring plans which Scott will detail in a few minutes.  On a personal note, these restructuring decisions are difficult to make as our employees are an important part of our business and we understand that these actions affect them in significant ways.  On the whole, we are all pleased and I am personally pleased with the first quarter.  The first quarter bears witness to the fact that despite the challenging economic environment, our customers are finding and moving for new employment opportunities and continuing to make money transfers.  ", "The power of being global is that Western Union has a presence in virtually every important cross border market in the world.  We have a world class brand and global distribution but it is the energy and hard work of our people and agents that make the organization complete.  I have great confidence in this team and our ability to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves and Western Union shareholders in 2008 and beyond.  With that said, I would like now to turn over to Scott Scheriman, our CFO who will discuss our first quarter financial performance and 2008 outlook in greater detail.  Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "", "Thank you Christina.  Our strong first quarter results are driven by Western Union\u2019s geographic diverse revenue stream, strong brand, extensive global distribution and our ability to serve our customer\u2019s ever growing need to transfer money.  Just last month I had the opportunity to attend our Asia Pacific agent conference in Bangkok and to tour the international markets where I met with many agents and employees.  I continue to be optimistic about the tremendous international growth opportunities.  ", "On this trip I toured two markets, the United Arab Emirates and India where there are great market opportunities.  For example, UAE has slightly fewer than 1 million citizens but well over 4 million ex patriots who are employed in the oil, service, construction and other industries.  In fact, the UAE is home to 16% of the world\u2019s large construction cranes.  And just the Gulf areas have nearly 14 million ex patriots.  While there I visited a Western Union location that is conveniently located close to where many ex patriots live.  This one location alone does over 25,000 transactions per month.  With our 345,000 locations, the strength of our brand, I firmly believe Western Union is well positioned, not just in the UAE but also in every major corridor around the globe.  ", "Revenue for the first quarter grew 12% to $1.27 billion or 9% excluding $33 million from the translation of the Euro.  Transaction fee revenue which makes up over 80% of company revenue grew 10%, reflecting consistent transaction and pricing trends in both the money transfer and bill payment businesses.  For 2008, we continue to expect C to C price decreases to be approximately 3% of total Western Union revenue.  Foreign exchange revenue which is generated from the difference between the exchange rate we make available to our customers and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire foreign currencies grew 26%.  ", "Foreign exchange revenue is 17% of total company revenue and is driven by our international business.  Our first quarter operating income margin was 24.4% as reported or 26.3% excluding the $24 million of restructuring expenses.  Last year\u2019s first quarter operating margin was 26.9%.  For year over year comparative purposes, the following items impacted our margins: the restructuring expenses and product mix shifts within our C to B businesses.  Accordingly, our operating income margin was in line with our expectations for the quarter.  We continue to expect full year 2008 operating income margin excluding the total of $69 million in restructuring expenses to be consistent with last year\u2019s margin of 27%.  ", "Also consistent with our historical pattern, we expect operating income margin excluding restructuring expenses in the second half of this year will be higher than the first half of the year.  In the first quarter, we executed restructuring actions that will improve profitability and resulted in $24 million in restructuring expense.  The $24 million was comprised of two components: $17 million from the decision to close our facilities in Texas and Missouri and to transition the operations to existing facilities outside the US as well as to third party providers.  ", "This is part of the $60 million related to the facility closures we announced on March 20th.  And in separate actions, $7 million related to the elimination or relocation of possessions to our Costa Rica operating center and to third party providers.  In January we told you that we expected $5 million in restructuring expense, however in February we identified additional positions to be eliminated or relocated which resulted in an additional $2 million of expense.  Of the $24 million, $22 million was included in costs of services and $2 million was included in SG&A.  The restructuring expenses were not allocated to the operating segments.  ", "For the full year 2008, we expect to have a total of $69 million of restructuring expenses from these actions which includes $60 million from the Texas and Missouri facility closure and $9 million from the positions we identified in the first quarter.  We recognized $7 million of this in the first quarter and will recognize the additional $2 million in the second quarter.  As a result of these initiatives, we expect to achieve expense savings of approximately $10 million this year and over $30 million annually in 2009 and beyond.  ", "And while it is too early to provide specific items for 2009, we expect that these savings and other initiatives will enable us to deliver operating income margin expansion of up to 50 basis points in 2009.  It is also important to note that we have transition plans in place to continue to provide strong service to our customers and agents.  Currently the Texas and Missouri operations handle our settlement functions, about 20% of our domestic customer calls and none of our international customer calls.  On a personal note, I want to echo what Christina said, these decisions impact our employees lives and we do not take them lightly.  Cost of services grew 17% in the quarter and was 60% of first quarter revenue.  Excluding $22 million of restructuring expenses, cost of services grew 14% and was 58% of revenue.  ", "Growth in costs of services which is primarily agent commissions is attributable to the faster growing international C to C business and the mix shift in the C to B segment.  SG&A in the quarter grew 10% excluding $2 million of restructuring expense, SG&A grew 9%.  The tax rate in the quarter was 29.2% compared to 31.5% in the first quarter of 2007.  As expected, the tax rate in the first quarter was lower primarily as a result of increased foreign derived profits which are taxed at lower rates compared to US derived profits.  And within our foreign derived profits, a higher proportion of those earned in lower tax jurisdictions.  ", "We\u2019ll continue to expect a full year tax rate of 29%.  We earned $0.29 per share in the first quarter excluding the restructuring expenses, an increase of 16% or $0.27 per share as reported an increase of 8%.  We continue to generate strong cash flows.  Cash flows from operations was $318 million in the first quarter and has us well on our way towards our goal of $1.2 billion of cash flows in 2008.  We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion or our balance sheet.  Our cash flow generation combined with our significant cash balances gives us great flexibility in executing our business plan.  ", "Moreover, our business does not require significant capital for day to day operations.  In fact, total capital expenditures for 2008 are projected to be less than $200 million.  In the first quarter, capital expenditures were $23 million.  So in combining our high cash balances, our ongoing cash flow generation against relatively low capital expenditures, we have the ability to invest back into business while still returning immediate value to our shareholders through stock repurchases.  In the first quarter we bought back 14 million shares for $297 million at an average price of $21.41.  ", "Since being public, we have repurchased over $1 billion of our stock.  At quarter end we had $956 million remaining for purchases under our current Board authorization.  Taking a deeper look at some of the highlights for the quarter, our C to C segment which is over 80% of total revenue had revenue and transaction growth of 14% in the first quarter driven by the strength of our international business.  Operating income increased 15% and operating margin was 25.9% which is up 10 basis points compared to last year\u2019s first quarter operating margin of 25.8%.  ", "Our total international consumer to consumer business grew revenue and transactions by 19% during the first quarter.  The subset of our international C to C business, those transactions that originate outside the US and total more than 50% of Western Union\u2019s revenue and 80% of total international C to C revenue grew revenue 28% and transactions 29% in the first quarter.  Operating income margin for the international business was higher than the first quarter 2007 and remained strong in the mid 20\u2019s.  In our Mexico business, first quarter revenue growth was 1% on transaction growth of 2%.  Revenue and transaction growth continue to converge as we have anniversaried the price reductions we made in the first quarter of 2007.  ", "Our domestic business which represents 10% of total Western Union revenue showed declines as expected of 8% and 3% in revenue and transactions respectively.  On the revenue line, this is a sequential improvement over the last four quarters.  Also since pricing has been stable for a year now, the different between revenue and transaction growth rates has narrowed to about 500 basis points.  The consumer to business segment which represents 15% of our total revenue grew revenue 4% during the first quarter on transaction growth of 3%.  ", "As you will recall, we have anniversaried our Pago Facil acquisition so these growth rates are organic.  Operating income was down 8% and this quarter\u2019s operating margin of 29.6% was consistent with the last two quarters.  Last year\u2019s first quarter margin was 33.4%, the operating profit and margin were impacted by the ongoing product mix shift from the cash bill payment services to electronic.  For 2008, our revenue, cash flow from operations and capital expenditures guidance is unchanged from what we\u2019ve provided in January.  Revenue growth is expected to be 9-11%, we expect to generate cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion and we expect our capital expenditures to be less than $200 million.  ", "We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.29 excluding $69 million of restructuring expenses which is equivalent to $0.06 per share.  This range also includes the anticipated cost savings of $0.01 per share achieved from the 2008 restructuring activity.  This is a growth of 11% to 14% from last year\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.13.  On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $1.19 to $1.23 including the $0.06 impact from the $69 million of restructuring expenses and a $0.01 benefit from the $10 million in estimated cost savings from the 2008 restructuring activities.  ", "For clarity, our previous GAAP guidance for 2008 earnings per share was a range of $1.24 to $1.28 and included $5 million or less than $0.005 per share in operating expense.  That amount is now being included in the $69 million of total restructuring as we\u2019ve decided to treat all the restructuring expenses together given their size.  The first quarter was strong on the top and bottom lines.  In particular, we again saw the strength of our international business in driving revenue and earnings.  ", "We also took some important cost saving actions in the first quarter that will help improve our margins in 2009.  Margin expansion is an important objective for Western Union.  In 2008 we expect to generate strong cash flows which gives us the flexibility to execute against our stated priorities for the use of cash.  These priorities are to grow the business, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders, primarily through stock buyback.  In summary, we had a great start to the year, we are confident in the state of the business and our 2008 objectives and we are well positioned in the global markets.  Heather, with that we are now ready to take the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions).  Your first question comes from the line of Liz Grausam with Goldman Sachs, please proceed.", "Liz Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, thanks.  I wanted to touch on the margin goals that you outlined for 2009, with 50 basis points of expansion now in your plans.  The first time we\u2019ve heard from you a commitment to margin expansion in the business but it sounds like it\u2019s fairly focused within the restructuring initiative that you laid out, could you help us understand your perspective on the inherent or natural margin expansion available in this network as a result of your brand strength and network breadth in this industry and when we may see really the kind of natural leverage in this business to start to reemerge and if that\u2019s contingent on really the US recovering in any time period.", "Christina Gold", "", "Thanks Liz, I would just say a couple of things here then I\u2019ll pass it on to Scott but I think that even as you look at the C to C business in the first quarter you saw a margin expansion by 10 basis points so we are already starting to see the impact of that international positioning and growth of that network and the strength and really the size of international as it relates to our business.  ", "As we look to our target for 09, 50 basis points is really looking at the restructuring we\u2019re doing and the commitment to give that back to shareholders but it doesn\u2019t preclude what we\u2019re already seeing in the business as we look at leveraging just the size of the brand and the scope of the business.  And Scott I don\u2019t know if you wanted to put a little more on that.", "Scott Scheirman", "", "Yeah, what I would add to that Liz is that there\u2019s a number of avenues for margin expansion and management is very focused on improving our margins up to 50 basis points in 2009.  Some of those items that will be helpful as we move towards margin expansion is our international margins we continue to gain scale there, leveraging our global footprint, the first quarter 08 margins were better than the first quarter 07 margins and those are running in the mid 20\u2019s and we continue to see margin expansion opportunities there.  ", "We took some actions in the first quarter, some restructuring actions and we\u2019ll continue to make sure we have the most effective and efficient cost structure as a global company.  There\u2019s opportunities to continue to improve the profitability of Vigo.  We\u2019ve taken actions there in 07 and continued to drive to improve the profitability of Vigo.  And then as Christina mentioned is really an opportunity to optimize our investments, whether it\u2019s marketing or pricing to ensure that each dollar of investment we even get a better and better return as we put those investments out there.  So, we continue to see a road map to drive strong margins and improving margins up to 50 basis points in 2009.", "Liz Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And could you give us a sense of the scope of what you would consider your investment budget to support your mobile initiatives, micro-lending initiatives, a lot of new business lines, business to business that you\u2019re getting into, I mean is that a substantial amount, expense account that you have running through your P&L now and when do you expect to start seeing at least some returns on those investments from a revenue standpoint?", "Christina Gold", "", "I would not say its substantial, I think it\u2019s part of our total overall marketing budget.  And I don\u2019t think as we\u2019ve talked about, mobile, that\u2019s a three to five year horizon, so we don\u2019t see that really having a great impact on the top or the bottom line at this point.  We really are in a learning phase at this point, so we are investing to make sure we have the right technology and the right marketing to attract customers and drive both the lending and the mobile, but it\u2019s early days yet and as we see more and learn more, we\u2019ll certainly share all that information with you.", "Liz Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Charlie Murphy with Morgan Stanley, please proceed.", "", "Charlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Thank you, Christina and Scott I was wondering if we could discuss the potential for lowering agent commissions particularly in domestic and Mexico business, how do you think about that?  Is there the potential to do that and if you could just discuss that, that would be great.", "Christina Gold", "", "I think as we look at agent commissions around the world, it\u2019s pretty stable.  One of the things that we have focused on in the last period of time is looking at the receive markets of the world because there is a differential in international and we have been able to reduce some of the commission rates as we have resigned agents, clearly because they have seen the value of the brand, they now have a much larger business, a much larger scale and so it\u2019s much more complex negotiations.  ", "So there\u2019s opportunities there, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re always looking at and as we always say, we look for opportunity but we also are very conscious of the profitability of our deals, making sure that it is good for the company and good for the agent.

I think we have seen from some competitors in the US, you know willing to take a pretty aggressive stand in terms of what they want to pay and we\u2019ve not been willing to go to that extent.  Clearly also there\u2019s a lot of competitive nature in our Vigo agent relationship so that\u2019s a different part of our model which we really don\u2019t discuss a lot but we also look at that and we have different commission rates there.

I think in the past we\u2019ve discussed the fact that the international businesses have had lower margins because of the different super agent and agent structure and I was kind of wondering if as the international continues to outpace the domestic growth, I mean the fact that you\u2019re proposing to increase margins is in fact a stronger operation performance given the margin going against you.", "Christina Gold", "", "I think as we see our margins in our international business as we gain scale and also we\u2019ve done negotiations on agent commissions, we\u2019ve seen that margin expansion so that it is in the mid 20s and actually first quarter international margins were stronger than first quarter internationals last year.  So we are leveraging that.  We\u2019re also leveraging the cost structure because we build the infrastructure in the countries and now as we gain scale, so we obviously as we went through some of the very rough time in 06 when we had that very, you know drop in the US and then the very high surgance of international that had a real tough impact on our margins but over time we see our margins really lining up in a more consistent pattern and Scott you know can give you a little more color on that.", "Scott Scheirman", "", "Yeah, Frank it\u2019s continuing in the international business, those are mid 20 margins, those have been improving and it\u2019s our ability to leverage our scale and our global footprint as we built presence in Asia Pacific, built presence in Europe, Asia, Eastern Europe and so forth, so we\u2019re leveraging that scale in able to affectively drive more dollars to the bottom line as we do that.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair & Company", "One other question for you Scott, on the consumer to business side, can you, I remember the product mix shift but can you give us or maybe remind us of some of the factors that are affecting margins there and where should we expect that to kind of stabilize out?", "Scott Scheirman", "", "The margins this quarter were right at 30% and that\u2019s been consistent with the last couple of quarters if you look at the latter half of 2007.

Like in India, $27 billion, it\u2019s probably more like $37 or $40 billion once we count sort of the underground.  And that\u2019s really the biggest competitor that we have.

My question is on the restructuring, was the $69 million of expenses, over some period of time would you expect the cost savings to actually be greater than the $30 million in 09 since you do mention more than $30 million in the press release.", "Scott Scheirman", "You know, clearly that\u2019s our goal is to drive as much savings as possible but still providing the right service and the right efficiency in our operations but we\u2019ll continue to focus on that, we will incur $69 million and our best view right now is that 2009 annually will have savings of over $30 million, but we\u2019ll try to work that hard.", "Patrick Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "Am I misreading then that you\u2019re cutting out $69 million of expenses or is that what it\u2019s costing you to go through the severance.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yeah the $69 million is the cost of the restructuring so that\u2019s severance, there\u2019s some fixed assets, some leaseholds I\u2019ve got to write off and then there\u2019s some expense of training we want to do to make sure we\u2019ve got a smooth transition and a solid plan there which we have.  So the $69 million is the cost of the restructuring, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll incur.", "Patrick Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay and there is new training costs and things like that imbedded in the number.", "Scott Scheirman", "Absolutely.", "Patrick Burton \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Greg Smith with Merrill Lynch, please proceed.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, hi, good morning.  I don\u2019t think I saw or did you say that Mexico as a percentage of total revenues?", "Christina Gold", "", "We didn\u2019t say but it continues to be about 7% of our revenues, so India and China are now at 6, so they\u2019re almost equal.  And it probably will surpass.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Some rounding maybe we\u2019ll get there next quarter?", "Christina Gold", "", "Yeah, we\u2019ll work on it.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "And then in the US to Mexico quarter are you seeing competitors retrenching and actually shutting down branches?", "Christina Gold", "", "You know we\u2019re seeing a lot of different activity, we have seen some of that because of obviously the issues in the business.  We see a stable environment as it relates to the pricing and also to the spreads, it\u2019s pretty stable.  Some of the things that we\u2019re also seeing is we\u2019re seeing movement of customers to different parts of the country and even to Canada we\u2019re seeing very strong growth to Mexico and Canada was up 58%.  Canada to Mexico, so our customers are on the move and if they can\u2019t find a job in one city they\u2019ll move to another or to another country.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Great, any idea where that Canada to Mexico was say two years ago or a year ago offhand?", "Christina Gold", "", "It wasn\u2019t 58%.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "And then in the domestic C to C business, obviously you have the dot-com weighing you down some but outside of that, is sort of dragging on growth, is it more you know I think I ask this a lot, but is it a secular trend, people just using alternative methods more or is it just more just the same issue at immigrants effecting you.", "Christina Gold", "", "I think that particular business has been impacted the most in terms of what we look at in terms of the economy right now and housing and construction.  But also what we have done is we are doing some things right now in terms of investing in our loyalty programs and also doing some media in that particular segment.  But we have focused more of our investments in the high growth markets because we recognize that there are some issues in this market.  We don\u2019t expect a big turnaround in 2008, it\u2019s going to be pretty consistent, a little bit better, stabilizing that business but that business longer term, we don\u2019t see it as growing more than 3-5%, so this is not going to be a big driver of growth.  So therefore we focus our resources on the growth engines of the company.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yup, great, okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Next question is from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer, please proceed.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Thank you, good morning.  A couple questions on international, I was wondering if you could talk about the convergence of the transaction of revenue growth of 19% sort of been converging for the last couple quarters and actually sort of got to parity this quarter.  Is it an anomaly or is this kind of sustainable going forward?", "Christina Gold", "", "You know it\u2019s great to see, we\u2019re delighted to see that.  The spreads of the transaction revenue, I mean obviously we got a little bit of a lift from the Euro but I think the other thing is what we\u2019re seeing is our brand and our network and the pricing is relatively stable so we\u2019re not seeing a lot of movement on that front and we said about 3%, so I think that this is something that we hope going forward would stay within that particular range.  Because the power of the brand and the stability of the pricing.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "You did sort of affirm the 3% price hit for the year but all in for the quarter, not only the international but all in you look pretty flat.  So does that suggest sort of things will get somewhat worse in the back three quarters of the year or sort of being conservative at this point?", "Christina Gold", "", "I think when we look at any year you never know what\u2019s coming so what we try to do is look at it as all of the quarters that we have 15-20,000 corridors, our plans are set at the beginning of the year so this is what the team has put together for 08 so we fell it\u2019ll be around 3%.  It\u2019s not, it\u2019s really a question of timing and it\u2019s a question of [semis] on spreads and things like that but we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re in a stable sort of steady as we go environment.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "And that portion of international that was originated outside the US, that 50% of revenue that grew in the high 20\u2019s, you know that obviously accelerated this quarter, is that largely driven by India China or some other dynamic there?", "Christina Gold", "", "You know it\u2019s driven by the whole world because we have such a great network, not at 345,000 locations but India and China are growing but remember they\u2019re only 6% of our revenues, so it\u2019s really all elements of the business are functioning well.  As I said earlier, the UK is up 29%, we see our Middle Eastern business from the UAE with the growth that\u2019s going on there, because we have such a strong brand and such a strong network we\u2019re getting fired up and powered all over the world and our teams are on the ground making sure that we capture that business in every part of the globe.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "And then just finally, how meaningful do you think South Africa will be to your results this year?", "Christina Gold", "", "I think in 08 it will not really be a substantial amount because that will be rolling that out later in the year, it\u2019s a very careful rollout in terms of what we need to do with the government there and the regulators there so I think that will grow as we get into 09 but in 08 I think it\u2019s not really a meaningful number.  But it\u2019s great news for us.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "Next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray, please proceed.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thank you, good morning.  A couple questions left.  The mobile business, the mobile money transfer business Christina, as you dig into this more, is this looking in your opinion more of a threat to your business model or an opportunity to add onto your business model?  There are a lot of ways this could go over the next several years and it\u2019s very difficult to come up with the right answer from my perspective.", "Christina Gold", "", "I really don\u2019t see it as a threat, I think one of the reasons why we wanted to get involved at the start of this is because this is an opportunity.  We are the money movers of the world so we wanted to connect with the mobile carriers.  What we\u2019ve seen in test is it is a different customer, so that\u2019s an incrementality to us.  So you know it\u2019s a question of like looking at the dynamics in terms of the profitability and this is a high volume business.  So the volume will give us the profitability and then it\u2019s a question of making sure that we can make the costs of doing these transactions you know very efficient.  ", "So I think it\u2019s terrific.  The other thing is that in some countries we don\u2019t do inter-country transactions, so let\u2019s say India or China, we don\u2019t do transactions around India or around China, we can only go into India.  This now gives us the door to intra-country which we don\u2019t have an so that to me is a whole new incremental business because if you think of the domestic US business which is about 10% of our business, imagine what that would mean in India or China, how big that could be for us.  So to me this is, it\u2019s all a win-win, it\u2019s a question of learning and working with the carriers to really make this work for our business.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great, thank you, that\u2019s very helpful.  The price, your goal I think over the long term, part of your model has been a 3% price decrease and I mean we see some global inflation maybe and as your pricing has come down over the last couple of years, do you still see that 3% price decrease or are you starting to look more like prices will flatten out?", "Christina Gold", "", "Well one of the things that we\u2019re working on very diligently right now is really looking at our value proposition, so some of it is looking at the pricing and saying what are we going to add in from royalties so that price is not the solution for everything as we look at the competition. But it\u2019s also using Vigo and our other brands more effectively.  You know we\u2019re moving Vigo into Europe so now we will have a different brand to lever for other customers that are more price sensitive, so that will give us a balancing act that we can really manage our business more effectively.  ", "So it\u2019s really, the pricing strategy is not just about Western Union, but it\u2019s taking our three brands and looking at how do we maximize the opportunity in each customer segment and make it work so that we gain share of business but maintain a good solid profitability level.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great, then last question, obviously one of your big competitors has had some serious problems, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any benefits from the competitive shakeup and challenges that your competitor has?", "Christina Gold", "", "You know I think as an industry you never like to see that happen in an industry because it always doesn\u2019t reflect well on anyone in an industry because it does make people concerned.  But I think from our perspective we\u2019ve always been very competitive looking at not only the opportunities for customers and pricing but also for the network.  And this quarter we added Bank Pekao which is the largest bank in Poland to our network which was a take away from competitors.  So I think there are some opportunities there that we will continue to explore.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thank you for taking the questions and nice quarter.", "Gary Kohn", "", "Heather at this point we have time for one more question please.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan, please proceed.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, good morning and nice quarter as well.  A few questions, first on C to C foreign exchange revenues which were up sharply I think at 26%, should we expect that trend to continue, it looks like it\u2019s well above that of international revenue growth and transaction growth.", "Scott Scheirman", "", "Yeah, I would say that trend is really factored into our guidance of the 9-11% on a full year basis and that\u2019ll be one component of our revenue growth for 2008.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Is that trend driven beyond what we\u2019re seeing in terms of currency dynamics?", "Scott Scheirman", "", "Well there\u2019s a little bit of currency dynamic in there but, and you said it earlier, it\u2019s really tied to our international, we had tremendous international growth in this quarter and so as we\u2019ve had international growth that also drives the foreign currency.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, very good and then in domestic and Mexico C to C, what kind of average ticket trends and how is this impacting the spread between revenue and transaction growth?", "Scott Scheirman", "", "I think you\u2019re referring to principle per transaction is what you\u2019re looking for?  On an overall global basis we\u2019re seeing our principle per transaction up slightly, so consumers are sending a little bit more money.  We\u2019re seeing that in Mexico too.  In our domestic business the principle per transaction is just down slightly, but on a global basis it\u2019s up.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, very good and then lastly just to clarify the 50 BPs in margin expansion in 08, is that limited to 09 or can we expect some expansion beyond that?  Meaning beyond fiscal 09 because I heard a lot of commentary about C to B getting better and commissions et cetera, so and then in the past you\u2019ve talked about margins being relatively flat, so is there any reason to think that we can expect margin expansion starting in 010 and beyond?", "Scott Scheirman", "", "What I\u2019ll share with you, management is very focused on profitability and expanding our margins and in 2009 we\u2019ve got the objective of you know after a 50 basis points increase, so we\u2019re going to be very focused on driving profitability and improving profitability as we move forward, but our line of sight right now is through 2009 and that\u2019s the objective of up to 50 basis points in 2009.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Great, very good, thanks again.", "Christina Gold", "", "I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for joining us this morning.  We are very excited about the quarter but more importantly we\u2019re excited about 2008 and what we see before us.  We\u2019re very confident in the year and in terms of what we can achieve and our customers are also very resilient in making sure that they\u2019re moving around the globe, sending money home and really helping to drive our business.  And a thank you to all of our agents and to our employees for a great quarter and I look forward to seeing all of you in June at our conference.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Gary Kohn, Vice President of Investor Relations; please proceed sir.", "Gary Kohn", "Good morning everybody and welcome to the Western Union second quarter 2008 earnings conference call; thank you for joining us today. As we have indicated in our press release announcing earnings, we have prepared slides to accompany this conference call and webcast. These slides are available at www.westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab. The slides will remain available after the call for your convenience and reference. ", "Before turning the call over to Christina, I will take a moment to remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward-looking statements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2007 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Other than the replay, Western Union does not authorize and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call. ", "With that it is my great pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "Good morning everyone, the geographic diversity we have built in our business has once again proven to be a key advantage in delivering results from quarter to quarter that stand out in these challenging economic times. In this past quarter not only did the international business continue to perform well, but we also saw improving trends in the domestic, US outbound and Mexico businesses.", "Revenue was $1.3 billion, up 12% or 9% excluding the $38 million benefit from euro translation. Consumer-to-consumer revenue was up 14% from transaction growth of 13%. Our international business which represents two-thirds of our total revenue posted a 19% increase in revenue and 18% in transactions. The fastest growing part of our business, the sub-set of international transactions that originate outside of the United States grew revenue and transactions 26%. This sub-set represented 55% of total revenue in the quarter. ", "Domestic revenue declined 7% in the quarter; the rate of decline has moderated by about 300 basis points from second quarter 2007. And the Mexico business achieved 3% revenue growth on 1% transaction growth reflecting the stable pricing environment. We also continued to outpace the market growth as reported by Banco de Mexico. ", "On the topic of Mexico I know many of your read about the recent court opinion in Arizona. We were disappointed with the opinion. With that said this is one step in a lengthy legal process and we will pursue all avenues available to us including the appeal we will file later this week. ", "Within the C2C business we are very pleased that pricing decreases are running favorable to our plan, in fact we expect C2C pricing reductions to be about 2% of total revenue this year versus our plan of 3%. Excluding the $23 million of restructuring expenses we earned $0.33 per share, a 27% increase over the same quarter last year. Reported EPS was $0.31 a share, an increase of 19%. ", "The business continues to perform in a predictable manner driving consistent first half results giving us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2008 goals. As important as the results so far this year, is our confidence in the long-term. As we shared with you during our Investor Conference on June 20, we believe Western Union is well positioned to continue to build shareholder value in the long-term. ", "Migration trends remain strong and remittances are growing. Our strengths have put us in a unique position to capitalize on the opportunity. We enjoy a leading position in the huge money transfer market. As the [IAT] research shows the cross-border money transfer remittance market is estimated to be $400 billion this year and continues to expand on average 8% annually. Our remittance principal has consistently grown over 20% annually and as a result our market share continues to grow.", "We have developed an unmatched distribution network of 355,000 agent locations. We have built one of the most well known brands. Western Union translates to trust, speed and reliability to customers the world over. We have a globally diverse revenue stream with more then half of our revenue originating outside the US. We have all the advantages of scale and the ability to leverage our infrastructure. ", "We have a first class compliance program and enjoy strong relationships with regulators around the world. We are in a solid financial position. Our prudent policies have helped us maintain strong credit ratings and give us flexibility to invest in our future. And of course it is the energy and hard work of our employees and agents who possess great local knowledge that make the organization complete.", "These attributes give us the confidence to reiterate our long-term objectives of 10% to 12% revenue growth and 15% to 18% EPS growth. We introduced our four growth priorities in January and provided more details a few weeks ago. The priorities were developed to best align our resources to the opportunities. They are sound and we\u2019ll continue to execute on them.", "Our first priority is to grow the C2C business. We continue to grow the core business through the expansion of our global footprint. In the quarter we added 10,000 agent locations to bring the network to more then 355,000. Our locations across 200 countries and territories cover the most urban to the most rural spots on the globe making Western Union one of the most convenient service providers in the world. ", "We continually sign new agents and extend existing relationships as agents look to partner with Western Union so they can be a part of our extensive network and benefit from our compliance expertise, as well as the customer base our world class brand brings. In the past quarter I travelled to many countries to welcome new agents and to celebrate extensions of existing relationships.", "To highlight just a few, in Asia Pacific we added two outstanding agents. One was Bank Danamon, a leading Indonesian bank. This was a competitive take-away. And the other was the Agricultural Promotion Bank in Laos. In our EMEA South Asia region we renewed our relationship with the State Bank of India which has extensive rural coverage with more then 4,700 locations. We signed a multi year agreement at more advantageous commission rates with our long standing agent, The First Bank of Nigeria.", "We added the Sri Lanka Post where we expect to begin service in more then 600 of their 4,000 locations this year. And we added Pubali-Bank in Bangladesh with more then 400 locations. Additionally after making an equity investment in Grace Kennedy in 2007 we worked with them to expand our footprint in the UK. And we are now better positioned to serve the large UK to Jamaica corridor.", "In the Americas region we had many signings and exciting renewals. In the US we renewed our relationship with two of our largest check cashing groups; PLS Check Cashers and Multi State Financial Services. And in Brazil we renewed our agreement with Banco de Brazil for five more years adding to our 10 year successful relationship. The renewal structure will further increase our margin and allows us to sign other agents in Brazil.", "Other highlights in the C2C segment this quarter included on the customer loyalty and relationship front, we continued to provide unique features for our customers and have launched an auto notification pilot that brings the value-added service of notifying the receiver that a transaction is ready to be picked up and notifies the sender that funds have been paid out. At quarter-end we had 10 million Gold Card members. For the full year we expect C2C pricing reductions to be around 2% of total revenue versus 3% as previously expected.", "We had a successful Mother\u2019s Day in Mexico which is very key for us and it is important to note that last year\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day was strong as well. We saw improving trends within our westernunion.com business. Dot com posted positive revenue and transaction growth for the first time in five quarters driven by improvements in the US and continued international strength. In our Vigo expansion effort we added 3,000 receive locations in Russia and the Ukraine. ", "Our second priority is to expand our C2B business to other countries through joint ventures, acquisitions, and Pago Facil expansion. We are driving hard to bring Pago Facil to additional countries and we have made significant progress and are on-plan to offer bill payment services in Peru later this year. We are also on track to begin offering Vigo branded bill payments in the United States on a test basis in the fourth quarter. Acquisitions remain a key component of our C2B growth plans and we have a good pipeline. ", "Our third priority is to drive innovation by developing new services and technologies. The mobile pilot we launched in the first quarter with Smart Communications and Globe Telecom continues for transactions between Hawaii and The Philippines. We believe mobile financial offerings provide an attractive opportunity in the coming three to five years. We are in discussions with major mobile operators around the globe and we will have several announcements in the near future.", "Our micro lending pilot remains on track. We and our partner Prime Credit, a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank are encouraged by the results so far and we will be sharing more with you as this pilot moves forward. Another key priority is our focus on improving profitability. We are committed to delivering 2008 operating margin excluding restructuring expenses consistent with 2007 at around 27%. Additionally we are taking steps to ensure we deliver up to 50 basis points of margin improvement next year.", "These steps have included relocating several functions to operating centers in Costa Rica. I together with members of the senior management team visited our new facilities in Costa Rica and I am very proud to report that everything is on track. The new Western Union team members are energized and up to the task. I want to thank them as well as the rest of the team involved in making these transitions seamless. And this has been no small undertaking. ", "In the second quarter we took another step to improve our cost structure through our decision to close our operating facility in San Francisco and relocate the functions to existing US facilities and to third party outsourcers. Regardless of the economic environment we strive to run this business as efficiently as possible while maintaining our commitment to providing our customers and agents the highest level of service. ", "Ours is a scalable business and we have as an objective to deliver long-term margin expansions as we not only pursue cost saving initiatives but also leverage our infrastructure in the markets the world over. As we shared on June 20, we have been able to expand margins after we have made the investments for growth over time like in A-Pac and the EMEA South Asia; we have expanded margins as transactions and revenues scale. ", "Our leadership position is a result of our global diversification, our global distribution, our world class brand, geographically balanced portfolio, scalable infrastructure, industry leading compliance capabilities, and our financial position. I have great confidence in our team and our ability to achieve the goals we have set for 2008 and beyond. ", "And now I will turn to Scott Scheirman, our CFO who will discuss our second quarter financial performance and 2008 outlook in greater detail.", "Scott Scheirman ", "Thank you Christina, our leadership position in the global money transfer marketplace and our execution of our growth strategy allowed us to deliver yet another strong predictable quarter of financial results.", "Revenue for the second quarter grew 12% to $1.35 billion excluding $38 million of benefit from the translation of the euro, revenue grew 9%. The profit benefit on the translation of the euro was $5 million. Earnings per share on a reported basis were $0.31 at 19% growth and earnings per share excluding $23 million of restructuring expenses was $0.33, a 27% growth.", "Transaction fee revenue which makes up over 80% of company revenue grew 10% driven by ongoing healthy transaction growth and improving pricing trends. Foreign exchange revenue which is generated from the difference between the exchange rate we make available to our customers and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire foreign currencies grew 25%. Foreign exchange revenue is 17% of total company revenue and is driven by our international business. ", "Second quarter margin was 25.0% as reported or 26.7% excluding $23 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to a 2007 second quarter margin of 26.8%. C2C margin was 70 basis points higher year-over-year as a result of continuing to leverage our scale in the international business. C2B margin was down 380 basis points. The margin was impacted by the ongoing product mix shift from the US, cash bill payment services to electronic. ", "Excluding restructuring expenses we expect full year 2008 Western Union margins to be consistent with margins in 2007. Margins in the second half of the year are estimated to be stronger then in the first half of the year with the fourth quarter having the highest margin. Of the $23 million in second quarter restructuring expenses $20 million was included in cost of services and $3 million was included in SG&A.", "Consistent with the first quarter restructuring expenses were not included in the operating segments. For full year 2008 we expect to have a total of approximately $80 million in restructuring expenses. As a result of these initiatives we estimate expense savings will be $10 million this year and $35 million annually in 2009 and beyond.", "These initiatives and other initiatives will help us deliver margin expansion of up to 50 basis points in 2009. Cost of services grew 16% in the quarter and was 59% of revenue. Excluding $20 million of restructuring expenses cost of services grew 13% and was 58% of revenue which is consistent with first quarter 2008. The growth in cost of services which is primarily agent commissions is attributable to the faster growing international C2C business and the mix shift in the C2B segments.", "SG&A in the quarter grew 10%. Excluding $3 million of restructuring expenses, SG&A grew 8%. The tax rate in the quarter was 25% compared to 31% in the second quarter of 2007. The tax rate was lower primarily as a result of increased foreign derived profits which are taxed at lower rates compared to US derived profits and within the foreign derived profits a higher proportion of those being earned in even lower tax countries.", "Additionally this lower tax rate is due to the finalization and implementation of foreign tax strategies that will drive sustainable cash benefits this year and annually going forward. As a result of our strategies and with the international profits growing faster then the US profits, we now expect a full year tax rate of 26.5%, an improvement from our previous estimate of 29%.", "The 26.5% tax rate is calculated on our expected full year GAAP pre-tax profit. In updating your models please keep in mind that when you exclude the restructuring expenses the effective tax rate is 27.5%. Lower tax rates are a real cash benefit to Western Union.

In the second quarter capital expenditures were $57 million bringing the total for the first half of the year to $80 million. In the quarter capital expenditures included signing bonuses, which were part of the capital expenditures guidance for the year. We still anticipate total capital expenditures to be less then $200 million in 2008 or about 17% of cash flow from operations.", "When considering our high cash balances, our ongoing cash flow generation and our relatively low capital needs, it is clear that we have the ability to invest back in the business while returning immediate value to our shareholders through stock buyback. In the quarter we bought back 17 million for $385 million at an average price of $23.32. Since being public we have repurchased $1.4 billion or 66 million shares of our stock at an average price of $21.65. Last month The Board authorized an additional $1 billion for stock buyback.

Within the region our domestic money transfer business benefited from moderating declines in the US westernunion.com business.

The Asia Pacific regions represents a huge opportunity for us and as to date only comprises a small percentage of our total revenue but includes large remittance markets like China and The Philippines. Asia Pacific grew revenue 30% and transactions 25%. China reported 27% revenue growth and 18% transaction growth.", "The consumer-to-business segment which represents 13% of our total revenue grew revenue 3% and transactions 2%. Operating income was down 10% and this quarter\u2019s operating margin of 28% compares to last year\u2019s second quarter margin of 32%. Impacting the year-over-year operating income decline and margin is the declining traditional US cash bill payment business as compared to the faster growing US electronic bill payment and Pago Facil businesses which have lower margins.", "For 2008 our revenue, cash flow from operations, and capital expenditures guidance is unchanged from what we shared on June 20.

Our new guidance for earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses is $1.29 to $1.33 and we expect to likely be at the higher end of this range. We have added $0.04 to our prior guidance of $1.25 to $1.29 to reflect the change in tax rates. ", "Remember as I stated earlier the tax rate on these non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is 27.5%. We now expect GAAP earnings per share of $1.22 to $1.26. This reflects the lower tax rate of 26.5%.

As you saw with the Banco de Brazil we had better financials for us and we are continuing to look at a lot of the receive markets as well as when we sign up new agents, we also have more favorable economics for us. So we feel very good about where that\u2019s going.

But I think also really as we look at our portfolio and our business what we\u2019re really trying to do is add value so that pricing is really the last lever that we pull. We really look at how can we add value through our loyalty programs, sharing in terms of rewards with our agents, looking at other ways to compete. ", "And also as we look at some of the developing markets in the world, as we started to grow those markets we started in a very different competitive position and so we see that 2% being a realistic number for 2008 and we\u2019re delighted to see that and obviously the profitability of our business and the [property] of competitors you can see that there is an important element of profitability for all of us to make this work. ", "Elizabeth Grausam \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is there any effect of having your Gold Card base on the pricing stability that you see in markets as you get users into more of a loyalty business, one where they perhaps have rewards or loyalty points tied to the agent bases in those markets where you can stabilize your own pricing?", "Christina Gold ", "Gail and the team are working in terms of how do we really even more maximize those Gold Cards because we do see that stability. We also in terms of the rewards they don\u2019t necessarily get paid through Western Union but rather to the agents. So that gives us leverage there as well. So it\u2019s really a win-win situation for us.

I think we\u2019ve always been targeted in terms of looking at what are the networks available out there and clearly with the results that we bring and the locations that we have, the competitors are looking in terms of the agents coming to us because they see not only the brand but the locations, the networks and also the compliance capabilities.

I would tell you that the jumping off point and its too early to give 2009 guidance but I would probably focus you on the non-GAAP tax rate of 27.5% as a starting point and then we believe that tax rate can continue to move down over the next three to five years as the international business will likely grow faster then the US business.

The international rate is substantially lower then that and it all factors into our long-term objective where we\u2019re growing earnings per share at 15% to 18%, but a lower tax rate will be helpful and one of the elements in addition to expanding margins as we move forward to drive strong growth of 15% to 18% earnings per share.

But as we look at the marketplace right now we feel 2% is what we\u2019re going to need for 2008. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "So commission economics would be incremental to the 2% if we want to think about that longer term?", "Christina Gold", "Well not necessarily, it\u2019ll be the same percentage that it would always be because there\u2019s a sharing percentage that\u2019s always existed with the agents so it\u2019s not as though they\u2019re going to have more or less because when you take pricing down, then their revenue goes down as well.

Our customer is a cash based individual who goes to countries to search out work, to send money home. This is not a credit card person, doesn\u2019t have a house, really is kind of strapped and they are challenged. So it\u2019s a very mobile person so what we would see\u2014sometimes we can see is perhaps the principal being a little less but as we looked at some of the challenges we face around the globe, and you see it, you can see changes in principal but we can manage that through moving prices to drive transactions or investments in other parts of the world where we see\u2014like in The Middle East we see a lot of people going into The Middle East so we\u2019re driving that business very hard. A couple of years ago it was really a [inaudible] business and we really didn\u2019t understand it now we have a team there that does a phenomenal job and we drive a very big chunk of business out of there.

But as that economy is now picking up they\u2019re starting to build infrastructure in different parts of Eastern Europe so all of a sudden now we have corridors from Poland to Vietnam, Poland to China; they\u2019re bringing in migrants because they lack the labor force to do the work. So it\u2019s very important for us to identify new trends, new opportunities and continue to market and build those corridors and so its really a balancing act but I feel confident that we have the people on the ground and the intelligence on the ground to maneuver our investments to make sure we continue to see that growth.

And also a 26% for our international outside of the US growth rate is tremendous and also seeing very strong growth rates in our subset as well.

But the other thing is we showed to investors at the meeting in June, as the Asia and the EMEA have scaled they\u2019ve gone into the 20s and mid 20s so we\u2019ve seen that scale as we built the awareness, built the network, we really do see margin expansion in our markets.

I believe in certain areas we\u2019re reaching an inflection point where we continue to drive margin expansion and then there will be some opportunities to improve our cost structure. The actions we took this year, difficult actions, but $80 million of expense but annually we\u2019ll save $35 million beginning in 2009.

So it takes a little while for some of that to roll through and I think the other thing is on the 50 basis points we wanted to at the time we took the restructuring charge was to clarify also that we would take the charge but that we would give back to investors the 50 basis points. So we\u2019re still targeting to do more if we can, but we\u2019re not committed yet to 2009 except for the 50 basis points which we\u2019ve already given. ", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "But is the 50 basis points\u2014is there a meaningful contribution from the agent commission rates or--?", "Christina Gold", "In that no I would say no, not there no. You add that separate. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "With regards to Western Union taking over the management of the settlement assets on the money orders, what\u2019s the reasoning behind that? I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve heard why you\u2019re actually doing that?", "Scott Scheirman", "When we first spun off from for First Data, they did the processing of that and as we went public time just didn\u2019t permit necessarily to do that. We\u2019re getting the licenses we need and other things we need to do that. And then money order is an important business to us. We sell that in over 50,000 locations. Two-thirds of our money transfer agents in the US offer that so it\u2019s strategically important. And since spin-off we run the sales and marketing arm of that and now starting in October through 2010 we\u2019ll have full management of that business and that product.  ", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "So will you potentially get more aggressive in growing that business, hopefully not more aggressive in how you manage the money, but in actually growing it?", "Scott Scheirman", "No we will be aggressive in managing the money by no means. We\u2019ll get cash of $800 million and we will invest that wisely just as we have with the money transfer business. Without being too helpful to my competitors out there, money order is important and we\u2019ll continue to drive growth behind that. ", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "With some of your office closures and moving call centers and whatnot, it sounds like you are increasingly using third party outsourcers just want to get an update on how that\u2019s going and are you getting service levels and whatnot that you hoped for?", "Christina Gold", "We are really quite pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. Obviously it was a difficult decision but its one where we were very well planned and we have a large operation in Costa Rica. We actually have over 1,000 employees there now so the bulk of the work, a large chunk of it is being done by our employees in Costa Rica and other parts of The Philippines and other parts of the world. The outsources that we\u2019ve used we had been using them over a period of time and we have very strict in terms of SLAs and what we expect so the service there is very good. As we\u2019ve gone through this transition we really have not skipped a beat as it relates to service and our expectations are high and the performance of our centers and the outsources have been very good. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Charles Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Charles Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I just wanted to return again to agent commissions, can you give us any sense for in situations where you are adjusting agent commissions how much you\u2019re adjusting them? For example if I was an international agent and I was making 25% of the transaction what will I be making in 2009?", "Christina Gold", "We really don\u2019t disclose the finite details of it but I think the differences are\u2014it depends on the size of the market and the business and kind of whether you\u2019re a receive and the cost structure that the agent has. And we\u2019re cognizant of their profitability and our profitability because we work on both fronts so I think that as we create these advantageous contracts for ourselves we also ensure that we\u2019re going to drive volume through their business so that they also maintain their profitability. So it\u2019s a win-win and we also look at other ways in terms of marketing investment and other things to do that we can do to drive the business with them. ", "Charles Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I noticed that you appointed a new manager in the US Canada business, is it possible to get any early impressions from him or what he will be asked to do?", "Christina Gold", "Obviously we\u2019re delighted that Stewart has joined the company. We were in search for a period of time and I think he brings a lot of marketing expertise to the corporation and we look forward to what he can do for the business and work with the team to drive it forward. So probably over time you will have an opportunity to meet with him and see how his plans are going. But its early days yet, he\u2019s only been with us for about 30 days. ", "", "Thank you very much, appreciate everybody on the call today. Again to all the employees and agents of Western Union thank you for a terrific quarter. We feel confident in our year, we\u2019re confident in our business and we\u2019re just delighted to be able to share the results with you and look forward to next quarter.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call Mr. Gary Kohn, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Gary Kohn", "Welcome to the Western Union Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. As we indicated in our press release we have prepared slides to accompany this call and webcast. These slides are available at www.WesternUnion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call for your convenience.", "Before turning the call over to Christina, I will take a moment to remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward looking statements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in our earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the SEC including the 2007 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements. ", "During the call, we will discuss items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.", "We have reconciled those measures to GAAP measures on our website www.WesternUnion.com under the Investor Relations section. All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay, Western Union does not authorize and in fact disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "With that it is my great pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "We were pleased with our third quarter results with growth of 10% or 8% Euro adjusted and earnings per share of $0.33 up 18% on a GAAP basis and up 10% excluding $3 million of restructuring expenses in the quarter and the $22 million accelerated stock compensation spend charged in 2007. Our continued execution of our strategy and our geographically diverse portfolio kept our business growing profitably in the quarter in what became a more challenging macro economic environment.", "Transaction growth rates held strong and their revenue growth this quarter was solid. Although we did see principal per transaction grow more slowly than previous quarters. Our operating margin was solid at 27.2% or 27.5% excluding restructuring expenses. We earned $0.33 a share this quarter. EPS was impacted by a total of $0.015 from restructuring charges and an increase in the net other expense line from foreign currency hedge losses that resulted from unusual market volatility. Scott will provide more color on this.", "Our cash flow from operations remained strong and we generated $925 million for the nine month period. Our ability to deliver significant cash flows in addition to our strong cash balance at quarter end are major competitive advantages. The financial results we delivered this quarter were the result of the team executing on our four key strategies. Our first priority is to grow the C2C business. We continue to promote and market our brands, grow the agent network, expand our offerings like our intra business and online money transfer and to price effectively to grow our C2C business.", "At the beginning of the year we had planned to implement price decreases this year totaling around 3% of company revenue. We now expect to make price decreases totaling only 1% of revenue. At the end of the third quarter our agent network totaled more than 365,000 locations exceeding our 2008 goal of 360,000. We have agents in every corner of the world serving customers in the most rural to the most urban markets.", "In the past quarter we welcomed new agents and extended relationships with existing agents. To highlight just a few, throughout Asia/Pacific we added the Vietnam post which has nearly 3,000 locations. This is a competitive take away. We plan to open 600 locations this year and an additional 700 next year. ", "In the Philippines we added our first direct bank agent Robinsons Savings Bank. In Malaysia one of the largest banks Public Bank we expect to add 250 locations and in Thailand we added Bangkok Bank, they have over 750 locations, 400 of which have already begun offering Western Union money transfers.", "In our EMEASA region we have officially opened in South Africa with our agent ABSA. In fact, I just returned from a trip to launch this service and I am very excited about the opportunity. We now have agents in nearly 50 countries on the African continent many of whom came the launch in Johannesburg. I can tell you that there was overwhelming enthusiasm among the agents and the Western Union team. In the past South Africa was an important receipt country for Western Union. It has now evolved into a receipt and send market that serves as a hub for a larger Pan/African money transfer opportunity. ", "We renewed our relationship with the French Postal Savings Bank. La Bank Postal is an important agent with whom we have been working with for nearly a decade. In the UK we launched a pilot money transfer program with ASDA a member of the Wal-Mart family. We added National Bank of Greece which is one of the oldest and largest banks in the country with 580 branches and to better serve Qatar our existing agent the UE exchange expanded into the country.", "In the Americas region we acquired 100% of our agent in Panama and assumed direct responsibility for the agent network. This will lower our distribution costs as well as facilitate easier expansion of bill payment offerings.", "Our C2C business was strong and in particular the international C2C business which is 69% of total revenue remained robust with 15% revenue and 19% transaction growth. Importantly, the growth is profitable at international C2C margins continue to expand.", "We introduced a new regional view this year to better highlight our geographic diversity. The Americas region saw revenue flat year over year while transactions grew 1%. This region is 33% of total revenue. Within this region as expected pricing in Mexico remained stable and we once again performed better than the statistics reported by the Banco de Mexico. Mexico\u2019s revenue and transactions declined 1% and 4% respectively. Our domestic business continued to improve with revenue down 3% which is the lowest rate of decline we have experienced in the last nine quarters. Transactions were down 1%.", "Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region is 45% of total revenue and posted revenue growth of 20% with 27% transaction growth. This region includes a variety of geographic corridors with each having its own growth characteristics. Some Western European markets saw revenue growth slow sequentially from the second quarter. For example, some of our customers in Spain have felt the impact from the slumping housing industry and the rise in unemployment. As a result, we have seen transaction growth slow.", "Other markets have stronger revenue growth which is partially offsetting the slower growth in some countries. India for example is a market where our investments in the brand and the network continue to yield growth. In the quarter India revenue grew 51% and transactions increased 68%. We also remain very pleased with our performance in the Middle East markets.", "The Asia/Pacific region makes up only 7% of our total revenue but includes large remittance markets like China and the Philippines. Asia/Pacific grew revenue 23% and transactions 30%. Revenue growth slowed from the second quarter mostly due to China which reported 6% revenue growth from a 4% increase in transactions. Indications are that China\u2019s results were affected by economic issues that impacted small enterprises that typically send money to China.", "Similar to the EMEASA region strong growth in other Asia/Pacific countries helped somewhat offset slower growth in China. For example we have grown our inbound business to the Philippines faster than the 17% market growth as reported by the Central Bank of the Philippines for the first eight months of the year. The Philippines is an important market. Currently it accounts for more of our revenue than either China or India. ", "We generate revenue in 200 countries with no single country outside the US contributing more than 7%. We serve 15,000 corridors and have the ability to shift investments across the portfolio of markets we serve to maximize growth.", "In addition to expanding our distribution we have other initiatives in place to drive the C2C business. We are focusing on growing our intra business outside the US and Canada where the opportunity is significant. There are 300 million intra-country migrants within countries as compared to the worlds 200 million cross border migrants. ", "Our non-US intra revenue which is mostly within Russia, the Philippines and Chile has grown on an average 30% a year since 2005 and will exceed $100 million this year. We have the network and brand awareness in place to expand and drive growth in this intra business globally.", "We are expanding distribution and attracting new customers to WesternUnion.com and by offering online money transfers through several banks. WesternUnion.com is available in 13 countries now and transactions outside the US grew in excess of 30%. In Asia we launched internet money transfers with our agent CIMB Bank, similar to our offering with Scotiabank in Canada and Deutsche Postbank in Germany, customers in Malaysia can send cash in minutes using their internet banking relationship to any of Western Union\u2019s 365,000 agent locations worldwide.", "We have engaged Publicis Hong Kong to aid in aligning and optimizing our iconic brand worldwide. We will be introducing our new global brand campaign next year. As a reminder the new activities are not incremental spends to the marketing budget. We continue to invest around 6% of revenue on marketing. We recently launched a new campaign in the United States, Cash the perfect gift. The campaign features multiple elements all of which address various holidays and reinforce the trend that cash is the perfect gift.", "Our second priority is to expand our C2B business. Clearly our bill payment business is feeling the impact from the worsening US economic circumstances. Fewer US consumers are able to make bill payments or get new loans so it is as important as ever to execute on our growth plans for C2B including entering other countries and diversifying product offering through joint ventures, acquisitions and PAGO Facil expansion. We have signed billers and have existing agents offering PAGO Facil services in Peru. We plan to launch PAGO Facil in Panama early next year.", "Our third priority is to drive innovation by developing services and technologies. On the Mobile Money Transfer front we announced yesterday our alliance with Orascom Telecom one of the largest mobile operators in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. We plan to work together to introduce mobile remittance services in select markets where Orascom operates including Algeria, Pakistan, Egypt, Tunisia, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe. Orascom has a total of 77 million subscribers.", "In the quarter we expanded our Mobile Money Transfer pilot. Consumers can now visit select Western Union agent locations in the United Arab Emeritus, Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii and send money directly into accounts on Mobile phones of Smart communications and Globe Telecom subscribers in the Philippines.", "We offer money transfer services in most every region where mobile opportunities exist. We are seeing interest in mobile transfers but the speed of rollout is limited by the introduction of mobile wallets by carriers. Mobile wallets are essential to conducting mobile money transfers. Our many capabilities like physical agent locations, brand recognition, technologies and compliance know how are helping us make progress and ensure we are positioned to succeed over the next three to five years as consumer acceptance evolves.", "Our micro lending offering is moving slowly as banks are facing such significant issues and we do not want to take the credit risk on these loans. Another key priority is our focus on improving profitability. For 2008 we remain committed to delivering operating margin excluding restructuring expenses consistent with 2007 at around 27%. We have also set us an objective to deliver up to 50 basis points of margin expansion in 2009.", "We understand that one key to building shareholder value is to grow profitably. We will accomplish this by leverage in our global scale, reducing operating expenses. We completed initiatives this year that are expected to save $35 million annually beginning in 2009, reducing distribution costs by lowering agent commissions and optimizing our global investments. These are unique and unprecedented times. Many economies are stressed making some consumers feel uncertain about employment and their own ability to earn.", "As a result of the economic uncertainty and the negative impact that weakening Euro is likely to have on revenue growth we are taking a more conservative approach and believe it is prudent at this time to withdraw our long term growth objective for revenue and earnings per share. With that said our business has grown well during 2008 and we are pleased with the third quarter results. Our business is strategically and operationally sound and we are well positioned over the long run. ", "We are the global leader in the cross border remittance market. We have all the advantages of scale and the ability to leverage our infrastructure. We have developed a global and in our opinion unmatched distribution network. We continue to invest in our brand that for more 150 years has been one of the most recognized in our industry standing for trust, speed and reliability. ", "We have a diverse revenue stream with more than half of our revenue originating outside the US. We have a robust compliance program and enjoy strong relationships with regulators around the world. We are in a solid financial position and most importantly we have employees and agents around the world who are committed to growing our business.", "Now I will turn the call over to Scott Scheirman our CFO who will discuss our third quarter financial performance and 2008 outlook in greater detail.", "Scott Scheirman", "Revenue for the third quarter grew 10% to $1.38 billion excluding $24 million of benefit from the translation of the Euro revenue grew 8%. The related benefit to profit was $3 million. Earnings per share was $0.33 and included $3 million or about half a penny of restructuring expenses. EPS also included net other expenses that were $11 million higher than expected and $19 million higher than third quarter 2007. The higher net other expenses were primarily driven from lots upon foreign currency contracts related to our hedging program. This had a $0.01 impact to EPS.", "Historically we have been able to predict within a narrow range the portion of the gain or loss that must be recognized in current period income. However, due to the significant market volatility in late September the foreign currency loss this quarter was four times greater than we had anticipated. The financial impact of the portion of each foreign currency forward contract that will eventually be recognized into income is known as the time we enter into the contract. ", "The recent volatility will not change the ultimate gain or loss however, during the contract period we make adjustments to reflect values at quarter end. For the full year we now expect net other expenses to total $120 million up from our previous estimate of $110 million. ", "Transaction fee revenue which makes up 80% of company revenue grew 8%. This was driven by ongoing healthy transaction growth rates and fewer pricing decreases. Foreign exchange revenue is 17% of company revenue and is generated from the difference between the exchange rate we make available to our customers and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire foreign currencies. This revenue stream is driven by our international C2C business.", "The 17% growth in foreign exchange revenue this quarter slowed from last quarter as a result of the average C2C principle being sent by our customers growing slower than in previous quarters. As a percent of principle remitted foreign exchange revenue is relatively unchanged from previous quarters. A strengthening dollar does not impede our ability to grow this component of revenue.", "Third quarter operating margin was 27.2% as reported and excluding the restructuring expenses it was 27.5%. This is a sequential improvement from 26.7% in second quarter and 26.3% in the first quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2008 operating margin excluding restructuring expenses to be consistent with 2007 at around 27% with the fourth quarter being the highest of the year.", "Consistent with the previous quarters restructuring expenses were not included in the operating segments. Of the $3 million in third quarter restructuring expenses $1 million was included in cost of services and $2 million was included in SG&A. For full year 2008 we expect to have a total of approximately $70 million in restructuring expenses a reduction from our original estimate of $80 million. We have not changed our estimate for related expense savings of $10 million this year and $35 million annually in 2009 and beyond. ", "For more meaningful comparisons the following discussion on cost of services and SG&A exclude the stock compensation expense from last years results and restructuring expenses from this years results. As a reminder in the third quarter 2007 the stock compensation charge of $22 million was allocated to cost of services and SG&A. Cost of services included $8 million while SG&A included $14 million. Cost of services grew 10% and was 57% of revenue. The 57% of revenue is consistent with third quarter 2007 and is lower than the 58% of revenue reported in the first and second quarters of this year.", "SG&A in the quarter grew 13% and was 16% of revenue. SG&A was up as a result of higher employee compensation including headcount additions in several international markets as well as planned increases in marketing spend over the third quarter last year. The tax rate this quarter was 27.7% compared to 29.5% in the third quarter of 2007.", "We continue to expect full year tax rate of 26.5% as calculated on our reported full year GAAP pre-tax profit. Remember that when you exclude the restructuring expenses the effective non-GAAP tax rate for this year is expected to be 27.5%. Our tax rate continues to benefit from increased foreign derived profits which are taxed at lower rates compared to US derived profit as well as the finalization and implementation of foreign tax planning strategies that will drive sustainable cash benefits this year and on a go forward basis.", "We convert a high percentage of our net income into operating cash. Through nine months of the year we have generated $925 million of cash flow from operations and are on track to achieve our target of $1.2 billion this year. In 2008 we will return over 100% of our net income to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. ", "Capital expenditures were $45 million this quarter and totaled $125 million through nine months. We now anticipate total capital expenditures to be less than $175 million this year down from our original projection of $200 million. We implemented a working capital strategy that allowed us to better utilize cash generated from US and international operations. We use this strategy to repurchase shares in the quarter without increasing borrowings. In fact, we paid down $300 million of debt during the quarter.", "In the quarter we bought back 20 million shares for $523 million at an average price of $26.13. Since going public we have repurchased about 86 million shares of our stock or 11% of the original shares outstanding at time of spin for $2 billion at an average price of $22.69. At quarter end we had about $1 billion remaining under our current authorization for stock buyback through 2009.", "I want to make a few comments regarding the significant turmoil and financial markets. First, we have historically adhered to prudent financial policies and more specifically we seek to diversify our financial position and to spread out our counter party risk. With that said we, like many others, did have an issue arise this quarter stemming from our investment with the Reserve International Liquidity Fund which was a Triple A rated money market fund. During the quarter we had $300 million of surplus international cash which is not used for daily operations invested with the Reserve International Liquidity Fund.", "Immediately upon hearing the news of Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and knowing that the fund had exposure to Lehman we requested a full redemption. We were told in writing by the Fund that the redemption would be honored at $1.00 net asset value per share but we have not yet been paid. We are working to resolve this matter and we believe that we\u2019ll be a satisfactory resolve. As a result of the actions taken by the Reserve Fund we have reclassified the amount from cash to receivables on our balance sheet.", "Even with this reclassification our cash position at quarter end was strong at $1.1 billion in addition to our strong cash position we have in place a Commercial Paper program that is fully backed by $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2012. Against this credit facility we have less than $100 million of Commercial Paper outstanding on September 30th. ", "Our strong balance sheet, ability to generate high levels of cash flow and prudent financial policies have us in a solid position of being able to meet our financial obligations, invest in our growth, make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders through stock buyback.", "Our C2C segment which is 85% of total revenue posted 12% revenue growth while transactions grew 13%. Reported C2C revenue growth slowed 220 basis points from last quarter. When adjusting for the Euro C2C revenue growth slowed 70 basis points from last quarter. Revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in principle per transaction and to a lesser extent slowing transaction growth in certain markets.", "C2C operating margin was 27.8%, was strong and consistent with last years third quarter excluding the 2007 stock compensation charge. Our international transactions that originate outside of the US total 57% of Western Union\u2019s revenue and grew 28% driving revenue growth of 21%.", "The Consumer-to-Business segment which represents 13% of our total revenue had revenue decline 2% on transaction growth of 2%. Excluding last years stock compensation expense operating income was down 15% and this quarters operating margin of 26.4% is down 420 basis points compared to the third quarter 2007. ", "Simply put, we are handling a lot fewer bill payments than we had originally anticipated at the beginning of 2008 as many more American consumers who would use our service are having difficulty paying their bills and are unable to obtain credit in any form. This is causing the year over year revenue, margin and operating income to decline in C2B.", "Before concluding I\u2019m going to provide color on our foreign currency hedging strategy and how our reported revenue growth for the fourth quarter and 2009 will be affected by the strengthening dollar. Our long term foreign currency hedging goal is to increase the predictability of forecasted profits and cash flows denominated in major currencies other than the US dollar. To accomplish this we estimate net revenue and cash flows from specific foreign countries and then utilize foreign currency forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for the next 12 to 36 months. ", "The Euro translation at the exchange rates we\u2019ve experienced so far this year has added $95 million to revenue in the first nine months. At current exchange rates as the dollar has strengthened we\u2019re expecting no revenue benefit in the fourth quarter or for 2009. In fact, at current exchange rates the translation of the Euro will be a drag on revenue growth in the fourth quarter and in 2009. We will continue to provide both revenue growth on a reported basis and revenue growth excluding the translation of the Euro so you can make a more meaningful comparison of the growth trends.", "On the profit side for the fourth quarter and next year in keeping with our hedging strategy we have foreign currency forward contracts in place that will help improve the predictability of our profits and cash flows denominated in major foreign currencies. In other words, our profits and cash flows will be impacted less by fluctuation in foreign currencies compared to the impact on revenue.", "In the third quarter we saw slower growth in C2C principal per transaction in previous quarters, a moderation in transaction growth rates in certain countries and we expect no Euro benefit to fourth quarter revenue growth. As a result of these factors we have tightened our previous guidance for 2008 revenue growth and earnings per share. We expect revenue growth of 9% to 10% and we are pleased given the economic circumstances that our current outlook is within our original January guidance.", "We expect earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.31 excluding $0.06 per share in restructuring expenses. The corresponding GAAP earnings per share rate is now $1.23 to $1.25. We expect the current environment will not have a sizeable impact on our ability to generate significant cash flow so we\u2019re on track with our original cash flow from operations guidance of $1.2 billion. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to be less than $175 million an improvement from the original plan of less than $200 million. ", "Factoring what Christina said earlier we believe our business model and strategy are sound. Our business continues to growth profitably. Our results this quarter are due to the execution of our four strategies and our geographically diversified portfolio. Our business is solid and we continue to invest to grow our global share of the remittance market. ", "Thank you, now Christina and I will open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "Wondering about the disparity between transaction and revenue growth in international and EMEASA and because that had been closing in prior quarters that obviously was a big reason for more positive sentiment on the stock. What happened in the September quarter and how do you expect that to trend going forward?", "Christina Gold", "As we look at the international there are two elements really that are working here. One clearly is the impact of the Euro which is about half of it in terms of where the Euro has landed at this point in time. The other part is we talked to was we saw revenue in terms of the principle per transaction being less which generates a certain amount of revenue from our F/X rates. Those two elements really caused that spread. I think as we move forward looking at the positioning of the Euro and the US dollar that will continue over a period of time.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "That should continue into \u201909 I guess as well?", "Christina Gold", "In \u201909 we\u2019ll give you guidance in January. I think the Euro, we definitely know the Euro is going to be a drag on us in \u201909 the way its sitting right now.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "What did you see in October versus the August, September trends that made you get more, let me ask a question, what did you see in October and how did it compare to September and August?", "Christina Gold", "October is going forward and so it\u2019s really what we saw going into the third quarter. It\u2019s really as we came through the third quarter we saw that the drop in terms of the amount of principle being set in certain markets and we also saw the big change in the Euro and the strengthening of the US dollar.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 UBS", "One of the highlights of this story has always been the strength and durability of the model you guys have laid out your plan very, very well and comprehensively in all your recent calls. You just withdrew the long term guidance that you gave four months ago due to some near term volatility. I\u2019m not sure how to interpret or reconcile all those things because there seems to be a few conflicting messages there. Why the long term guidance?", "Christina Gold", "We feel really good about our business model and where we are. I think as we look to the long term I think this over \u201909 and going forward that will be a question that people will continue to ask. What our concern was, with the volatility of the marketplace right now and also the US dollar and the Euro what\u2019s going on we felt it prudent to take it off at this time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just looking at the Euro we\u2019re not surprised to see revenue growth lag going forward. I want to make sure I understand the impact to the bottom line. Shouldn\u2019t the hedges prevent any losses or due to the contracts and the way they were done there is still a possibility of losses going forward on the bottom line?", "Scott Scheirman", "It might be helpful to recap what we\u2019ve seen in \u201908 and then talk a little bit about 2009. On a year to date basis the Euro has benefited revenue by about $95 million but on the bottom line the benefit has been about $12 million so significantly less. As the dollar strengthens and the Euro weakens it will have a much more dramatic impact on the top line but because of our hedging program and how we\u2019ve layered out hedges over the next 12 to 36 months the impact to the bottom line will not be nearly as significant.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is there a possibility to still see losses going forward or will it net it out to zero?", "Scott Scheirman", "We\u2019ll give guidance in January of \u201909. The one metric you can think about that for every call it .10 if the Euro moves from say 1.45 to 1.35 it would be about $60 million of revenue impact in 2009. The profit impact would be substantially less on that because of the hedging program.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I wanted to clarify the weakening principle amounts did that weaken throughout the quarter and I guess it got deteriorated in September or was it soft all quarter long?", "Christina Gold", "It\u2019s been something that we\u2019ve been monitoring but its pretty well been across the quarter and it\u2019s across the globe. It\u2019s still continuing to grow so that\u2019s an important point that we are growing principle. It\u2019s not growing at a high volume but it was growing and it\u2019s growing a little bit less now so that has an impact in terms of our revenue. Also I think if you look at principle China which had a high level of principle we saw that deterioration in the growth in China so that has an impact as well.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The outlook in C2B going forward?", "Christina Gold", "On C2B obviously we know that we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us in that category. Clearly we\u2019re working aggressively on PAGO Facil. The US marketplace is an issue for us and we know that. We\u2019re aggressively pursuing expansion and also looking at acquisitions so it\u2019s something that\u2019s really on our radar screen and we would anticipate improvements in that category as we go into 2009.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The improvements would come from, for me I would guess that would be fewer bill payments would continue as the consumer continues to drop off.", "Christina Gold", "I think it\u2019s really looking at acquisitions and looking at global expansion, those are the keys really for us. With the marketplace in the US is what it is and we\u2018ll have to manage it as best we can but it\u2019s really driving on the growth strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Can you guys just talk about anywhere in the business where you\u2019re actually changing the strategy in light of the economic conditions so relative to maybe four months ago now you\u2019re looking at possibly spending less on marketing or less investing and some of the new initiatives, any of that going on in light of the economic environment?", "Christina Gold", "I\u2019ll just talk a little bit and then I can ask Scott to add some flavor in terms of profitability. I think that one of the things that we are ensuring is that we focus and invest in our key strategies for growth because we don\u2019t want to pull back there because we think that our model is sound, our strategies are good. We continue to look at investing in our brand. ", "Also in some of the markets we have added people because we need to round out the teams in different parts of the world. We\u2019re investing in our mobile because we feel that\u2019s really part of our future. Those investments will continue. We always look at ways that we can look at our total business model, where can we reduce expenses and become more profitable.", "Scott Scheirman", "To echo what Christina said we\u2019ll continue to invest where the growth opportunities exist so target our pricing, marketing and our resources to where the best growth opportunities exist around the globe. There are markets like the Middle East that are growing very strong. We\u2019ll continue to invest there. In addition on the profitability side one of our key strategies has been to drive profitability to increase our margins and to recap that it\u2019s really optimizing our investments, its leveraging our scale and we\u2019ve seen this where the international margins continue to move up. ", "We are taking actions to continue to reduce our cost structure; we\u2019ll save $35 million from our restructuring activities. The final thing I\u2019d add like probably many companies now we\u2019ll just be prudent with our expense spending as we move into 2009. We want to continue to invest where the growth opportunities exist.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "On the competitive landscape are you seeing anything unusual out of your traditional competitors in the money transfer channel and then what about some emerging competition are you seeing any impact from card based or mobile from outside the traditional channel?", "Christina Gold", "I think the competitive landscape continues to be very competitive but I would say its stable in the sense there\u2019s nothing unusual out there. We continue to see different players looking at opportunities to go into the mobile space but I think with our recent announcement for Orascom that will be terrific for us. I think that we\u2019re monitoring all competitors we\u2019re looking at the card based competitors as well, not seeing a lot of traction in that area. They\u2019re there, they\u2019re competitive, they\u2019re smart but I think we have the team and the brand and the strategies to compete effectively.", "Greg Smith \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Is there a way to quantify what you anticipate the Euro drag in 2009 if everything holds where it is now should we assume a two to three point drag something like that?", "Scott Scheirman", "Probably the best color I could give you right now is probably like many people I can\u2019t predict what the Euro rates will be six or nine months from now. As I was talking earlier if we look at the metric if the Euro moves about .10 let me just say from 1.45 to 1.35 each .10 is about $60 million of revenue impact to our business. I would probably use that metric and then make your best guess of what you think the Euro is going to do in 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Kissane \u2013 Banc of America.", "James Kissane \u2013 Banc of America", "Following up on Adam\u2019s question in terms of the rationale for backing off the long term growth objectives, I think most people appreciate what\u2019s going on in the current macro environment but say looking beyond 2009, 2010 why can\u2019t you sustain 10% plus revenue growth and mid teens earnings growth?", "Christina Gold", "It\u2019s not a question that we can\u2019t or we won\u2019t I think it\u2019s a question of it\u2019s always a question that\u2019s asked and it seems almost a bit redundant now. When we look at the marketplace that we\u2019re in, we look at where the Euro is we really want to focus in terms of what we can deliver. Plus as we look at acquisitions what that can bring to the table I think we can look at a growth as well. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re saying more or less we\u2019re just saying it\u2019s not a question that we can answer at this point in time.", "James Kissane \u2013 Banc of America", "Are there any fundamental changes in the business going back to Greg\u2019s question in terms of competition, anything emerging there?", "Christina Gold", "Really not, I think we feel very confident in our business model as you saw with the international the 28% transaction growth it really shows the power of our brand and also of our network. As you look at this difficult economy cash is an important component of what people are hanging on to. Our customers are people that need to send money, this is not a discretionary spend it\u2019s an important thing for families. Clearly we will continue to see the growth and we have confidence in our business model.", "James Kissane \u2013 Banc of America", "A little more color on China, it slowed dramatically in the quarter. I think you sighted a small enterprises. It doesn\u2019t seem to reflect weakness in domestic China it\u2019s more the Chinese migrant workers outside of China.", "Christina Gold", "No, I think one of the things that we have in our China business model, we do have a certain percentage of our business is small entrepreneurs that go to China, buy merchandise and use Western Union as the mechanism to pay for it. We\u2019ve known about that for some time and we track that. What happened is we came through that third quarter during the time of the Olympics it was more difficult for people to get visas to go into China. ", "It seems as though that whole business model in terms of the small entrepreneurs going into China, buying merchandise, that slowed part of it being also the strength of the RMB it just seems that there are issues in China. This is not a remittance sender this is a small entrepreneur.", "James Kissane \u2013 Banc of America", "Any sense in terms of what portion of your business is related to construction workers, migrant construction workers around the globe?", "Christina Gold", "No, it\u2019s hard to say because it varies by country because I think if you look at the Middle East and the tremendous growth there, there are an awful lot of people working there on the construction sights but then you also have a very high percentage of people that are working in hotels and in the various industries that are service industries. It varies very much by corridor, by country but I would say there is a percentage worldwide whether its 20% or so it could be at that level. There truly is very specific to corridors.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "You bought back more stock than what we expected; the credit markets have become substantially more difficult although they seem to be getting a little bit better over the last week and a half or so. Are you expecting to continue to buy back stock in this environment and what payments do you have, what debt payments do you have to roll over, over the next 12 months and what is your confidence in being able to do that at reasonable levels.", "Scott Scheirman", "Let me give you a macro view and I\u2019ll try and address your specific questions. It\u2019s probably helpful first to start with what are our cash priorities, how do we use our cash. We\u2019ve had three priorities and those priorities are consistent today. First is to invest and grow the business, number two is to acquire companies and then number three is to return cash to shareholders.", "As we look through each of those priorities we want to make sure and take care of those in the order that we talked about. In the next 30 days we do have about $500 million of floating rate notes that expire. There are really two ways that we will finance those, one would be I\u2019ve got cash on the balance sheet I could pay those off or if the debt markets are, if the window is open and the rates are somewhat reasonable we can go in and do a refinancing on those.", "As far as liquidity, I feel like we do have good liquidity in that we\u2019ve got over $1 billion cash on the balance sheet. We\u2019ll generate $1.2 billion of cash flow and then I\u2019ve also got an open revolver that expires in 2012. It\u2019s $1.5 billion, I do issue CP against that but at quarter end I had $80 or $82 million of CP outstanding against that line.", "With all that being said, we will focus on our cash priorities and we still have $1 billion authorized on our stock buy back that we would like to use as we move through 2009.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Even this quarter now as we speak or going forward the balance of the year you intend to continue to repurchase shares?", "Scott Scheirman", "I want to be cautious given that we have some debt that\u2019s expiring. The markets are choppy right now. When I look over the next 12 to 15 months we\u2019ve got strong cash flow, $1.2 billion and so I would like to go back in the market and buy back stock I\u2019m just not going to tell you the exact timing I\u2019m going to do that. That is one of our objectives.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "The $1.2 billion of cash, how much of that do you need for operations and how much of that is free cash?", "Scott Scheirman", "I\u2019ll use it in terms of capital expenditures that our capital expenditure estimate is less than $175 million so call it $1.2 billion knock off a couple hundred million for CapEx and you\u2019re talking about $1 billion.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "The Banco de Mexico was really dire in the month of August or the data for the month of September and your numbers are not nearly as bad. Is there something wrong with the Banco de Mexico data do you think or what\u2019s going on there?", "Christina Gold", "I think our strategy has really worked well for us. I think that we\u2019ve been very focused. One of the things also we now really looked at our US markets into Mexico as holistically. One of the things we did do in third quarter we invested a little more in marketing, we tried to smooth it out over the year rather than have everything up front a little more in third and little more in fourth and so we were on air quite a bit as well in the quarter. I think all of that benefited our business and we saw certainly we were gaining market share at that period of time.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "If you look at the remittance industry globally if you go back over the last 30 or 40 years and its grown every year but two and those were not even recession years. Do you think we\u2019re going to have, as part of your pulling your long term growth guidance you\u2019re not as confident in the long term growth of the industry. Do you see the industry turning down, remittances declining globally over the next year?", "Christina Gold", "I really don\u2019t. I think we may see a little bit of the principle come down and we did see that a little the last two years. The principle on a macro basis is growing at about 10% and now it\u2019s at about 8% but we\u2019ve been growing almost three times faster than that in terms of principle so I feel very confident in that. It\u2019s really a question of when we look at that long term guidance it\u2019s a question of how realistic is it to keep sayings its there when every year we give you the guidance exactly in terms of what we can accomplish.", "Recognizing as we not only grow the remittance business but look at our bill payment opportunities and look at our, in terms of technology and innovation I think that we have a lot of opportunities to grow that business and grow very strongly.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Last question, I know you\u2019re beating up on this long term growth rate. There are a lot of companies that have long term growth rates. In an unusual environment like this they\u2019re not backing off their long term growth goals, while it\u2019s understood to clearly, you\u2019re going to have a more difficult time given probably fall short of those goals and maybe meaningfully. ", "As we go through this environment but to pull those, the long term growth rate just raises a lot of confusion to what you\u2019re seeing is different then what is obvious in a global economy. Your numbers today and your outlook and what you\u2019re saying is not, I don\u2019t think really different from what one, a rational investor would think but pulling the guidance that you just raised in May is the thing that says well what am I missing.", "Christina Gold", "For us really one of the big issues some is the turmoil in the market and the other issue is where are the currencies and the Euro going in the next period of time.", "Bob Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Right, but that\u2019s a year at a time versus a long term growth rate. Who cares, currency is currency, we can figure out what that is but once you stabilize the currency the Euro isn\u2019t going to go down forever. Do you still believe in the growth rates that you put out assuming a stable currency?", "Christina Gold", "We feel very strongly about our business model. We\u2019re very pleased with the third quarter and we\u2019ve given guidance to the end of the year and we feel confident in our ability to deliver that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "To come back to expectations if you look at the international margin ramp up on both margins and revenue, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes on the international side specifically. Obviously there are some channels that are doing better than others but in aggregate if you think about the international part of the model it seems like that\u2019s going to be the key both near term and longer term. ", "Can you talk about where the biggest variances would really be as we think about six months and then 12 months out on the international revenue side and then also thinking about the margin opportunity that we should yield from the international business?", "Christina Gold", "I think on the revenue side also that we\u2019re starting to see improvements in our US business. I think not dramatic shift but I think over the long term I think also the US has an opportunity to support our revenue as we move forward.", "Scott Scheirman", "What I would add is that macro at our C2C margins this quarter they were 27.8% consistent with Q3 last year once you back out the stock compensation expense from last year. International is clearly a big piece of the C2C business. Our opportunities for margin there is to continue to leverage the global sale and on a macro basis you saw that our cost of services was 57% of our revenue that was down from 58% the first two quarters. ", "Our strategies of leveraging the global scale, reducing some of the agent commissions or signing new agents at lower commission rates are working. Some of the restructuring we\u2019ve done in the US and around the globe is helpful. We have seen in our international business each quarter this year the margins have continued to move up slightly. With the international business 57% of the revenues don\u2019t even touch the US so we continue to believe in the 200 countries around the globe a lot of opportunities to grow on a long term basis.", "Clearly too, a long term driver will be low cost labor and countries that need that low cost labor for their economies to continue. I think a lot of the long term things that have been in play will continue to be in play as we go around the globe.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just as a bit of a look back in history do you guys have on hand any of the historical data on how the model would have held up through any of the last downturns or recessions if you could go back in history and give us a sense for what type of deceleration was sort of implied and the results that you saw in the last one or two recessions that we\u2019ve had in the past recently.", "Christina Gold", "One of the challenges we have as we look at going backwards is that when we go back to let\u2019s say post 9-11 and some of those timeframes we were basically a US centric business. We were not as global as we are today operating in 200 countries. We have a much bigger universe that we work with so we really don\u2019t have models that we can go back to because the company and the existence of what we are today is not what we were going back 10 years ago.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So a lot more international today.", "Christina Gold", "Yes, and being in 200 countries, I think one of the things that we see now, which is one of the strengths that we have is that yes you can have some challenges in certain markets but then other markets are growing very rapidly like we see in the Philippines which we\u2019re growing way past in terms of what the Central bank numbers are. We see very big strength in the Middle East. We have a portfolio that we can balance; we can balance our investments to drive growth.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If you could remind us coming out of the fourth quarter it looks like your revenue run rate should be about $1.37 billion or so relative to the revised guidance here. Can you remind us of seasonality into calendar year 2009 if we\u2019re growing off of that revenue base should we expect to see any down ticks on a sequential basis along the year because of any seasonal impact or is that a number that we can take and annualize and start thinking about the calendar year \u201909 number?", "Scott Scheirman", "I would probably point you to looking at both 2007 and 2008 and our strongest quarter of the year from a revenue standpoint is our fourth quarter. I see no reason right now in 2009 why the fourth quarter would not be our strongest quarter of the year from a revenue standpoint.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Charlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Charlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Looking at the international business transaction growth actually held up very nicely in the third quarter. Is there any way to give us an indication of what it was in September or what type of levels are sustainable over the next few months?", "Christina Gold", "As we gave the guidance we feel confident in our ability to continue to grow the business particularly in international as you\u2019ve seen in the third quarter. That\u2019s really built into our 9% to 10% on the revenue side. The demand is there, what we have seen in a few quarters in a few countries like in Spain where the housing industry has been impacted we\u2019ve seen growth but not at the rate that we were seeing before and we obviously have the issue of less principle but that does not impact the transaction. There is still the need to send cash and send money out.", "Charlie Murphy \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Can you explain in a bit greater detail why the domestic business is getting a bit better and why that is sustainable?", "Christina Gold", "There are two issues here, the marketing investment that we made in the third quarter on the US and having on air time has helped grow that business. The other thing unfortunately when there are hurricanes and other disasters in different parts of the country it creates jobs and work so we see as well with some of the weather related issues it has also driven our business in the domestic money transfer.", "Thank you very much for joining us today and I know that we recognize the challenges of the current economic environment but with that said our geographic balance of our business, our leadership position in the money transfer industry allows us to generate significant revenue, earnings and cash flow which we will invest in our strategic priorities. Our business is strategically and operationally sound and we remain confident in our ability to grow.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call Mr. Gary Kohn, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Gary Kohn", "Welcome to the Western Union fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. As we indicated in our press release we have prepared slides to accompany this call and webcast. These slides are available at www.westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call for your convenience.", "Before turning the call over to Christina, I will take a moment to remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward looking statements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the SEC including the 2007 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. ", "During the call, we will discuss items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. We have reconciled those measures to GAAP measures on our website www.westernunion.com under the Investor Relations section. ", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay, Western Union does not authorize and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay, or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "With that it is my great pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "Welcome to our first quarter call. Looking at the fourth quarter, demand for money transfers softened as consumer confidence, unemployment, and economic headwinds deepened across the world. However, our fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, were $0.37, up 16% year-over-year on revenue of $1.3 billion.", "Full year earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were also up 16% to $1.31. This was in line with our previously guided range and that is something we are very proud of.", "Our operating margin for 2008 rivals our peers in the money transfer space and nearly all peers in the payment space, at 27% excluding restructuring expenses. This margin was consistent with 2007\u2019s operating margin.", "We generated $1.25 billion of cash flow from operations with minimal capex. Cash flow is a key metric for 2009. We believe our overall financial strength has Western Union positioned to continue creating long-term shareholder value.", "Our 2008 results, characterized by 120 basis points of market share gains, were a reflection of our team executing on our four key strategies. In the current environment we are rationalizing expenses and putting an extra filter on investments.", "Despite that, 2009 is a time of opportunity for Western Union, a period where we will prudently invest to create further market share gains. Within the C2C business we handled 49.0 million transactions this quarter compared to 45.0 million in the prior year. Transaction growth moderated from the third quarter and the average amount of money sent per transaction declined. These factors impacted C2C revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Pricing has remained stable. 2008 reductions totaled 1% of consolidated revenue.", "Now let me take you through our three C2C regions: ", "Europe, Middle East, Africa, and South Asia [EMEASA] represent 44% of our total revenue for the quarter and posted a revenue increase of 1% on 16% transactions growth. Full year operating margin in the regions improved to 28%. Europe continues to present a challenge as we experienced a sequential decline in transaction growth from the third quarter into the fourth quarter.", "Offsetting some of the weakness in Europe, the Gulf States and India continue to do well and remain among our fastest growers. In India, revenue growth was 29% with transaction growth of 50%. Across EMEASA we are directing investments to meet market share opportunities, including making intra-transfers available in more geographies and adding new types of agents to the network.", "The upcoming implementation of the Payment Service Directive in late 2009 in the European Union presents an exciting opportunity for us. The regulatory change will make it possible to operate in 27 countries under a single license. This also allows us to expand the classes of trade that can offer money transfer services in certain countries.", "Because this is such a unique opportunity, we believe that it is imperative that we act now and the centerpiece of our effort is the agent acquisition we are finalizing. By acquiring one of our largest agents we will have more direct management control over our brand and the sub-agent network and we are better positioned in several key geographies that will benefit from the Payment Services Directive.", "Additionally, we have established a dedicated sales force that is targeting agents in different classes of trade.

This acquisition positions us to better gain market share and improve margins across key European geographies, especially in light of the upcoming implementation of the Payment Services Directive throughout the European community.", "The benefits are clear. We will have a closer relationship with the network agents and we can run the country or region more profitably by utilizing our scale and operating expertise. This acquisition, including integration expenses, will utilize less than $200.0 million of international cash, impacts 2009 operating margin by about 40 basis points and will be $0.02 dilutive to earnings.", "Beginning in 2009 we will provide revenue and EPS on a reported and constant-currency basis. The Euro is the majority of our foreign currencies but as the international business continues to grow other currencies may become more meaningful to Western Union\u2019s business.", "For comparative purposes, 2008 revenue growth was 6% on both a Euro-adjusted and constant-currency basis.  Fourth quarter revenue growth was 2% constant currency. In 2008 there was an operating income benefit on a constant-currency basis that is offset by derivative losses so netted out there was no EPS impact from foreign currencies in 2008.", "Looking at our outlook for 2009, we expect constant currency revenue to be down 2% to 5% and reported revenue to be down 5% to 8%. Our revenue forecast is based on many drivers, including we anticipate the world\u2019s cross-border remitted principal to grow less in 2009 compared to 2008, we expect single digit growth in our total cross-border principal handled. We expect this growth to be faster than the overall market growth and therefore, again, increase market share.", "We expect mid- to high-single digit growth in C2C transactions with transactions likely to be weakest in the higher-margin U.S. business. We expect principal per transaction to decline. C2C price decreases are expected to be consistent with 2008 at approximately 1% of consolidated revenue.", "And finally, for the C2B segment, we expect the fourth quarter of 2008 revenue and profit trends to continue into 2009. C2B margins will likely decline but not to the same degree as in 2008.", "Our outlook for constant currency EPS is $1.16 to $1.26. Our outlook for reported EPS is $1.18 to $1.28. Our EPS range assumes $0.02 dilution from the Asian acquisition, net other expenses of approximately $150.0 million due to less interest income. This adversely impacts 2009 EPS by $0.03 compared to 2008. A tax rate of approximately 26% and buyback of $400.0 million.", "We provided a wide EPS range to reflect the uncertainty we see across our 15,000 corridors and the factors that will impact profitability. We are trying to hold margins in 2009 but recognize that variables exist, such as revenue performance, product mix, the pending Asian acquisition, and investments that may impede margin stability.", "We expect revenue and EPS to be slightly stronger in the second half of 2009. In addition, we have historically and planned to achieve higher operating margins in the back half of the year.", "During 2008 we improved our cost structure by relocating operations to Costa Rica at outsourcers, eliminating positions, and selectively reducing agent commissions. And had the global economy not changed so significantly, the business model would have delivered margin expansion in 2009.", "About 65% of our costs are variable. These costs should move as revenue moves. In addition, we will closely manage expenses in 2009, including marketing and other expenses. The cost reduction steps we have taken, and our leveragable business model, should allow us to drive margin expansion as the market improves and revenue reaccelerates.", "In addition to our revenue and EPS outlook we expect to generate cash flow from operations in excess of $1.1 billion and to make capital expenditures of less than $150.0 million.", "The $400.0 million buyback target stems from several factors. First, in today\u2019s environment we believe that liquidity is very important and we need to be conservative until the market stabilizes. Second, we believe it is important to maintain our A-minus credit rating. And finally, we believe that the acquisition landscape will be increasingly more favorable in 2009. This is simply a prudent strategy in the current environment. We will monitor this throughout the year and align our cash priorities accordingly.", "Christina Gold", "Before closing, I want to provide some insight into January. In January this year we saw similar patterns to Q4 for C2C transactions. Across our geographies we continued to see softness in places like Europe and the United States while other regions, like the Gulf States, India, and the Philippines remained strong.", "January results are consistent with our expectations relative to our 2009 outlook. We believe we are entering an era where the strong will get stronger. In 2008 Western Union delivered record levels of revenue and cash flow. Revenue was $5.3 billion and we generated $1.25 billion in cash flow from operations. We handled $67.0 billion in cross-border C2C remittances and while we are very proud again to have grown our market share in 2008, we know that with 17% global share, we have opportunity to capture additional market share.", "We remain a leader in the money transfer industry and by the end of 2009 we will have a global agent base that exceeds 400,000 locations. It is our business model, and how it translates into financial performance, that I believe creates such an advantage for us.", "Specifically, we generate significant levels of cash flow and yet the ongoing cash needs of the business are relatively modest. And in terms of expenses, about 65% are variable, allowing us to respond to the economic environment quickly. ", "In terms of our core business, we will invest in our most important assets: our brand, our network, our technology, and our people. We believe that this will allow us to gain market share faster than those that may not have the ability to invest at this time. ", "Specifically on the marketing front, we plan to spend roughly 5% of revenues on marketing, although we have some flexibility here. Our research shows that this is time to go out with a more efficient global campaign. Our focal point is the recently launched Yes! campaign designed to support consistent global messaging. We believe it will enhance awareness and trust, aiding us over time in entering more markets and new businesses.", "Our network expansion has, and will continue to drive growth. Take India for example, since 2003 we have grown the network in India by 3.5 times to more than 50,000 agent locations, driving revenue growth of more than 6 times. This has been a great success and as I mentioned earlier, we look to replicate the India success in markets like Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Malaysia. Again, the opportunity here is very large. Asia Pacific is only 7% of our revenue and yet it makes up an estimated 19% of the global cross-border principal market. ", "We are increasing our investment in technology and systems in 2009. In fact, we continue to evolve our systems that allow us to move money from virtually anywhere in the world and not only in a compliant manner, but in minutes.", "The rules on money transfer and global payments are becoming more complicated and in some cases more onerous. We are fortunate that we have the financial strength and infrastructure to enable us to respond to these developments.", "Additional technology enhancements are designed to support new products, additional distribution channels and to perform deeper analytics on our customer relationship program.", "On the mobile front, our many capabilities, like physical agent locations, brand recognition, technologies, and compliance, are helping us make progress and ensure we are positioned to succeed over the next three to five years as consumer acceptance evolves.", "We offer money transfer services in almost every region where mobile operators exist and have partnered with top operators and associations including Vodafone, Orascom Telecom, Bardi Artel, Globe Telecom, Smart Communications, and the GSM Association.", "On the C2B side, we are investing in international expansion and broadening our product offerings. We will also be evaluating acquisitions. We are optimistic about the landscape and we believe we can participate in consolidation with the goal of strengthening money transfer, diversifying further into payments, and adding value to the company through technology. And finally, I am confident that we can accomplish all this and still return capital to shareholders in 2009.", "Longer term, we are very, very confident in our future. We have a proven business model with talented and committed employees. We have an unrivaled network which is distinctive in its competitive advantage. We serve a large market which will grow when the economy improves. In fact, the World Bank sees remittances to developing countries growing 6% in 2010. ", "The mobile workforce will continue seeking employment opportunities throughout the world. There are an estimated 200.0 million cross-border migrants, as well as an estimated 300.0 million people who have migrated within a country. This population will not only need to transfer cash home, but they will ultimately need other services at the point of sale. We are very well positioned to service the existing and expanding needs.", "So in closing, I will revisit what I talked about in my opening remarks. Although 2009 will be a challenging year for Western Union and many other companies around the world, it is an opportunity to make smart choices by deploying capital to extend our industry leadership and positions us for continued share gains in the money transfer market and other global opportunities that leverage our network, our brand, and customer relationships.", "With that, we are now ready for our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "What are your underlying assumptions for C2C principal per transaction in 2009? It looks like you are expecting transaction growth to stay within, give or take, four key levels. So curious about the principal per transaction, and also how that relates to World Bank and their outlook for 1% to 6% declines in principals remitted.", "Christina Gold", "The World Bank is looking at zero to minus six and I think in 2008 they had about 6% in principal growth. We had 17%, so we always have a much stronger number than they do because of the volume of transactions that we move through the system. ", "But as we look at principal per transaction in 2009, there are a number of variables at work here. You say in the fourth quarter we had a decline of 4%. The other issues that we have are geographic mix and also [intraverses] international transactions. As you know, an intra-country transaction, like in the Philippines, has a much lower principal and much lower RPT, so the growth that we are pushing there is incremental but it doesn\u2019t give you the same amount of principal RPT. So there is some of that at play in our business model as well.", "I think that we are monitoring that across the spectrum and trying balance the different corridors, where the growth is, where there is some slowing, because obviously in the Middle East and India, where we see strong growth, you tend to see a lower PPT and a lower RPT, so that has an impact. ", "So it\u2019s really balancing all those 15,000 corridors across the globe to really come up with where we got to the 2% to 5% decline on a constant-currency basis.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "It sound like a little bit of a premium still to some of the World Bank outlook but it will depend on mix in the end.", "Christina Gold", "That\u2019s exactly right. And I think there will always be a premium because we intend to gain market share in 2009.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "I am having a hard down in getting down to the midpoint of your EPS guidance with the cost savings, the lower tax. It sounds like flat margins and we\u2019ve got the down revenues. I think the difference is other expenses. I was hoping you could give more clarity on that.", "Scott Scheirman", "The other expenses, we are estimating net of $150.0 million and those will be $0.03 worse compared to 2008. It is primarily related to our cash on hand. The interest rates earnings on cash are just at all-time lows so it\u2019s tough to earn interest there. And our key with our cash balance is its safety is most important and then earnings is second most important, within our business model.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "Are there some derivative losses that are baked in there as well?", "Scott Scheirman", "No, it would be primarily interest income on the cash that will be less in 2009 compared to 2008.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "Then the constant currency EPS and the difference between that and the GAAP EPS, the $0.02 or so, what was the delta there?", "Scott Scheirman", "We have had a very effective strategy over the last two to three years and we layer in hedges over the next 12 to 36 months on a rolling basis. So if I use the Euro as one example, when we hedged out 2009, we really hedged it at 2008 rates. And when we hedged 2008 we hedged it at 2007 rates. So as the dollar devalued against the Euro we continued to gain on the bottom line there. ", "So our best guestimate right now, it should be a couple of pennies helpful to us as we move forward into 2009. Because of our effective hedging strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Analyst for Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs.", "Analyst for Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "On the guidance, how do you view your guidance, are you very comfortable with the lower end of the guidance. Do you need to actually have a couple of new signings to make the lower end of your EPS guidance and revenue?", "Christina Gold", "I think we feel comfortable in the guidance in terms of the light of what we see at this moment in time. It has been a bottom-up formulation in terms of how we built the plan. We have worked the 15,000 corridors. We obviously know the markets where we have some stress, but also where we have great opportunities, so we have tried to balance that.", "So we feel very comfortable with the ranges that we put out there for 2009.", "Analyst for Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "With 65% of your cost structure being variable and with the rebates actually coming down as a percentage of revenue, where do you think you have the most of leverage in your cost structure in 2009 and what is your margin expectation in 2009?", "Scott Scheirman", "Our goal is to hold margins in 2009 if possible. It will be dependent upon revenue performance and other factors in investments and so forth. We do believe our business model has leverage and we expect margins to expand as revenue reaccelerates. So we believe we have a leveragable business model for sure.", "One thing that is helpful with our business model is that roughly 65% of our costs are variable so those will move as revenue moves. We took some nice actions in 2008, relocating our operations to Costa Rica to outsourcers. We did do some reduction in force. So we\u2019ve taken all the right steps to get our cost structure positioned well and long term our goal will be to continue to gain market share. We are very well positioned in the marketplace and as revenue reaccelerates we expect to see margin expansion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta - Ftn Midwest Securities Corp.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Midwest Securities Corp.", "I was hoping to get more insight into your agent acquisition, if you are able to talk about it. Maybe the revenue side of that agent and from a big picture standpoint, was this just a great economic opportunity or does this allow you to do things that the agent maybe didn\u2019t want to or their structure wouldn\u2019t allow?", "Christina Gold", "I can give you a little bit. We should be finalizing all the details before the end of the month. But I think this was actually a very important strategic acquisition for us. With the Payment Service Directive that is coming into Europe that will impact 27 countries, it will change the playing field for money transfer companies. So we saw this an important opportunity to go in and be able to manage a business and expand our network and operate a little differently than we do now with the sub-agent network. So we needed a large scale agent.", "And we have been negotiating this for quite some time. It\u2019s been over a year that this has been in discussion so we are delighted that we are coming to a final close on this. But I think over the years this is going to be a key acquisition that is going to give us incremental revenue and will be a tremendous asset for us.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Midwest Securities Corp.", "From a timing aspect, how have you put that in guidance?", "Christina Gold", "I think it\u2019s built in there as $0.02 dilutive and I think it\u2019s 40 basis points on the margin.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Midwest Securities Corp.", "Is that assuming that it happens today or happens in the middle of the year?", "Scott Scheirman", "We anticipate it to close sometime in the second quarter.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Midwest Securities Corp.", "On the cash, I understand wanting to save cash in this environment, so is it that you would do acquisitions in 2009 but they would just have to be incredibly lucrative or is it that acquisition in 2009 it looks like there would be some really good potential because of what\u2019s happening in the environment, that\u2019s why you would like to save some of this cash?", "Scott Scheirman", "We see good opportunities in 2009 and 2010. As we look at acquisition, strategically it has to fit. Our C2B business is one area where we are keenly focused in on. But strategic fit is very important to us, sticking close to our knitting, if you will.", "And also we want to make sure it has the right cash-on-cash, or the economic return as we look forward.", "So we think 2009 is a year of opportunity. The strong will get stronger and we want to be well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Midwest Securities Corp.", "You talked a lot about this inter-company transfer and I know it\u2019s fairly new, but if this build subsides, what would be the impact on margins? Is this a business that has similar margin characteristics as your core business or does it have better or worse?", "Christina Gold", "This is the intra-businesses? I think when you look at the margins, the margins support the businesses. If we look at EMEASA there\u2019s a lot of intra-business in EMEASA, in Russia and some of the countries there, and you saw how they have come up to a 28% margin in the fourth quarter. We have it in the Philippines and again in Asia, we have come up to 25% margin. So it\u2019s really incremental. It\u2019s just maximizing the network you have. But your fundamentals change because you are starting with a lower principal and a lower RPT but on a profitability basis it is very supportive of our margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Kissane - Banc of America.", "James Kissane - Banc of America", "Is your guidance assuming a slowdown in the Gulf States and India?", "Christina Gold", "When we put the guidance together we tried to look at where the risks were in the plan because we have seen some slowing in India. Although it is very strong, it is not as strong as we saw earlier in 2008. So we built that in.", "The other unknown that we see is that in some of the gift-giving occasions where we normally get a big bump, we have kind of pulled that down a bit because we saw even in the fourth quarter of the Christmas, although okay wasn\u2019t what we had expected. So we have built that in. ", "And we have also built in some flexibility in case one part of our corridors have some challenges. Because it\u2019s very difficult to read right now what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re ready all of the commentary.", "We have run the guidance, also, with some economists to get a feel in terms of how they feel about how the different parts of the world are functioning. So we feel very comfortable with what we put out there, but recognizing it is very challenging times and this is an economy that we\u2019ve never quite seen before.", "James Kissane - Banc of America", "And how quickly can you react on the cost structure, if the revenue comes in at the low end of your range, or even below that?", "Christina Gold", "I think obviously we\u2019ve already got science in place in terms of we have earmarked certain things that we can do. Scott and his team continue to look at other ways that we can leverage our business.", "So, as you saw in the fourth quarter, we were still able to have margin expansion despite the fact our revenues were basically flat. So we can react pretty quickly and we keep our eye on it all time, so we are watching it very closely.", "James Kissane - Banc of America", "What happened in Mexico in October? Can you give us a little more color, especially since it came on the heels of an FX hit in the September quarter.", "Scott Scheirman", "In October, during a couple week period, the peso very rapidly devalued against the dollar, as much as 20%. And what we saw, and this is primarily in our Vego business, was that consumers rushed to the counters to send pesos to Mexico and what we normally do is estimate what we think the customers are going to send, and they sent dramatically more peso than what we had anticipated. And as a result when we went back into the market to buy the pesos we bought them at slightly unfavorable exchange rates.", "A couple of things that will put this in context, it was about $5.0 million. Second is we have improved the process and we are more diligent. And then the third, I would say Mexico, because it\u2019s probably been our oldest international market, per se, it\u2019s unique as far as how we settle. We supply the pesos there. Almost all the other receive countries around the globe, I settle either in U.S. dollars or Euros primarily. So we feel like we have the necessary steps to prevent that but we did want to honor the customers when they sent their transactions, to pay those out in Mexico.", "James Kissane - Banc of America", "And on the super agent. I thought the super agents typically had other activities, but it\u2019s not adding anything to your revenue, post acquisition, so are you just buying a slice of the business?", "Christina Gold", "Basically we are buying the piece in total. And what that really allows us to do is really go out and look at our network, how we operate and really look at driving incremental revenues in different countries, because of this new legislation that is coming up and just giving us a bit of difference in the model.", "James Kissane - Banc of America", "So this is unique? You won\u2019t be out trying to buy the other super agents?", "Christina Gold", "No, I think it\u2019s where we think there was an opportunity and where it was enough size and scale to make a difference.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Looking at the guidance, it\u2019s pretty much what a lot of us expected. I guess the big difference in delta is this principal per transaction. Can you talk about the C2C principal transaction for the first three quarters of the year and what it did in the fourth quarter and do you expect that to get materially worse or change the delta to get more negative going into 2009?", "Christina Gold", "I think as we went through 2008 it was growing. In the mid-single digits. Then it went to a negative in the fourth quarter. So obviously there was a big swing there and it happened particularly as we came into, let\u2019s say the holiday period, we saw that drop-off. ", "As we look to 2009 we anticipate that our consumers will still be under stress so it\u2019s as you look at previous years it\u2019s going to be a bigger swing. So we anticipate that that will be a little more difficult in 2009. That\u2019s why we have a bit of a wider range. But it also will depend on which parts of the world, which corridors, are feeling the most stress.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Did I hear minus 4% for the fourth quarter?", "Christina Gold", "Yes.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "And also I guess mix is playing a part into this?", "Christina Gold", "Yes.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "So is there a percentage of transactions now that are intra-country and is there any other piece of the mix that we need to think about?", "Christina Gold", "I think our intra-businesses, as it sits outside the U.S., is not that large, except in countries like the Philippines or in Russia and also Chile. But we see that we can drive that business to a more meaningful amount but it does drive transactions. A high level of transactions. But it doesn\u2019t give you the same RPT so that it does dilute that a little bit.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "And the revenue per transaction in some of the regions you are expecting to take a hit from are probably larger than the ones that are going to be relatively resilient?", "Scott Scheirman", "It varies region by region but we planned at the 15,000 corridor level but it will vary region by region.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "Is there a location growth number? I know for the year you ended at 375.", "Christina Gold", "We expect at least 400,000 by the end of 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Franco Turrinelli - William Blair & Co.", "Franco Turrinelli - William Blair & Co.", "Back on the Asian front, to pick up on Jim\u2019s question, I wasn\u2019t clear if this will be a pure acquisition in the money transfer business or if you\u2019re going to end up picking up and subsequently needing to shed some other unrelated businesses. ", "Christina Gold", "It will be a pure money transfer acquisition.", "Franco Turrinelli - William Blair & Co.", "If we look at your acquisition strategy, obviously it has been a while since you did anything other than agent acquisitions. As you say, the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker in this environment. Are you interested in going back and looking at other money transfer businesses other than the agents that you are already working with?", "Christina Gold", "I think we are looking at some across the globe but we are always looking. I think that one of the phenomena that we are seeing, particularly in the international business, some of the very small niche players are really having difficulty because of liquidity so that is also offering us an opportunity to move transactions over to us as well.", "Franco Turrinelli - William Blair & Co.", "Do you just kind of stick around and wait for them fail by themselves or do you help put them out of their misery?", "Christina Gold", "I won\u2019t say put them out of their misery but we are kind of negotiating sort of deal, to move transactions, not buying the entity but sort of buying the transactions across.", "Franco Turrinelli - William Blair & Co.", "On the derivative strategy, as you point out, that\u2019s working out pretty well for you right now, this is not something that you plan to make money, right? This is really just a hedging strategy. Is your intention to continue to hedge forward rates or are you kind of backing that off a little, given where the dollar has gone?", "Scott Scheirman", "Our objective is completely for hedging and predictability of cash flow. So we will continue with our 12 to 36 months rolling hedging program but it\u2019s just to get predictability of our cash flows and no element of it is for speculation at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Can you give some color, specifically within Europe? Are there any countries, regions, that you particularly notice that really softened, quarter-to-quarter?", "Christina Gold", "I think where we continue to see as the stress point is Spain. And we have seen that through the back half of 2008 and it continues to be a challenge. Obviously the U.K. had some issues. Some of the markets are still growing but not at the pace they were growing before, so that has its impacts. And you can see a little bit in Russia as well because there is a lot of turmoil in Russia.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.", "So it\u2019s really the economies that you would expect based on the economic trends?", "Christina Gold", "Exactly. As you look at GDP and you look at what is going on in different countries, because it\u2019s really pushing our customer and they are looking for jobs. In the end, it will create opportunity for us because people will have to migrate to different geographies or to different jobs and we will be able to pick that up. But on this time of uncertainty they are holding back a bit.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.", "And you haven\u2019t seen any real weakness in the oil-producing nations? You did mention Russia?", "Christina Gold", "In the Middle East, it still continues to be a jewel for us. It is doing extremely well. We are pleased to see that and we see that going into January. But obviously we are monitoring that on a daily basis, because we read the newspapers. But the Middle East, there are so many different types of labor, people that are in so many different industries, that it offers a great opportunity for us in our business.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.", "The monthly transfer out the quarter, was it pretty consistent, October, November, December, or did it get worse at the end of the quarter?", "Christina Gold", "It was consistent, however we didn\u2019t get the bump-up that we would normally appreciated to have let\u2019s say, for the Christmas season.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "How do you think the market is going to change related to the Payment Services Directive?", "Christina Gold", "From our perspective it gives us an opportunity to open different classes of trade. In some of the countries we operate in you have to be a bank. Now you do not have to be so it gives better hours, you can create different types of locations. But we are cognizant as well, from a competitive point of view, it\u2019s easier to get a license, if you get can one license for 27 countries. ", "So that\u2019s one of the reasons that we want to make sure we do this acquisition now and we are out there building that network to make sure that we capture all the opportunities out there.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "And this acquisition, did I hear $200.0 million?", "Christina Gold", "Under $200.0 million.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "On the share repurchase program, I saw you had $400.0 million. Do you expect to execute on that kind of consistently through the year?", "Scott Scheirman", "It is probably helpful to review our cash priorities: investing in the business, acquiring companies, and returning capital to shareholders. So we have targeted $400.0 million and we will look at such things as the financial markets. Our cash flow is in a variety of things. But right now our objective is to repurchase $400.0 million of stock.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "The transaction growth again, it\u2019s a lot stronger than what we thought. How much of it is intra-country?", "Scott Scheirman", "We provided the range of what we are thinking about is mid- to high-single digits. It will be a combination of both cross-border and intra-country. I think one key thing to keep in mind is that we want to gain market share in the cross-border events market. We have gained market share every year the last three or four years and we believe with our strong brand, we will have 400,000 locations a year from now, our financial strength, we are well positioned to gain market share.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "On the acquisition front are you seeing more opportunities in the pipeline? You are focused, I assume, solely on C2B and money transfer, right at this point?", "Christina Gold", "Right. And we do see targets in sight. But clearly for us the must be strategic and that they give us the long-term return. We do see some things that we are very interested in.", "Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "Can you talk about which geographies you are most expanding in?", "Christina Gold", "Everywhere. But I would say one of the things that we also look at is using our international cash, like the acquisition that we are doing now with the agent will use international cash. But again, if it is strategic and will bring value to shareholders, we will go after it wherever it is.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Timothy Willi - Avondale Partners.", "Timothy Willi - Avondale Partners", "Some of the marketing initiatives you are doing, you talked about some realignments of some regions and you r global campaign as well. Is there anything special or different that you had to reconfigure around some of these big, emerging markets like Asia, India, that we may not see initial benefit but your history in building other markets would show that if you are correct in how you are going to be approaching these new markets with what you have learned, that 12, 18 months down the road there should be a real noticeable improvement out of what you are trying to do with the brand and the agent network versus how they have been performing?", "Christina Gold", "I would take it in two tranches. If I take the Americas and Stewart\u2019s team, I think they have really organized this one front to the consumer and looked at the segmentation of the consumer but really making a more effective fact to the consumer. So like with the Yes! campaign, incorporating that. Going against the right targets. So I feel very strongly that we will see benefits of that as the U.S. market improves, I think we are really going to see gains there.", "As I look at the region that we created between EMEASA and Asia, India has been a strong performer for us and that\u2019s been within Hikmet\u2019s group. I think when you look at Indonesia and Malaysia and having the leaders from India have now connected to those markets, I see tremendous opportunities to take that 7% of our business and double it. So there are huge opportunities there. And I think that team, with their skill sets, and we have done some reorg underneath Hikmet, I think that is really going to drive and we are going to see great numbers from them as we move forward.", "Timothy Willi - Avondale Partners", "How much of that Asia area would you say, meeting the metrics and the returns and the goals you have set for that marketing program, how much of that would be dependent upon the macro environment? You\u2019ve said in the U.S. that market has to turn but are there levers you can pull with Asia just on the marketing side that you could see a benefit without the macro having to come back to a great degree?", "Christina Gold", "I think in Asia we have more opportunity in certain markets. Obviously China is a very different kettle of fish. But if you look at some of the other markets, I think one big one is just network expansion. Hikmet\u2019s team has really driven growth in the network. We talked about India, they grew to 50,000 locations. Four or five years ago we had 3,000 locations, now we have 50,000 and their revenues have grown six times. So you can see the importance of having the network right and having the connections right. So that kind of thinking is going to go into countries like Indonesia, where there is a huge population and we really have such a small share of that market.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from David Scharf - JMP Securities.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities", "I want to revisit the acquisition and the Payment Services Directive. As I understand the PSD it basically makes it easier for other entities to enter the money transfer business. It tries to increase competition, level the playing field. I\u2019m trying to understand the context of this acquisition, it sort of positioned in your comments as strategic and a big boom. It sounds like you are spending close to $200.0 million defensively, because you have to, because of this directive. Are similar initiatives potentially afoot in other parts of the globe, not just within the European Union and if this is going to be a trend?", "Christina Gold", "I think it is a great opportunity for us. Obviously there is a competitive element to it. But the real issue here is that certain classes of trade were closed to money transfer companies. We know how to really put feet on the street and drive those classes of trade into our network. By making this acquisition, picking up a sales force, connecting with our sales force, building that team, we will move through Europe to make sure that we pick up that network and we don\u2019t leave it to others. And as we do that we will gain more market share and more points of presence for our business.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities", "Do you have any sense of what the landscape in Europe is going to look like over the next 24 months with this initiative in place in terms of other non-traditional remittance companies perhaps entering the market, that they may be fairly well capitalized or do you feel at the end of the day it\u2019s really not going to invite that many new entrants?", "Christina Gold", "Well, you have to think about the brand, which we have, which is outstanding. Plus you need a network because even if you open up a location you have to send it somewhere, so we have that. You also have to have compliance. You have to have the capabilities and all of this takes money. And we have cash.", "So I think those are all the important ingredients to make it happen.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities", "Just revisiting the underlying assumptions behind the revenue guidance, I realize this is a bottom-up 15,000 corridor plan. I\u2019m wondering what type of unemployment assumptions are really underlying the low end of the guidance, the 8% revenue fall off? The immigrants are in place. People crossing borders, that trend hasn\u2019t stopped. But the bottom line is they need jobs and obviously employment tends to be a lagging recoverer. Everything spreads from the U.S. globally. Is the low end of your revenue guidance assuming a certain unemployment rate in the U.S. and ultimately how that may filter out to the rest of the globe?", "Christina Gold", "We have taken that into consideration. Clearly we recognize the U.S. is one of our more challenged markets. But we have also looked at other markets across the globe individually so it\u2019s a combination of all of that. And I feel very comfortably that we have dug deep into this to get a good feeling of what we have. We recognize, too, that our customers, regardless of unemployment, which is a big issue, will still look for ways to earn money but just have a little less to send. So I think that this is not something that is going to last forever. We will come through this phase and the stress of our business will allow us to continue to see enormous growth as we come out of this and also the work we have done on our value chain will really help us to leverage our margins going forward.", "So we feel very confident in what we put into our guidance and where we are taking the business.", "David Scharf - JMP Securities", "Should unemployment in the U.S. by the middle of 2009 actually reach double digits and then the implications for what that means for Western European economies which have so many immigrant workers, would the low end of your revenue guidance capture that?", "Christina Gold", "I think that\u2019s what we tried to do in having a much wider range, is to give us a feel of what are the book ends of this. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. There could be something extraordinary that happens in six months. But as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we have out there and we feel very confident in our business model.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue.", "Gary Kohn", "Thank you all for joining us today.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Morgan", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Operator", "Welcome to the first quarter 2009 Western Union company earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Gary Kohn, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Gary Kohn", "Good morning everyone. Welcome to Western Union first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. As we indicated in our press release, we have prepared slides to accompany this call and webcast. These slides are available at westernunion.com under the investor relations tab and will remain available after the call.", "Before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to remind you that today's call is being recorded and that our comments include forward-looking statements. I ask that you refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the 2008 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call we will discuss items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principals. We have reconciled those measures to GAAP measures on our web site, westernunion.com under the investor relations section.", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of the Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "With that, it's my great pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "Welcome to our first quarter call. We entered 2009 with a strong focus on gaining market share, driving profitability and generating cash flow, and we were pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Our revenue was in line with our expectations at $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 5% or flat constant currency adjusted compared to a year ago.", "We earned $0.32 per share, up 10% from last year excluding the 2008 restructuring expense, and underlying these numbers was the fact that we handled $15 billion in cross border remittances during the quarter an increase of 4% over the last years first quarter when adjusted for currency.", "During 2008 and 2009, we made great progress of cost saving initiatives including reductions in head count, the relocation of numerous positions to lower cost geographies, selectively lowering agent commissions and the consolidation of our C to C regions. ", "These efforts, as well as the timing of marketing expenditures and other investment let to a first quarter operation margin that rivaled our largest peers in the payment industry at 28%. This was a 210 basis point improvement from a year ago excluding the 2008 restructuring expense.", "We generated $357 million of cash flow from operations for the quarter with CapEx of just $16 million. Cash flow and liquidity continue to be a focus in 2009. We are in a strong financial position and believe this will be a key contributor to creating long term value for shareholders.", "Within the C to C business, we experienced transaction growth of 7% year over year. In fact, we handled 46 million transactions this quarter compared to 43 million in the prior year. As expected, transaction growth moderated from the fourth quarter and the average amount of money sent per transaction declined. These factors impacted C to C revenue growth for the period.", "We maintain our stance that 2009 is a year of opportunity for the company and that mind set is exemplified by our acquisition of FEXCO Money Transfer business in Europe, along with our new agreements with U.S. Bank and Fidelity National Information Service. In our view, these key actions provide tangible evidence that we are able to leverage our strength and either acquire or partner to drive incremental market share opportunities through new channels around the world.", "Now let me take you through our three C to C regions. Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia represented 43% of our total revenue for the quarter and experienced a revenue decrease of 4% on 15% transaction growth. However, on constant currency basis, revenue was up.", "As expected in Europe, we experienced a modest slow down in transaction growth from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We were pleased to see certain countries hold relatively stable to fourth quarter growth rates, but clearly there are others that remained under pressure including Spain and Russia.", "Offsetting mixed results in Europe were the Gulf States and India, two areas that remain among our fastest growers. The Gulf States performance was strong, slowing only slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008. India's performance contributed to the regions results with revenue growth of 19% and transaction growth of 42% in the quarter.", "Across the Middle East we are directing investments at market share opportunities. In Europe, we are particularly focused on opportunities presented by the November 2009 implementation of the payment services directive. This regulatory change will allow us in many countries, to expand the classes of trade that can offer money transfer services. This is an exciting development and for that reason, we have established a dedicated sales force to sign new agents.", "Additionally, we took an important strategic step by acquiring our agent FEXCO Transfer business which allows us to operate across Europe more profitably with broader growth opportunities.", "In the first quarter, the Americas regions represented one third of consolidated revenue and experienced a revenue decline of 7% year over year on a transaction decline of 3%. In the region, our domestic business saw 10% revenue and 7% transaction declines for the quarter. Mexico say revenue decline 10% and transactions declined 9%. We believe that these businesses will continue to be challenged throughout 2009.  Transaction growth in our U.S. outbound business was stable compared to the fourth quarter.", "In the America's we implemented a new go to market strategy that has enhances efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically we have combined our U.S. and Latin American organizations including the Western Union V-Go and Luanda sales forces. We are looking to open new distribution points and are making progress in the U.S. banking channels as the U.S. Bank and Fidelity National agreements would suggest.", "Asia Pacific grew revenue 3% on a 25% increase in transactions. Revenue growth slowed in part due to headwinds in China where revenue decreased 13% on a 1% transaction decline. For our China business, sequential revenue and transaction trends continued from the fourth quarter into the first as transactions conducted by small business users usually exceeding $1,000 had been adversely affected by economic conditions.", "Our team has increased their focus on China and is taking steps aimed at maximizing growth and profitability in this important market. Specifically, we have brought together a cross functional team to create a new strategy which includes a deeper sub regional structure and marketing strategy, development of closer affiliations with key inbound corridors and an updated marketing approach with more localized grass root activities.", "The Philippines inbound remittance growth outpaced the growth reported by the Central Bank of the Philippines. We continue to see significant potential in this market as migrant flows remain robust. According to the Philippines Department of Labor and Employment, in January 165,000 Philippinos migrated overseas, a 25% increase year over year. This increase comes on the heel of the record 1.4 million Philippino workers who immigrated during 2007.", "As the Asia Pacific region accounts for just 8% of our revenue, but represents nearly one-fifth of the global remittance market, the region is one of our largest core opportunities. ", "Moving to our consumer to business or payment segment, we generate nearly 90% of the segments revenue in the United States and much of this stems from home mortgage, credit card and auto loan payments. Much like the fourth quarter, we are continuing to feel the impact of the recession. The American consumer is obviously under pressure and those likely to use our services are conducting fewer payment transactions.", "In an effort to diversify, we continue to evaluate acquisitions and are pushing hard on international expansion. We have introduced bill payment in Peru and Panama and are also working on obtaining a license in Brazil. These expansion efforts build on the continued success of our business model.", "On the product front, we recently announced that through our relationship with Yodlee, Fidelity National will offer its customers integrated online expedited bill payments. We look to attract more partners and sign more deals that leverage our ability to offer same day bill payment in the United States. This is an important step to expanding the segments' reach into new customers and channels.", "So to sum up the first quarter, Western Union is performing well in a tough environment and we credit our strong brand and our diversity and scale with operations in 200 countries and 15,000 corridors. We delivered transaction growth, strong margins and generated significant cash flow, the hallmark of our model.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, down 5% on a reported basis and flat constant currency adjusted. In the first quarter we delivered $0.32 earnings per share. Transaction fee revenue for the first quarter which makes up 80% of company revenue declined 6% due to the impact of currency translation and slowing transaction growth with C to C. Year over year, C to C principal per transaction declined 10% in the first quarter or down 3% on a constant currency basis. ", "Foreign exchange revenue is generated from the difference between the exchange rate we make available to our customers and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire foreign currencies, and in the first quarter, foreign exchange revenue was down 2% year over year.", "Taking first quarter revenue down further, reported revenue in C to C segment which was 84% of total revenue, declined 5%. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 1%. Revenue in this segment was driven by transaction growth of 7%.", "An increasing number of corridors have experienced the impact of global economic slowdowns which we expected. Our international C to C business saw revenues decline 3% or on a constant currency basis, up 3%. Transactions grew 11%.", "A portion of the international business, those transactions that originate outside the U.S., saw a revenue decline of 3% or growth of 5% constant currency adjusted while transactions grew 16%. The spread between C to C revenue and transaction growth rates widen in the first quarter compared with fourth quarter 2008. The largest factor in the reported revenue number accounting for half of the 12% point difference was currency.", "Also impacting the spread was first, geographic mix. Transactions carry different revenue per transaction based on originating geography and destination. Second was product mix. Intra transfers have a lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions.  And third was price decreases. The combined impact from geographic mix, product mix and price decreases was consistent with fourth quarter 2008. ", "As we stated on the fourth quarter call, the spread may continue to widen in 2009 from currency translation and our global initiatives to drive our intra country money transfer business.", "First quarter C to C operating margin was 29% compared to 26% in last years first quarter. Contributing to the overall C to C margin improvement were the relocation of call centers, work force reductions, combining of C to C regions and management of expenses.", "The C to C segment which is 14% of our revenue saw revenue decline 8% in the first quarter. Operating income for the segment was down 10% and first quarter operating margin of 29% with 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2008.", "We have taken costs out of the business and will continue to evaluate additional cost savings initiatives. That said, we do not foresee improvement in the U.S. C to C business in 2009. This makes our international expansion and product diversification including acquisitions all the more important.", "Moving down the P&L, let's go to cost of services and SG&A. To get a meaningful comparison to 2008 we excluded the $24 million of restructuring expenses incurred in 2008's first quarter. On an apples to apples basis in the first quarter, cost of services declined 250 basis points to 55.7% of revenue versus 58.2% in the first quarter of 2008. We drove this improvement from the cost center relocations we undertook and selective agent commission reductions we achieved in 2008. ", "In terms of SG&A in the quarter, it was 15.9% of revenue, generally consistent with the first quarter of 2008. Going forward, we expect SG&A to increase as a percent of revenue due to costs related to the FEXCO acquisition and timing of certain investments.", "First quarter consolidated operating margin was 28.4%. This is a 210 basis point improvement from 26.3% excluding restructuring in the first quarter of 2008.", "During the quarter, we benefited from $40 million in annual cost savings we achieved from the steps we took last year. Also helping the margin in the first quarter was the timing of certain investment and lower, more effective marketing expenditures at 4% of revenue. We expect the marketing spend to increase throughout the year to about 5% of 2009 revenue.", "As a reminder, about 65% of our costs are variable so they move with revenue and we are confident that our business model allows us to drive margin expansion as the market improves and the revenue grows.", "The tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% compared to 29.2% in the first quarter a year ago. The decrease is primarily a result of a higher proportion of foreign direct profits which are taxed at lower rates compared to U.S. derived profits and the effective tax efficient strategies implemented in 2008. We expect these items to drive sustainable cash benefits on a go forward basis.", "For the quarter, our already strong liquidity improved. Cash flow from operations was $357 million. Capital expenditures were $16 million. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash on hand with about $900 million in U.S. cash and $600 million internationally.", "In February, we refinanced a $500 million, 364 day bank loan by issuing five year bonds at a 6.5% interest rate. We have debt of approximately $3 billion with maturities of $1 billion in 2011, $500 million in 2014, $1 billion in 2016 and the last $500 million in 2036.", "Additionally, we have a commercial paper program that is fully backed by a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that expires in 2012. At quarter end we had no commercial paper outstanding.", "On March 31, we had about $100 million remaining due to us from the reserve international liquidity fund. We expect to receive the full amount from the fund. Our cash position, cash flow generation and our A-A3 credit ratings allow us to invest in the future to expand our market share.", "To put this into context, our business model will continue to generate significant cash flows. Liquidity is a distinct advantage for Western Union. For 2009 we are reaffirming our outlook as provided during the fourth quarter 2008 earnings release. We expect constant currency revenue to be down 2% to 5%, GAAP revenue to be down 5% to 8%.", "Going into the year we had planned for pricing decreased to total 1% of full year revenue. As our leaders review their new areas of responsibility, they are identifying market place opportunities and shifting investments. As a result, we may see pricing decreases total around 2% of revenue for the full year.", "For EPS, our constant currency range remains $1.16 to $1.26 and GAAP remains $1.18 to $1.28. We are expecting the full year margin to be around 27%.", "In addition to our revenue and EPS outlook, we reiterate the following; we expect to generate cash flow from operations in excess of $1.1 billion and to make capital expenditures of less than $150 million.", "Finally, we repurchased $100 million of Western Union stock during the first quarter and that puts us on track with the $400 million stock buy back target.", "Christina Gold", "We continue to see 2009 as an opportunity, a time when the strongest brands have a true competitive advantage. In Western Union's case, the economic slow down though certainly an issue for us, hasn't slowed our momentum as it relates to organizing our business and investing for tomorrow.", "We made our regional structure more efficient and effective by expanding Hikmet Ersek's responsibility to include Asia Pacific and placing Stewart Stockdale in charge of the consolidated Americas region. Additionally, Vanna Clark joined Western Union to lead the C to B or payment segment as well as oversee our global strategy.", "She brings to Western Union a wealth of strategic and payment knowledge. In her more than 20 years with Wachovia, she gained deep expertise, especially in marketing, innovation, brand development, customer loyalty and strategic planning.", "This sets the stage of strategic progress aimed at moving our core money transfer business forward while pursuing other initiatives that will target the broader payment space. We are as focused as ever on growing our core agent based cash to cash money transfer business. Over 90% of our C to C transactions fall in this category.", "We are building on our success here by investing more heavily in channels that not only move the ball forward in money transfers but allow us to make progress with new incremental consumers. In addition to other initiatives there are three offerings we are focused on; westernunion.com, intra country money transfers and account to cash.", "Each of these channels is less than 2% of total revenue today, and is growing transactions at double digit rates. We believe they provide significant opportunity. ", "We have been working hard on international expansion of our online network, westernunion.com and making the overall user experience easier and faster. Based on the site improvements we are experiencing positive transaction and revenue growth in the United States. We are also seeing 20% plus transaction growth on international westernunion.com sites. And we have improved margins in this important channel.", "We are leveraging our network and high brand awareness to develop even more intra country corridors. Outside the United States, we have $100 million plus intra business with transaction growth exceeding 20%. We are making progress on growing this into a more meaningful business.", "We made great strides in our banking strategy in the United States with the signing of U.S. Bank and Fidelity National. Our strategy is designed to expand our distribution and more importantly, expand our brand to new customers through banks physical as well as online distribution. We have made solid progress in attracting new customers with our online relationships with many banks including Sims in Malaysia, Duetsche Post Bank in Germany, Scotia in Canada and other similar bank relationships that allow for account to cash money transfers in addition to the retail walk in service at these banks.", "In fact, just months into the relationship, Scotia accounts for around 2% of all our business in Canada, serves mostly new customers who send higher principal and is on a pace to double their transactions this year. We are excited to capture more opportunity with our banking strategy and our new relationships.", "In Europe, we are prepared for the upcoming Payment Services Directive implementation. We have a dedicated sales force which is already prospecting potential agents. The FEXCO acquisition also positions us well to offer money transfers through new types of agents and taking on FEXCO's money transfer operations gives us a center from which to operate and grow throughout Europe while becoming more profitable.", "I was recently in Europe to meet with the sales and the integration teams and I am pleased with their progress and confident in our ability to capture the opportunity.", "On the mobile front, we continue to sign key operators globally and expect to make more announcements in the near future. Our mobile team is working hard in implementing new tests and understanding our current pilots which are focused on key intra and cross border opportunities.", "Our Americas team is broadening its test of the Western Union Money Wise prepaid reloadable Visa card including a new innovative feature overnight home delivery. Preliminary results on our test locations have been good and we are planning to begin tests in Kansas City and St. Louis. We are also investing in technology and process improvement initiatives that better position Western Union in the market place. ", "The revised report issued by the World Bank in March forecasts remittances to developing countries to return to modest growth in 2010 as the mobile work force continues to seek employment throughout the globe. The report states that remittance flows remain resilient as many migrants are likely to stay in their country.", "In addition to the migrants who will stay, there still exists a migrant flow to destination countries, albeit at a slower pace than historical levels. Importantly, this population needs to transfer cash home. Based on these long term trends and associated investments, we are making Western Union much more of a consumer centric organization with the emphasis on developing new products based on demand and marketing capabilities to sell them to our global base.", "In an effort to strengthen our understanding of our consumers, we have moved our consumer data base which now spans 200 countries, in house. We have a dedicated team who is leveraging this consumer data to provide stronger analytics supporting many key areas including more effective price modeling, better market demand forecasting so we can add agents to the most impactful locations and increase cost efficiencies through better targeting of marketing investments for customer acquisition and retention including maximizing the benefit of our more than 11 million gold cards. Utilizing this data more effectively will certainly allow us to grow more profitably.", "To ensure that our brand matches up globally with this strategy, we've launched a Western Union YES campaign. This campaign is our first truly global marketing effort and we are leveraging many techniques across 200 countries and territories. ", "We have made great traction using social media including a micro site called the Western Union YES effect, U-tube, and Face book. The YES campaign was launched in New York, London, Paris and Toronto to great reviews by customers and employees. We showcased the new commercials to more than 400 agents during a recent meeting in Capetown. The excitement was overwhelming.", "We will be running our commercials in 21 languages in the coming months to compliment the other grass roots efforts. Western Union's physical presence truly makes it the world's payment network and for that reason, we believe we have a significant market opportunity, and a strategy to get there, and at the core of the plan we are allocating capital and other resources to an increasing set of opportunities that leverage our network, brand and customer relationships.", "We are now ready for our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The operating margins were significantly better than I expected at 28.4%, but you are kind of maintaining a guidance of 27% operating margin. I'm just trying to see if there are additional expenses in there that would cause the margin to fall sequentially because usually first quarter is seasonally the weakest.", "Christina Gold", "I think that we're just delighted to see the margins that we achieved in the first quarter. I think one of the things when we look at our guidance and where we see revenue is going to be for the year, we have to temper that into it as well. So there is investment in marketing, but it will still be around the 5% level, so it's really a timing of some of the investments going after Mother's Day, Christmas, Ramadan, some of the key holidays. So they come at different times in the year.", "Obviously we've very focused on margins, but there is a little bit more on the technology side, but not a large amount so it's really a question of some timing and also just where the revenues land as we go through the year.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I think you said pricing is going to be down 2% versus previously. I didn't quite get the reason why that was.", "Christina Gold", "We are really planned right now at about 1.4%. That's about where we are, but as Hikmet and Stewart have gone into their roles, we see some of the corridors, some opportunities to gain some share. So as we did in the Middle East, we priced not so much from a competitive position but really to gain share, so we see that there's an opportunity there, so that may bump up to about 2% for the year as we go through the year.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The guidance for the year last quarter had single digit principal remittance growth and it looks like remittance growth was down 3% so we got a little less than you expected.", "Scott Scheirman", "It was actually about what we expected. One thing to keep in mind is that on a reported basis, it is minus 3%. On a constant currency basis it is plus 4% and our objective is to continue to gain market share and use our $1.1 billion plus of cash flow to do that.", "Also, I think as you move throughout the year, it's things like now the Euro may move more in parity from where it was a year ago to where it is today. For example, a year ago the Euro was $1.50. It's about $1.30 today in rough numbers. And in the fourth quarter it was about $1.30.", "So as we move throughout the year, I think as you look at the cross border principal, that will begin to normalize. But our objective is to gain market share as we move forward.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Then the other one would be principal per transaction. It looked like it was down 10%. I think it was down 4% last quarter. I know that the guidance was for it to be down. I don't know if that was in line with expectations to minus 10%.", "Scott Scheirman", "It was actually where we expected. On a reported basis, it was down minus 10%. On a constant currency it would be down about minus 3%. So what we're continuing to see is our customers are coming to the store front. They're sending transactions. C to C transactions grew 7%. Cross border principal on a constant currency basis was up in the low single digits at 4%.", "So the strength of our brand, the 379,000 locations are continuing to see customers remit money back to their loved ones, and it's one of those things where it's not a discretionary spend for them. They want to get money back to their loved ones. So we'll continue to work to gain market share as we move through the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta - Ftn Capital Markets.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask a little bit about you intra country opportunities. You've talked about that a lot. Is there any way you could talk about what some of the near term opportunities are and maybe some more of the longer term opportunities and what the potential is for Western Union.", "Christina Gold", "I think if we look right now where we see a strong growth in the intra, we have it in the Philippines. We have it in Chile. We have it obviously in Russia. So those are some very strong markets. So I think we're looking at various parts of Eastern Europe. We're looking at some countries there which are not as big as some of the big long term opportunities like the China's, India's of the world where we see tremendous opportunity.", "I think that's where we feel that mobile could be the entree into us for intra in either China or India. So that's one of the reasons why we're pushing very hard on that because there's about 300 million inter country migrants that we could take advantage of.", "But we're looking to grow that and not only intra but let's say a pan European strategy because with their Payment Services Directive, we can now create a more cohesive pan European one as well as we opened up South Africa a few months, we'll have a pan African strategy as well. ", "So again, these are some of them are more cross border, but they're really almost like intra taking continents and working them through.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Capital Markets", "On of the things you mentioned, one use of cash was acquisitions and I'm wondering, is this acquisitions of existing agents or is this acquisitions of other products or companies that might help you grow? If you had, what would be one over the other?", "Scott Scheirman", "It really could be a combination of both of those. As we look at acquisitions we believe there's a number of opportunities out there. A key for us is to make sure we've got the right strategic fit as we look at the acquisition. And then second is the right cash on cash economic return. But clearly we acquired the Money Transfer business of FEXCO. We made some agent equity investments so we're always evaluating opportunities there.", "And we're also looking at opportunities that may allow us to expand our geographic footprint or extend some of our product expansion in some of our key product areas.", "Kartik Mehta - Ftn Capital Markets", "I wanted to figure out if there's been a change in consumer behavior other than just people sending less money. Have you seen any other changes as in the distribution method they're using? Anything else that you've been surprised by from consumers that are using your service?", "Christina Gold", "I think what we're seeing is our core consumers behavior is very consistent except that they're very stressed so they don't have as much money, but what we are seeing though is we're getting incremental consumers by doing the cash to cash business.", "Just take Scotia bank, it's 2% of Canada's business in less than a year and it's going to double, so we're seeing that we're able to bring customers into the system. Also, as we've improved our capabilities on dot com, again bringing in new customers into the system. So we're actually broadening the franchise to other consumers who use our services.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Just a quick question as it relates to EMEA region and the differential between the revenue growth and the transaction growth, the 19% delta. I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color and sort of breaking down the piece and sort of drill that differential between currency, product mix, pricing, just a little bit more color on the differential.", "Scott Scheirman", "What primarily the difference in EMEA region compared to prior quarters or the fourth quarter is really currency, and if you think about on a consolidated basis, currency impacted us by about 5%. GAAP number was down by constant currency was flat revenue growth. ", "So if you really apply that to EMEA which is a large part of our international business, it even had a much more magnified impact on EMEA. If you exclude the currency impact revenues were clearly up in the EMEA region.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Any way you would be able to be a little bit more specific? How much the currency impact was in EMEA?", "Scott Scheirman", "I would probably do is refer you to slide 17 in the deck which will really give you an overview of the C to C and EMEA is a part of that. And clearly, what we've seen if you compare Q1 to Q4, the difference from product mix, geographic mix, pricing is consistent with Q4.  Really what's driving the difference on an overall basis which would be true in EMEA is currency too.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Similar to Bryan Keene's question on the operating margins, but if I look at it just from a gross margin perspective which clearly was upside relative to what we were expecting, but is there any reason to think that these gross margin levels aren't sustainable going forward? How much of the benefit was currency on the gross margin side?", "Christina Gold", "Let me just give you a little bit of color on that as well. I think the other thing, obviously we planned our investments for 2009. We did though as we came into Q1, we were very careful in our management of expenses waiting to see what was going to happen in the market place, because we're trying to balance 200 countries, a lot of corridors, and making sure that we could deliver in terms of our guidance and also deliver in term of what we were expecting for the business in terms of growth of transactions.", "I think you see that on the agent commission side and that line, we really have made tremendous progress with the reallocation of some of those contracts that we've done with agents and the new signings, but also when you look at moving the call centers out of the country, that really has improved that line.", "So some of that will stay. It's more on the expense line we're going to see, Mother's Day is coming and that's a key event for us, so there will be more spent, because there is still the question as you look at our guidance, we recognize that there's still challenges in the market place as it relates to revenue.", "Scott Scheirman", "Clearly the cost of services line, we're pleased with that. As Christina mentioned many of the expense actions we took in 2008 and some of them in 2009 have helped out with call center relocations, head count reductions and selectively reducing agent commissions and signing new agents at lower commission rates.", "As we move forward, we are targeting a 27% margin to make sure that we have the right balance of profitability, but investing to drive the growth. And on an overall basis, our investments are relatively the same. I'll give you an example.", "Marketing, we're targeting about 5% of revenues on a full year basis. We're a little bit less than that in the first quarter. We'll probably be a little bit higher as we move through the quarter, but that 5% is consistent with where we were in 2008.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "The trends towards the end of the quarter, did you see any change, any stabilization or is it a consistent pattern month to month to month?", "Christina Gold", "I think when we look at, we saw a slight step down from Q1 from fourth quarter and it was really consistent throughout the quarter so there wasn't sort of a ramp down. It just kind of pretty well spread across the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you go into a little bit of detail on some of the new initiatives that you announced over the last couple of days, specifically some of the bank relationships in terms of the pace of adoption and how quickly to expect to see some of those banks begin to contribute to the growth?", "Christina Gold", "Obviously we're very delighted about U.S. Bank and they will actually be going live in the month of May, and we'll be hooking them up so they will become a retail location for Western Union offering our services starting in May. As we move through and develop our relationship with them, we look to see account to cash and other opportunities for us that will develop with them, but that will be a little bit longer term.", "Obviously you saw with Scotia Bank it's been very, very strong and also we have it with the Deutsche Post Bank. We have a number of things that are doing extremely well as it relates to that banking strategy.", "Again, with Fidelity National we have two different relationships there; one is that they will be offering money transfer services to their 8,500 members so the smaller banks, for us to reach out to 8,500 banks is more complicated, but we now have some dedicated banking people who are really going out to sell our services to these banks for money transfer.", "But on the other side as well with Yodlee, we're offering a bill payment which is real time bill payment online so again, another opportunity for us to expand our payment segment. So both of these initiatives are doing well and we're very focused on our banking strategy in terms of making banks particularly in the United States a part of our network.", "In Europe and other parts of international, we have banks. It's about 75% of our locations are banks and post offices, but now this really broadens the portfolio for us.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Any general view in terms of what the pricing relationships or the commission structures look like with the banks?", "Christina Gold", "Very much the same. We basically have no favorites. We love them all. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [James Castain \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch]", "[James Castain \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch]", "Can you provide a little more color on China and how you can rejuvenate your business there? It's not growing much and I know the economy is weak, but it's such a huge opportunity.", "Christina Gold", "I think with China, we have a great team over there in China, but what we've done now is we've basically carved China into regions as opposed to looking at it as one big country. When you think of the size of China, just from an operating point of view, Hikmet's team has really carved it out into different regions who have different types of consumers and different types of needs.", "And then they've connected with the right send and receive. Part of China's send and receive, some of it is coming from the Middle East. Some of it is coming from the west. Really looking at the corridors and identifying what the needs that they have, and doing a lot of grass roots work.", "I think also, we had seen tremendous growth in India and the knowledge of the team from India is really going to be transported to assist the team in China and really rethink some of our strategy because in India we have over 50,000 locations. In China, we have 25,000.", "Although that's good, when you think of the population, we need a much greater reach, so the team is focused on doing that as well. So I think yes, we have to deal with the small business and find the right solution there, and some of that is going to be driven by the recession. But as we look at really the remittance business, we are looking at a new sort of go to market strategy for that business.", "[James Castain \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch]", "In your release you mentioned that the U.S. outbound business was stabilizing. Do you think it's bottomed out at this point?", "Christina Gold", "It seems to be doing okay. I think we're pretty pleased with it. I think one of the things we saw in the U.S. is the Hispanic consumer is a consumer that we're seeing has had the most pressure and as you look at unemployment and a lot of factors, that consumer for us has been really challenged. So the U.S. outbound is much more broad based and I think we feel that one is holding pretty well.", "[James Castain \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch]", "The opportunity associated with commissions and you talked about pricing being down minus 2% instead of minus 1%. Can you give us kind of quantifying commissions, what the margin opportunity is longer term?", "Christina Gold", "I think on the commission you saw I think we came in at 55.7% for the quarter so we felt very good about that when you see where we were last year,. In terms of the pricing, we haven't finalized everything on the pricing because we're at about 1.5%, so it could be 2%, it could be 1.7%. It really depends on as we look at some of these corridors that we have countries like Indonesia and Malaysia where we really don't have large share, but where we have a huge opportunity. So if we put the pricing right, we can really go in there and really lift a lot of business out.", "Gary Kohn", "Just for a clarification, I think you got that the 55% isn't the commission level. It's part of the cost of services.", "[James Castain \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch]", "I'm just curious longer term, is it a one point opportunity here, a two point opportunity or is there a push back from the agents?", "Christina Gold", "It's a balancing act. I think what we've tried to do on all of the new ones, especially on the receive side, set up a better rate of commission because they obviously know the size of the business they're going to get and the volume and the value of the brand. So we've been working on it consistently. You'll see it coming through in our numbers.", "But these contracts are a five year duration so sometimes it takes awhile before it flows through into the system, so it's a point of focus. We have a target every year and the team is actively going after it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "Thanks very much for the disclosure on the impact on Slide 17. I'm curious about, you talked about lower principal. Is that captured in the mix component of the difference between transactional revenue growth?", "Scott Scheirman", "That would be part of it. The overall mix as we think about the change from transaction growth to revenue growth.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "So in mix we've got geography, we've got intra versus inter and we've got lower principal all kind of embedded with that?", "Scott Scheirman", "All embedded within that, yes. And that's been running relatively consistent, that mix difference compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "Are those three factors broadly equal? No precisely, but broadly?", "Scott Scheirman", "We haven't provided that level of detail, but just to say that suffice, the three of those are making up the mix difference. I believe on the principal transaction, a number of individuals may think that has a huge, huge impact on revenues for transactions. It has some impact on the revenue for transaction but you've got to remember that we price in bands so a lot of our bands run in bands of $100 or $200 so it may take awhile for a transaction to cross a fee band.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "It's really interesting to see how many different initiatives you have in terms of new channels in particular. Is your experience thus far that those channels are really going to be additive to your existing business? To what extent are you seeing cannibalization or kind of shift from traditional channels to some of these new channels?", "Christina Gold", "I think that we saw right from the very beginning on dot come about 50% to 60% of the business was incremental, so we know that. I think when we look at the account to cash in the banking system, that's pretty much all incremental because some of those transactions, banks were doing them to some degree with difficulty, and now it's actually a much faster transaction.", "So a lot of it is incremental. It's not cannibalizing the business and so even on the mobile front, it's a much smaller transaction. It's a different consumer. So I think what we're doing is broadening our base and giving ourselves a bigger customer footprint to work with.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "I think that's really both interesting and important because obviously these technology based alternatives or challenge based alternatives have for a long time been seen as a real risk for the company and I think what you're really telling us is that these are primarily in fact additive. Is that fair?", "Christina Gold", "That's fair. And I think it just broadens our opportunities and really puts us toe to toe with any of the competitive offerings out there.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "Going back to Jim's question on agent commissions and you talked about new contracts with agents. Is there something where in future you can structure these contracts such as when volume ramps up with a new agent, the commission rate would automatically come down as opposed to having to renegotiate as volume goes up?", "Christina Gold", "We have different types of arrangements and some of them actually it goes in reverse. As they drive a certain level of productivity they get a higher level of commissions. So we do have performance based commission contracts as well. So it varies across the globe based on the volumes, based on the type of location. So we can manage that.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "Obviously tremendous operating cash flow performance. Even being aggressive with your CapEx, buy backs and acquisition assumptions, you're still left with a lot of excess cash. Any thoughts on where your preference would be there? Would it be debt pay down? Would it be more buy backs? Anything you can say there?", "Scott Scheirman", "We're pleased with our cash flow. The $357 million in the first quarter and we're on tract to at least $1.1  billion in 2009. As we think about our capital structure, we're going to continue to target a capital structure that's consistent with A-A3, so that would leave us right around that $3 billion of debt.", "And then just the operating, the global operating environment we're in right now, we feel like it's very prudent from a liquidity standpoint to be very solid there. We have been solid, but we continue to want to be solid, so we'll continue to look at opportunities in the market place. We periodically review our capital structure internally and with our Board, and will continue to make sure we've got strong liquidity.", "We'll invest in the business. We've got an eye to some acquisitions, and then we're targeting $400 million of stock buy back and we're right on target. We're $100 million into that through the first quarter.", "Franco Turrinelli \u2013 William Blair", "Any discussions at the Board level on dividend levels?", "Scott Scheirman", "We periodically have those discussions with our Board and will continue to have those discussions and clearly investing in the business is very important to us, but also providing a very solid return to our shareholders is important. So we'll continue to have those discussions and weigh the priorities and our capital structure and our use of cash.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The FEXCO acquisition closed in February, is that right?", "Scott Scheirman", "That's correct. The FEXCO acquisition closed in February.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Can you just remind us about the accounting? Was there any impact to revenues from the timing of that deal closing?", "Scott Scheirman", "No there wasn't. Today and even before the acquisition those revenues were really already recorded on our books and with the FEXCO acquisition we acquired the money transfer business so we did not acquire any non money transfer assets as part of that acquisition. And the impact overall first quarter was pretty nominal since we owned it about five or six weeks in the first quarter.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On the margins, how should we think about the distribution going forward? I know that the prior expectation was for the back half to be higher than the first half. Have you got pretty good numbers in the first quarter? Should we expect second quarter to be lower due to Mother's Day and then maybe a lift in the third quarter and then fourth quarter would be down because of holiday marketing spending? How does the timing of the other technology fall in the marketing distribution as well?", "Scott Scheirman", "The margins will vary by quarter. In the first quarter we're at 28% and we're targeting a full year margin right around 27% so quarter by quarter the margins will be different and by default, some of the quarters will probably be a little bit below that 28% mark as we manage to a 27% margin on a full year basis.", "Also what will vary to some extent is the revenue performance through the year, but we continue to make investments around Mother's Day. There's a number of key holidays in December and then Ramadan so we'll continue to invest behind that. So a full year basis, I encourage you to think about we're targeting a margin right around 27%. But again, it will be balanced with investments and the revenue performance as we move through the quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I want to ask about South Asia because it held up so well despite all that negative press around the destruction going on in the Gulf states. How big is the Middle East or the Gulf coast now exactly? Can you give us some rough sketch of that and what kind of trends are you seeing there in recent weeks?", "Christina Gold", "We don't disclose the size of the Middle East but the Middle East itself is 43% of our business. We continue to see strong growth coming out of the Middle East. It has moderated somewhat from Q4 but I think to put it in perspective, Saudi Arabia is the second largest end market in the world. The U.S. is number one and then it's Saudi Arabia, so you can see just how large and important it is.", "It tends to be a lower principal and a lower revenue per transaction, but a very high volume business.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "It sounds like maybe a little bit for them but not much material change there.", "Christina Gold", "No. But I think as we look through the year, we're balancing all of the needs that we're looking at. We're looking at all of our big growth engines and just monitoring those because we want to make sure that we really have a good feel for what's happening in the market place.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I guess U.S. Bank, what ultimately drove the deal in your direction? I believe this partnership was previously your largest competitor so what created the opportunity? Was this a competitive situation? Was there a bidding process? I'm just trying to better understand how that came about and secondly if you can also just talk about the pipeline for other direct partnerships with banks especially in the U.S.", "Christina Gold", "I think one of the things that Stewart and his team has been very focused on a banking strategy for the U.S. It's something that we've looked at for some period of time. But he really mobilized the team and himself to go and make that happen. I think we really offered a tremendous brand. 379,000 locations, great compliance which is very important. So I think all the attributes of our business were important to them in making that decision.", "And, the ability to also drive traffic, to really give them customers and business and then also the technological capabilities that we can offer as we move along in this relationship with account to cash and other alternatives.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And the pipeline for banks?", "Christina Gold", "Obviously it's everything is in our line of sight. Obviously Fidelity, that relationship is going after a certain group of smaller banks, but we have a number of others in the line of sight so look to more announcements over the next period of time.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "The revenue guidance, 2% to 5% decline starting out at a good pace here in the first quarter, any change in your confidence level to hit the 2% to 5% decline for revenues in '09?", "Christina Gold", "I feel good about the guidance. I feel confident in where we are. I think that we had a great first quarter looking at where we came out in Q1. But I do recognize that there's a lot of unknowns out there in the market place and we're trying to balance all of that with some orders like countries like Spain and Russia are more difficult.", "But then we have the strength of the Middle East and also some European countries are also strengthening. So we're balancing all of our different businesses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I have a question about the foreign exchange revenue. Is there anything that's either making it more difficult for you to earn a spread or creating an opportunity for you to earn maybe an outside spread given some of the volatility in the currency?", "Scott Scheirman", "No, not at all. As we talked about pricing and so forth whether it's FX spread, that's all considered in our overall pricing equation. But we manage that very carefully and very closely every day with our agents and continue to earn spreads that we believe are competitive and allow us to drive, for example in the first quarter C to C transaction growth of 7% and internationally outside of the U.S. grew transactions 16%. So really no impediment in driving the business with FX.", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I don't mean so much from the volume standpoint, but your ability to actually control that spread.", "Scott Scheirman", "It's part of the pricing equation if you will and we have the ability to set those spreads every day and don't have any challenges in doing that. It's a very competitive market place and we're competitive out there, but we have the ability to set the spreads where we like to.", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "When you look at the correlation with global unemployment and in your business, have you seen a massive lag effect to that or is it a quarter or two? I'm just wondering, you're starting to see the global unemployment really start to head higher and I'm wondering if you've actually see a real slowdown potentially in volumes yet.", "Christina Gold", "I think our business is very mixed in terms of what drives what. Recognizing that our customers need to send money, so what we do see is lower principal. We see fewer transactions, but there's not one criteria that says this correlates directly to our Western Union transactions or revenue growth.", "There are certain countries, let's say Spain where we know unemployment right now is running at 15.5% and it was a highly construction focused economy. That we saw hit about a year ago. But in other countries it's really very mixed so it's not unemployment. It's just our customers what they end up doing is going to other jobs or fewer hours, but they really need to send money.", "This is food and lodging and helping their families survive. So I think you cannot just say it impacts our customers, but it is not one factor that drives our business results.", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "If I adjust for the potential marketing spending that you could have done at 5% this quarter, it looks like there was only about a penny in earnings anyway. Does that sound about right to you?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes. 1% of revenue is probably in the neighborhood of $12 million, so yes.", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So even if you had spent at that level, you still would have posted a pretty strong number.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes. There are some other investment timing in their but we're trying to keep our investments relatively consistent to drive a 27% margin. But there is some marketing and some other investments within the year.", "Christina Gold", "I would also add that with our YES campaign, the team has done a terrific job in using common materials, doing shots like 20 commercials in one shot, really maximizing how we do it and how we go to market. So that's going to give us tremendous savings going forward. So we're getting more bang for the buck. So that's also very important in terms of what the marketing team has been able to do.", "Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You previously said FEXCO would be $0.2 diluted. Is it now expected to be kind of flat to accretive to you this year or slightly diluted?", "Scott Scheirman", "It will still be slightly diluted so within our outlook there's that $0.02 dilution, so that's still our view on FEXCO.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "The FEXCO acquisition, the payment services directive, what kind of competitive moves are you seeing? It does open up and certainly you are aggressively moving after that market but what are you seeing on the competitive side? It should open up some opportunities for others.", "Christina Gold", "I think right now we're not seeing too much activity because recognizing that that goes into effect in November of 2009. For us we're really geared up and ready to roll because we already have the network. We have the compliance capability and we have the brand. So it's not something that you can walk in and just turn on a switch.", "Europe is highly regulated and there's an awful lot to do so I think there's a lot to be done before a lot of the competitors will come in. I think also what we have now is a dedicated sales force who have experiences and knows what to do, who are out there right now targeting opportunities for us so when this comes through we're ready to roll.", "Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Do you have a feel for how many locations that you will be able to add?", "Christina Gold", "I would tell you it's quite substantial. Over the next couple of years it's quite substantial and I think the pay back on this extra acquisition and what we can accomplish with this is going to be very good.", "Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "On the U.S. bank market, banks have always been viewed as potential competitors and you're making more of them partners. You said 75% of your locations outside the U.S. are at banking locations. What percentage of that is within the U.S. and can you quantify?", "Christina Gold", "In the U.S. it's very, very small. It's not even material so it's not anywhere near that. I think that it has always been a challenge for us and the banks basically want to white label our brand and we won't do it. So they want us to offer them service but call it whatever they want to call it.", "I think an interesting case is Scotia bank. They did a lot of research when they were looking to go into the money transfer business because they wanted to attract the ethnic consumer into the bank and as they looked at how to do this, they finally recognized you need a network. You need the knowhow on both sides of the transaction in terms of ethnic marketing and also all of the compliance. ", "And they called up and said, \"This is the only way we're going to get it done.\" So I think a lot of banks are rethinking their strategy and really coming to us as the experts in the field to really help them get this done.", "Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "And FIS was not working with anybody else prior to your relationship?", "Christina Gold", "No, not that I'm aware of.", "Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Now that you're more into mobile, do you have any updated thoughts on the economics of mobile and the opportunity around mobile?", "Christina Gold", "I think mobile is a long term opportunity. Mobil, it tends to be a principal that's below $50 so you've got a very small amount of principal that's moving. Right now we have it in selective markets like the Philippines we're doing it. We're working in the Middle East, so we have it and we're working with [Votophone] in Africa.", "So we're learning. this is a learning mode as opposed to really knowing exactly the element of each thing but it is possible because you're basically looking a lower principal but you still have profit on that transaction and business here requires volume. You've got to drive a lot of transactions.", "But I think longer term as well as we talked earlier, this is an opportunity for us to get into inter in China and India, and that will be very important to us in the future.", "I just wanted to thank everybody for being on the call today. We're delighted with the quarter and as always I want to thank all of the employees of Western Union for all that they do every day, and our agents, and just appreciate your time on the call and look forward to talking with you next quarter.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call Mr. Michael Salop - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Salop", "Thank you and good morning. I am pleased to have recently joined the company and I look forward to working with everyone in the future. Today's call will include comments from Christina Gold, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Christina will provide a brief overview of the third quarter, Scott will give a more detailed review of the financial results, and then Christina will update you on the company's strategic initiatives. After the comments, we will have time for your questions.", "As we indicated in our press release, we have prepared slides to accompany this call and Web cast. These slides are available at www.WesternUnion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call.", "Before turning the call over to Christina, I want to remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2008 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. ", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. We have reconciled those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures on our Web site, www.WesternUnion.com, under the Investor Relations section. ", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims any responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "Thank you and welcome to our third quarter call. ", "The company delivered solid results in the quarter with reported revenue of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $0.26, or $0.33 excluding a charge for an anticipated settlement involving the State of Arizona. As you are probably aware, the legal and regulatory environment in Arizona has been challenging for our company for a number of years. ", "During the quarter we accrued $71.0 million related to an anticipated regulatory settlement. The anticipated settlement includes resolution of all outstanding legal issues and claims of the State of Arizona, as well as a multi-state agreement to fund a not-for-profit organization which will promote safety and security along the entire U.S. and Mexico border.", "We have always had common policy goals with Arizona but have differed on the best procedures to achieve these goals. Our objective is to move forward without the uncertainty surrounding this issues, as well as to contribute to improving conditions along the border.", "The legal matters date back to 2003 and the compliance procedures involved are not an issue today. Over the years, we have made significant improvements to our compliance program, which we believe are the best in the industry. The agreement is not yet finalized but we anticipate completion before the end of the year. Scott will give details on the settlement accrual in his financial review.", "Turning to the business, in the third quarter we were pleased with our operational performance as transaction and revenue trends were consistent with the second quarter. The geographic diversity of our business enables us to shift investments in response to changing economic conditions. ", "C2C revenue declines 5% in the quarter, or declined 3% constant-currency adjusted, on 3% transaction growth. ", "Average revenue and principal amount per transaction were consistent with the levels experienced in the first half of the year. Our objective is to gain market share and we believe we have continued to make progress on this goal in 2009.", "On a regional basis Europe, Middle East, Africa, and South Asia posted a revenue decrease of 3% with 8% transaction growth. Western Europe experienced consistent transaction growth whereas compared to the second quarter, while Spain and Russia continued to be challenging markets in the region. The Gulf States delivered strong transaction growth, although growth moderated compared to the second quarter. In India revenue grew 8% and transactions increased 16%.", "We completed several agent signings in the region, including Quick Money SA in Morocco, which operates 1,500 locations, Oolu[?] Exchange in the United Arab Emirates, and Sonali Bank, which is the largest government sector bank in Bangladesh. The Tartar Sand Post in Russian, which as the potential to add 1,000 locations, also joined the network.", "The Americas region experienced a 10% revenue decline and a 4% transaction decrease. These rates showed slight improvement from the second quarter. Mexico results were stable relative to the second quarter as revenue declined 18% and transactions declined 13% in the quarter. While Vego and our independent class of trade underperformed market data, our larger regional and national agents performed in line. Our U.S. outbound business, the largest revenue component of our Americas region, continued to post stable transaction trends. ", "In the Americas we are executing on our go-to-market strategy, which includes growing the network through the banking class of trade, introducing new products with the expanded prepaid programs, and repositioning of our domestic money transfer business through pricing, targeted marketing on customer segment expansion.", "The U.S. domestic money transfer business declined 15% in revenue and 9% in transactions in the quarter and has exhibited negative trends for an extended period. In the fourth quarter we are implementing a repositioning of our domestic money transfer business. On October 1 we implemented new domestic pricing that established standardized national prices and brought more consistency relative to U.S. outbound pricing. We launched a marketing blitz around the new pricing campaign and we will continue with significant promotional activity throughout the holidays.", "The repositioning is designed to drive accelerated customer usage and improvement in transaction growth in the U.S. domestic market. The price actions are included in our 2% pricing reduction outlook for the year and we believe this is the right repositioning to turn around our domestic money transfer business.", "Moving to Asia Pacific, revenue in the quarter increased 5%, with a 15% increase in transactions. China's trends improved relative to the first half, with transaction and revenue growth of 7%. Our strategies to drive growth are beginning to pay dividends. Our targeted market efforts reflect an enhanced understanding of the diverse groups within China and the distinct related send locations.", "We were pleased to renew our agreement with the Agricultural Bank of China with an additional 15,000 locations expected by 2011. Once activated these additions will bring our total location count in China to approximately 40,000.", "We are further developing other Asian countries with promising long-term growth characteristics. Indonesia is a prime example. The country represents a top 20 inbound remittance market. During the third quarter we had strong transaction growth in Indonesia and we launched our 10,000th agent location in the country.", "We strongly believe Asia is a great long-term opportunity for us as it represents 20% of the global remittance market but only 8% of Western Union's revenue.", "The Philippines remains an important market, although transaction growth moderated from the second quarter, given the country's connection to the Gulf States. ", "As you are aware, many parts of the Philippines have encountered devastating flooding brought by tropical storm, Ketsana. The Western Union Foundation and our regional operating center in the Philippines have begun a number of initiatives to assist in relief and reconstruction efforts. The Western Union Foundation is also contributing to emergency response to the hardships inflicted by disasters in Indonesia, Samoa, and India.", "Turning back to the business, globally we continue to focus on growing our core through a variety of channels, including our intra-country transfers, WesternUnion.com and Account to Cash. Each of these channels represents less than 2% of existing company revenues but they are growing rapidly and offer significant opportunity. Our intra-country money transfer business outside the U.S. grew transactions at a double-digit rate in the quarter.", "The .com service is available in 14 send countries, including the top five European send markets. The profitable and high-growth channel posted double-digit transaction growth in the third quarter, including over 40% transaction growth internationally.", "Our Account to Cash transactions have grown more than 60% year-to-date with 10 banks currently offering the service. Account to Cash provides Western Union connectivity to millions of account holders, many of whom are new to our brand. As we focus on expanding partnerships with banks, we expect our Account to Cash offering to become a more significant part of our business.", "Turning to global business payments, revenue declined 3% while transactions increased 2%. Revenues were aided by $8.0 million from the Custom House acquisition, which closed on September 1. ", "Our consumer bill payment offering in the U.S. provides same-day bill payments through our relationships with more than 4,000 billers. We can leverage these relationships in our systems to offer convenience to mainstream bank consumers, as well, and we are pleased that Western Union's expedited bill payment services is now being offered to Wells Fargo online banking customers.", "Overall, we were pleased with the company's operational performance in the third quarter as revenue and transaction trends stabilized.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Scott for a more detailed financial review.", "Scott Scheirman", "Revenue for the third quarter was $1.3 billion, down 5% on a reported basis, and down 2% constant currency adjusted.", "Custom House added $8.0 million to revenue and had a $5.0 million operating loss, primarily due to acquisition-related expenses, including amortization and integration costs. ", "We reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.26, or EPS of $0.33 excluding the settlement accrual. On a constant-currency basis, EPS excluding accrual was $0.01 lower. EPS of the third quarter of 2008 was $0.33.", "During the quarter the company recorded a pre-tax accrual of $71.0 million related to the anticipated resolution of issues with the State of Arizona and a multi-state agreement to fund a not-for-profit organization. A significant portion of the accrual relates to funding this organization, which will promote safety and security along the entire U.S. and Mexico border.", "In addition, as part of the agreement, the company anticipates committing to make further investments to its compliance programs in the U.S. and Mexico border area over the next two to three years. The incremental EPS impact from these investments is estimated to be less than $0.01 per year over that period.", "We do not expect the terms of the anticipated settlement agreement and the related compliance investments to have a material, adverse impact on the company's future performance. We will work closely with our agents, customers, and other key stakeholders to reinforce confidence in our compliance programs.", "Turning back to the business performance, third quarter transaction fee revenue, which made up 79% of company revenue, declined 5%. Foreign exchange revenue represented 18% of total company revenue and it was flat year-over-year. Both transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue were negatively affected by foreign exchange translation.", "The key trends in the business were consistent with the prior quarter. We experienced year-over-year C2C transaction growth of 3% while the average principal per transaction was down 4%, constant-currency adjusted.", "Revenue and principal amounts per transaction were comparable to the first half of 2009. Most importantly, we find that our customers continue to send money and we believe we gain share in a cross-border of mixed markets. In the third quarter the amount of consumer-to-consumer cross-border principal transfers through our network declined 5%, or was down 1% constant-currency adjusted. For the first nine months the amount declined 5%, or was flat constant-currency adjusted.", "The World Bank custom mix for full year 2009 market for remittances to developing countries will decline 7% to 10% while our AD forecasts a 7% decline for cross-border remittances. These organizations are forecasting slight market growth in 2010.", "Cost of services represented 56.5% of revenue and improved 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2008. Operational improvements enabled the company to maintain strong gross margins despite lower revenue and included the benefits of taking FEXCO direct cost reductions, selected agent commission initiatives, and overall expense management.", "SG&A was 22% of revenue in the quarter as reported, including an impact of 5% related to the $71.0 million settlement accrual. Excluding the accrual, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was consistent with the second quarter. Costs related to the FEXCO and Custom House acquisitions also impacted SG&A trends.", "Marketing totaled approximately 4.5% of revenue for the quarter. Investing in marketing remains a priority for Western Union to build awareness and drive transaction growth and we plan to spend 5% of revenue on marketing for the full year.", "Consolidated operating margin was 21% in the quarter, or 27% excluding the settlement accrual. This compares to 27% in the third quarter of 2008.", "Our cost structure is about two-thirds variable. This fact, combined with headcount reductions, call center relocations, selected agent commission initiatives, and the consolidation of C2C regions, contributed to strong margin performance on an operational basis.", "When the market improves and revenue grows, we believe our business model will support margin expansion.", "The tax rate for the third quarter was 27% compared with 28% in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009 we have benefited from a higher proportion of foreign-derived profits, which are taxed at a lower rate compared to U.S.-derived profits and the effect of tax-efficient strategies implemented in 2008.", "Now turning to our segments, C2C, which was 85% of total revenue, declined 5%. Constant-currency-adjusted revenue was down 3%. Transaction growth was up 3% in the third quarter, in line with the second quarter of 2009. Our international C2C business saw revenue decline 3%, or flat constant-currency adjusted, while transactions grew 6%.", "The portion of the international business representing transactions that originate outside the U.S. saw revenue decline 2%, or growth of 1% constant-currency adjusted on transaction growth of 9%.", "C2C operating margin was 28%, consistent with the comparable period last year. The settlement accrual is not included in segment results.", "The difference between revenue and transaction growth rates for the C2C segment was approximately 8%. The difference was primarily due to currency translation, geographic mix, product mix between intra- and cross-border transfers, and pricing. Currency translation totaled about \u00bc of the difference. The combined impact from the other factors has remained generally consistent with recent quarters. The company continues to expect pricing decreases for the full year to be approximately 2% of revenue.", "Our global business payment segment, which includes results from the recently completed Custom House acquisition was 13% of Western Union's revenue in the quarter. Segment revenue declined 3%, or declined 7% excluding Custom House.", "The operating margin was 24%, although excluding the Custom House acquisition, it would have been consistent with last-year's margin at 26%. In the near future segment margins will continue to be impacted by Custom House-related costs, including investments to grow the business.", "The company's financial position, as demonstrated by our cash balance, cash flow generation, and our A-/A3 credit ratings remain strong. ", "In the third quarter we repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average price of $18.19 for a total of $125.0 million. ", "Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $958.0 million, capital expenditures were $67.0 million, and stock repurchases totaled $225.0 million. We now expect our full-year capital expenditures to be closer to $100.0 million than $150.0 million. ", "We continue to target full-year share repurchases of $400.0 million. ", "As expected, on October 1 Western Union received cash from First Data, which was invested in a portfolio in a portfolio supporting our retail money order business. Beginning in the first quarter of 2009 these investments, which should average approximately $800.0 million, will appear as settlement assets on our balance sheet with related increase in settlement liabilities.", "We remain our prudent investment philosophy by investing in high-rated, liquid debt securities.", "At quarter end we had $1.6 billion of cash on hand, with slightly more than half in the United States and $3.0 billion of debts. Our nearest debt maturity is November 2011 and we also have a fully-available $1.5 billion line of credit that expires in 2012.", "The company has narrowed its revenue and EPS outlook to the higher end of its previous expectations, excluding the impact of the settlement accrual. The company now expects the following full-year 2009 financial results, including Custom House:", "Constant currency revenue to decline 1% to 2%; GAAP revenue to decline 4% to 5%; GAAP operating income margin of approximately 25%, or approximately 27% excluding the settlement accrual; GAAP EPS of $1.15 to $1.20, or $1.23 to $1.28 excluding the settlement accrual; constant currency EPS $0.01 lower; cash flow from operations to exceed $1.1 billion; and a tax rate of 25% to 26%.", "Our previous outlook was for constant current EPS of $1.16 to $1.26 and GAAP EPS of $1.18 to $1.28, which did not include the diluted impacts of $0.08 from the settlement accrual or $0.01 from the Custom House acquisition. In the current outlook Custom House positively impacted revenues by less than 1%.", "Through nine months of 2009 operating income margin, excluding the settlement accrual, was 27.5%, while our full-year outlook is approximately 27%. Key operating reasons for the fourth quarter margin include the timing of marketing and investment spending. For example: marketing spending is more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter to support the holidays, including the additional investment behind the domestic business; a full quarter of Custom House amortization and integration costs and investments for growth; and the retail money order conversion, which will negatively impact operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter due to investing the float in tax exempt securities. ", "Although the conversion negatively impacts operating margin, the overall EPS impact will be minimal, as there are offsets in interest income expense and the tax rate.", "In addition, foreign exchange rates may also swing against operating margin percentages relative to the first nine months. Although a weakened dollar benefits top-line revenue, our foreign-denominated profits are largely hedged so the margin percentage may be negatively impacted.", "Our outlook does not include any impact from our patent infringement lawsuit against MoneyGram. As you may be aware, a jury recently awarded Western Union $16.5 million in damages from MoneyGram for infringing on our patented money transfer by phone service. And since the verdict is still being contested by MoneyGram, we have not included the $16.5 million award in our outlook.", "I will now turn the call back to Christina for an update on our growth initiatives.", "Christina Gold", "Our priority growth initiatives stem from one central strategy, growing a profitable portfolio of complementary businesses which extends our leadership position in moving money around the world quickly and in a compliant manner. These five key initiatives include banking, the payment services directive in Europe, business-to-business cross-border payments, prepaid, and mobile.", "Our banking strategy is gaining momentum. The large bank relationships that are currently operational are performing well and early experiences indicate they are bringing new customers to Western Union. In fact, in the first year of these relationships, over half of the transactions involve customers who had not used Western Union during the prior 12 months.", "Banks, which were nearly non-existent in our U.S. and Canadian network a year ago, now represent over 10% of our location distribution in those countries and the pipeline is encouraging.", "U.S. Bank is operational. We are preparing to launch Pittsburgh locations. And Fidelity National Information Services has begun signing relationships with small and medium size financial institutions. In the European Union, the payment services directive is effective on November 1 and we received approval for our license from the U.K. regulatory authorities. ", "We have integrated the sales force and operational infrastructure acquired through FEXCO and we are utilizing this platform to grow in Europe. Through PSD we expect to attract additional customers while expanding the classes of trade that offer money transfer services in countries that previously limited our agents to banks and post offices. We recently signed three letters of agreement with Ortel, Pay Up, and LaGardere, providing the potential for 15,000 additional retail locations throughout Europe.", "In the global business payment segment, we completed our Custom House acquisition on September 1. Custom House offers small- and medium-sized businesses exceptional customer service, reliability, and competitive pricing when making cross-border business payments. We estimate this market for SMEs to generate global revenue comparable to, or larger than, the consumer-to-consumer money transfer market.", "With a proven track record of success, we are glad to have the Custom House team on board as we focus on integrating and expanding this scalable opportunity. We are investing now in order to more deeply penetrate existing markets, adding sales offices and staff in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Australia. We are also enhancing our Web site capabilities and preparing to open offices in new markets.", "Custom House offers exciting opportunities across a wide range of geographies and we are well on our way to establishing the platform for growth.", "In prepaid, our testing over the course of the past few months has provided valuable information for us to expand our offerings. We currently have two reloadable prepaid programs in the market. First, our MoneyWise Visa prepaid card provides a strong value proposition to consumers, particularly the underbanked. This card enables consumers to add money conveniently, including the ability to load a Western Union money transfer directly onto the card.", "Our new prepaid Visa Gold Card has all of the same great benefits of the MoneyWise program and it integrates our industry-leading Gold Card Rewards. We continue to pilot both programs and are expanding them through a variety of marketing efforts, including direct mail, online email, and in retail locations.", "Cash-to-cash money transfer remains a dominant preference among the consumers moving money today. However, mobile is emerging as a complementary channel for money transfer and there is a long-term opportunity in transforming mobile phones into virtual Western Union locations.", "The potential of mobile money was recently described in an economist article which highlighted the success of Safaricom and Pesa. This rapidly growing offering provides intra-country mobile money transfer within Kenya. This is a somewhat unique situation where the leading network operator and mobile wallets have been widely adopted. We are actively participating in the Kenya opportunity through cross-border mobile money transfer. ", "We have expanded our service with Vodafone and sister company, Safaricom. We now have more than 40 Western Union locations in the U.K. where consumers can send money directly to the phones of more than 6.0 million Safaricom subscribers with M-pesa wallets. We are targeting all the major Kenya send locations in the U.K. and by year end we expect to have 80%, or 2,000, of these key locations enabled for mobile transfer.", "The Philippines is another one of the few countries currently equipped with mobile wallets. Through partnerships with Smart and Globe we enacted pilots for mobile transfers to that country from the U.S., UAE, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We also plan to expand connectivity in these markets in the fourth quarter.", "In addition, we recently announced an alliance with Maxis, a major mobile operator in Malaysia. We are working together to launch a service in 2010 that will allow the 11.0 million Maxis subscribers to send money cross-border remittances directly from their mobile phones. Recipients will have the ability to pick up the funds in cash at any Western Union location in over 200 countries. This represents the first Western Union offering of cross-border remittances from a mobile phone for worldwide cash payouts.", "Western Union is well positioned in mobile money transfer. Our current trials already provide access to more than 14.0 million subscribers who have phones enabled for money transfer in Kenya and the Philippines. Western Union provides flexibility and convenience in the transfer process, whether it's an agent location, a computer terminal, a mobile phone, or a prepaid card, our infrastructure connects it all.

We have delivered solid results in a challenging environment and key operational trends have stabilized. We remain focused on gaining market share, and we believe we are, with a world-class brand, 400,000 agent locations, strong balance sheet and cash flow, encouraging progress on key growth initiatives, including our banking strategy, retail expansion in Europe, business-to-business payments and great strides on our channel strategy, including mobile, Account to Cash, WesternUnion.com, and intra-country money transfer.

And we will take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Greg Smith - Duncan Williams.", "Greg Smith - Duncan Williams", "Christina, you talked about prepaid. I was hoping you could expand a little on that and what you think the market opportunity is and how the play out for Western Union.", "Christina Gold", "As you look at the market for prepaids it's in the billions of dollars. It's a very large category and what we're trying to determine exactly is what space are we playing in and we really are trying to look at our customers and see a couple of things. ", "Firstly, we are looking prepaid as an alternative in terms of using it for home delivery and direct to consumers. And that's one of the tests that we're doing with the MoneyWise card, and we're seeing good uptake on that and good performance there.", "And then the other piece of it is how do we expand our Gold program, where we have about 8.0 million consumers in the U.S. on the Gold card, and can we move them over to the prepaid, and we're seeing uptake on that as well.", "So I would say that as we come into 2010 we will be in a better position to clarify exactly the size that we are looking at because we are testing a lot of alternatives. But preliminary, we are very pleased with what we see. We also see good metrics in terms of profitability and in terms of return for the company, so we're not giving ourselves a difficulty in terms of margin. ", "So I think all of the things are lining up extremely well and as we bring our plans to you for 2010 we can give you a little more detail on that.", "Greg Smith - Duncan Williams", "Just a few more comments about the payment services directive. You have obviously had some nice announcements, the new agents. Have things met your expectations on that front and progressing as you expected or has there been an stumbling or roadblocks in any way?", "Christina Gold", "It's gone really well because there are a couple of things. Firstly, the acquisition of FEXCO has been an important part of this and our integration has been excellent. And then with the 15,000 announcement, and the letters of agreement, that was something we are very pleased with.", "But certainly we see there is a lot more runway to grow here so our team is working actively to sign up more locations so look for more news from us over the next couple of months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta \u2013 Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Scott, you mentioned as far as margins and why they would be down in the fourth quarter and I think you mentioned three things. And I was just trying to understand on the marketing side, is it this fourth quarter? Will you be marketing more this fourth quarter than you have previously or is this normal for seasonal?", "And then on the money order, the negative impact you are going to have in the fourth quarter, would that also play out for the remaining three quarters as well, or can you talk about how that might work.", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure. Let me first start with money order and then I will come back to marketing here in a minute. Money order in simple terms, yes, will play out for the next three quarters in 2010 because we've invested those funds in tax-free-type investments, so there will be some geographic issues on the income statements as far as operating income, but we believe the net income will directionally be the same as we have been earning historically.", "And marketing, what you might recall is we entered the year cautious just because of the economic landscape and what 2009 may shape up to be. So actually in the first quarter of the year, we were closer to 4% of our marketing spend, so as we have moved through the year, as we have seen the economy and the markets develop, we are going to invest more in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the year and probably a tad bit more compared to prior year, really in a goal to continue to gain market share, which we believe we've done. But also to support our domestic business.", "But our goal is to invest for growth and continue to gain share as we move forward.", "Kartik Mehta \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Christina, can you talk a little about what you are seeing in terms of immigration trends. If you are seeing them overall improve or remain the same.", "Christina Gold", "It's varied around the globe but I think what we see as we look at the United States in terms of particularly for the U.S./Mexico business, we are not seeing new immigration coming into the country. We are not seeing people leave but there is not a new level of migration in.", "Around the globe I think the one area where we are seeing some exit is from the Middle East. We have seen some reduction in migration but I think that is very much connected to the price of oil, so we may see some uptick and come back as the price of oil goes back.", "So we are not seeing big changes in trend. I think a little bit, we are seeing it in Russian, there are some issues. And obviously Spain continues to be challenged and that is very much driven by unemployment.", "But as we look at our numbers and we look at the World Bank, there is a call for a return to modest growth in 2010.", "Kartik Mehta \u2013 Northcoast Research", "And just one last question. You talked a little about repositioning the domestic business. Do you think is the repositioning the result of just what has happened in the economy or it's because competition has changed? Or there some other factors that are forcing you or wanting you to reposition this business?", "Christina Gold", "I think we've looked at the domestic business having a lot of challenges over the last period of time and clearly a lot of that has come from the economy and also the high percentage of Hispanic consumers within the domestic business. But as we looked at it and we looked at our, let's say pricing, let's say from U.S. to China versus New York to Chicago, there just seems to be some inconsistencies.", "So Stuart's team did an excellent job of doing a lot of research and a lot of work to test different price points and also different points in terms of marketing. We now have a standard pricing and that's really critical for us because as we go to market and whether we advertise in one city or another, we don't have to change anything now. It's a common price point across the country, excellent value. Still premium priced but I think the margin that they put in place, and we are heaving up, we are putting a little bit more than we normally would in the fourth quarter on domestic because we feel it's an opportunity now to go back in and push hard to get people back into the business, to gain market share and be ready for 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Christina, can you talk a little about compliance? I know with the settlement with Arizona higher compliance procedures are in the costs there. Can you talk about what the competition has to do for compliance as well and how that will evolve.", "Christina Gold", "As we look at compliance, we really feel we have the state-of-art and really best-in-class in terms of compliance. And over the years we've invested and really improved our systems more and more. But this is an ongoing process. As you go into new technologies and new products, like prepaid, like mobile, it requires even more investment and so that is something that we have continued to do over the years.", "From a competitive point of view, being the preeminent player in a marketplace you are always the one that people look at to set the standards. And as we look at the issues that we had in Arizona, I think that we all agree in terms of wanting to do the right thing and have a safe and secure border, but maybe not in terms of some of the operational procedures, so we really feel this is something that goes back to 2003 and we are really pleased that we can have a multi-state agreement and put this issue behind us.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And on China, I saw that bounce back nicely to 7%, both in revenue and transactions. Can you give us a little color as to what happened there?", "Christina Gold", "I think it's a couple of things. Obviously, the economy there is starting to bounce back so you see that, which has been a help to us. But also, the team is really focused on the grassroots marketing, we've opened offices in other cities. Really looking at China very much like we looked at how we expanded India. Delighted that we have 15,000 more locations are going to be coming from the Agricultural Bank. So we are going to expand our footprint in China, working on our grassroots, and really pleased to see that 7% revenue and transaction growth in the quarter.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And just overall, I know you took up the guidance to the high end of the range. But just some general comments. Do you believe kind of the worst is behind us and do you think the global economy or the remittance market is starting to recover?", "Christina Gold", "We feel good about the stabilization. I think obviously from second quarter to third quarter was stable and then some markets picked up a little bit so we feel very good about that. Clearly, there are still some challenges in the Middle East, which was the high growth. It's still growing but not at the same pace.", "I think there are different parts of the world are going to have different impacts. There is still the big question in the U.S. on the level of unemployment because that does come to our Mexico quarter. And also the unemployment as it relates to Spain.", "But we see stability and also if we look at the World Bank, they are projecting modest growth for next year versus a minus 7 to minus 10 this year, that augers well for us as we look to the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just expand on Bryan's question, were there any major surprises in the quarter in terms of country or regional performance?", "Christina Gold", "I would say no. I think it's pretty consistent with all of the other quarters. If we look at different countries, there was no major deterioration or things that kind of did not perform consistently. So I think we felt pretty comfortable that things have stabilized for us in our business.", "Scott Scheirman", "And I would add is U.S. outbound trends were consistent with the last few quarters. Western Europe, we're consistent. And those are major send areas for us. Gulf, although the transaction growth rates are stronger, there was some moderation, but C2C transactions, both Q2 and Q3 were 3%. And then the average principal per transaction on a constant-currency basis was down 4%, which was a slight moderation from the second quarter. So the average ticket price is hanging in there, too.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "And on the Mexico front, just the Vego branded underperformance, how much of that is tied to the proactive store closings last quarter versus the other factors? Can you give us an update there?", "Christina Gold", "We're seeing the small retailers and the Vego, that's really where we're seeing the underperformance so obviously it is tied to Vego performance and the small independents. But if we look at our major chains, they are performing up to the market level. So we're not seeing the same number of closures or the same issues that we had in the first half, but obviously it rolls into the second half, because those locations are no longer there. ", "But Stuart and his team are looking aggressively to try to increase the number of independents in the network.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "So the solution is to bend the network from here. Any other changes that might be on the horizon?", "Christina Gold", "For the Mexico business? I think we are looking at in terms of\u2014I think the real issues for that will be a lot related to the U.S. economy and the level of unemployment. We do feel that that is a key indicator that is impacting that business.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Last one for me, Scott, just a housekeeping question. How big was the integration and acquisition expense of Custom House in the third quarter?", "Scott Scheirman", "The loss for Custom House was about $5.0 million in the quarter on $8.0 million of revenue and I would say the majority of the $5.0 million loss was related to both integration costs, but also deal costs, as you pay attorneys and accountants and so forth to close the deal.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "So that should ease as we exit the year, correct?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, it should ease. One of the opportunities we see with Custom House in the B2B space\u2014and we've used the word game changer before. Last quarter when we announced that we believe there are opportunities to invest behind that business, to grow it. And to put it in context, we think that the B2B space, the size of that revenue market, is equal to a greater than size of the C2C revenue market and we've grown that to over a $4.0 billion business, 17% share, so we think Custom House is a good investment opportunity for us to drive investment behind as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Scott, you mentioned that $100.0 million of capex this year. Is that the number we should be thinking about longer term? Is that the normalized level?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, we have historically run in the neighborhood of $150.0 million the last couple of years. This year we're closer to $100.0 million than $150.0 million. And so what I've got in my mind is somewhere maybe 2% to 3% of our top line, which would be $100.0 million- to $150.0 million-type number.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "And the trends in signing bonuses? It seems like your commissions are coming down. It also seems like the signing bonuses have come down somewhat as well.", "Scott Scheirman", "We've been very successful in signing new agents. We crossed the 400,000 agent mark this quarter. We're very pleased with that. We have renewed key agent relationships. We've had no major agent losses. So we feel like we're in a very good spot with our agents and able to renew those and at times get economic terms that are a little more favorable to us.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Christine, the 15,000 retail locations in Europe, those are not in the 400,000 agent count, right?", "Christina Gold", "No. The ones that we announce\u2014we only announce the numbers when they are actually active so they won't even be starting to roll them out until after November so they're not in there at all.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "How quickly do you think these agents can ramp and what is your sense of their productivity versus the post offices and bank channels in Europe?", "Christina Gold", "It will depend in terms of exactly where they are located. Obviously there are some agent locations that are in ethnic communities so that does a quicker ramp up. It's also dependent upon the retail company, whether they're willing to ramp out in the middle of their Christmas time, so we kind of balance their needs with our needs. But we would be going through that as quickly as we could, but it could take a year or so to put them all into place. Depending on the 15,000, maybe you get 5,000 or 10,000. It just depends on the network.", "And the ramp up, normally we see one to three years in terms of productivity, but because these are on the send side and they offer a unique service, because they will have better hours for our customers, I think they should do very well.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Outside of domestic, can you give us a sense of the pricing trends? It sounds like domestic is coming in but you are sticking to the 2% for the year.", "Christina Gold", "Yes. And really, the domestic price change was in that 2%.", "James Kissane \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "So it sounds like international might be a little bit better than what you were thinking about in the beginning of the year.", "Christina Gold", "Well, it varies because it's a mixture of all different quarters and timing but we feel we did do some pricing in international to gain market share but we feel good about our price position and where we are.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS", "I had a question, to follow-up on the payment services directive. As you look out to 2010, since that will really be the first full year of implementation, can you help us frame the potential incremental revenue opportunity here? Obviously you have already signed up a good number of new locations and it sounds like more to come. So any frame of reference for the incremental revenue opportunity would be great.", "Christina Gold", "I think we look at the location count as something that will give us incremental revenue, but in terms of 2010 we will be talking to you early in year in terms of our projections and we will be able to give you a little bit more color in terms of what we expect the PSD to deliver as part of our outlook for 2010.", "Scott Scheirman", "What I would add is where we believe PSD will be helpful in Europe, too, is that it allows us to get retail presence, such as in places as France and Germany, where we traditionally had banks or post banks. Those have been good agents. But what retail will help is the hours of operation and often they speak the language of our customers.", "So we believe on a long-term basis getting into the retail establishments, particularly countries like France and Germany, will be helpful to our business model.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS", "What percent of your agent contracts are up for rebid over the next 12 months and how will that compare with a typical year and does it create any additional opportunities to push on the commission levels a bit? I guess sometimes you do renegotiations but can you talk about that a little bit?", "Christina Gold", "It's really a rolling schedule in four- and five-year increments so there's really not one year with a spike. There are a couple of contracts that come up a few years back that are quite high but we don't have anything major. It's the normal type of renewals that are coming through.", "And we have a waterfall in terms of as the contracts come through, we try to target in terms of commissions and working through that commission rate to bring it to a more effective rate for us.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS", "And lastly, on the balance sheet and capital deployment, I am particularly interested to get your thoughts on the dividend. I know it's pretty small but I guess that means there's room for increase, potentially, but if you can talk about that in the context of the other cash deployment options, I am assuming that you are going to continue to buy back a decent amount and keep your eyes open on the M&A front.", "Scott Scheirman", "Our objectives generate $1.1 billion of cash flow to this year, which is strong, especially in the environment we're operating in.", "And our priorities for cash continue to be to invest in the business. And we spoke about our capex being closer to $100.0 million, which is modest for a company our size. Another priority for cash is really investing in the business. You know, acquiring companies, if you will, such as we've done with FEXCO and Custom House. ", "And then finally, returning value to our shareholders is important, both through stock buyback\u2014we targeted $400.0 million for that\u2014and then on the dividend front, we continue to receive input from investors and others and we have ongoing dialogue with our board on that, so we will continue to evaluate that, the best ways to return cash to our shareholders.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 UBS", "Would we assume that on your next call, since its year end, that's when we might have an update on the dividend situation?", "Scott Scheirman", "Well, we continue to have dialogue at the senior management and with our board. And when we have news on that we will be sure to share it with you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just to push a little bit on the 2010 situation and picking up on the comments that as things begin to improve here you would expect to see some margin expansion. Any way to sort of frame or bracket what type of margin expansion we should be thinking about in this model as you get back to growth into 2010?", "Scott Scheirman", "It's probably a little early to talk real specifically about 2010 in specific terms, but let me give you some of our thinking and how we're thinking about the business. We want to balance strong margins with investing in the business, which is very important for us and our shareholders. If you look at 2009, we are projecting 27% margins, in a year when revenues will be down 1% or 2% on a constant-currency basis.", "We have also made investments in the business with Custom House and FEXCO, which have clearly impacted our margins, but still able to deliver 27%. So as we look at the future, we believe when the market improves, as revenue grows, our business model, to your point, will support margin expansion. But our objective is to deliver strong margins but investing the business for future growth is important. And as I mentioned earlier, Custom House with the B2B space is one of those areas.", "But we have an objective as a management team to have strong margins, for sure.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just for perspective, is there any way to break out the incremental amortization from 2009 versus 2008, just to get a sense on what the additional amortization has been to the overall operating line from both the FEXCO and the Custom House?", "Scott Scheirman", "I don't have that number at my fingertips. I know in the financial schedules we have disclosed what our amortization is year-over-year but let us think about providing that additional detail on a go-forward basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "The changes that you made in U.S. domestic, when do you expect to see that business improve? Is it possible to lay out what specific expectations you have over the next few quarters?", "Christina Gold", "I think, obviously, we will have impact on our revenue line but what we expect to see is a marked improvement in our transaction rate in terms of gaining back share. And we anticipate going back to a positive transaction growth rate in 2010. And we are pleased with what we are seeing already in the month of October so we are confident that we can move this business forward.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "And a longer-term question relative to mobile, do you see that as a fragmented market from the technological perspective. In other words, do you have to build-out a sort of unique set of capabilities for each geography? Or is there more standardized approach where you can use your existing infrastructure that benefits margins also?", "Christina Gold", "I think for us, we're in a unique position, because we can connect to any carrier. So that for us, in terms of technology, for us it is not as complex as it is for the mobile carrier who has to have the right M-wallet in their phone. So we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the channel, particularly across-border, which we have done in Kenya now and we are ramping up that to learn more about that. We have also connected, as well, into the Philippines and we're adding connectivity on our send side. ", "The challenge for us, which is not complex but it's really to make sure we train the people at the point of sale in terms of how to do a mobile transaction. So as we scale this and we drive more locations it will just be another type of transaction. Do you want to send it mobile, do you want to send it overnight, do you want to send it on a prepaid card, or next day? So it's another one of our offerings. So I think we're very uniquely positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. It's really a challenge in the countries. And I think that Safaricom and Enpesa, by having the carrier and the phone enabled, are in a unique position to take advantage of us sending money across. But it's taking time for countries and mobile carriers to get there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "In terms of the new EPS range that you have, that does include the dilutive impact of customer sight[?]", "Scott Scheirman", "Correct.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "And that's about roughly $0.01.", "Scott Scheirman", "You are correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just focusing on 2010 and realizing that your constant currency revenue growth this year is reasonably outperforming what the World Bank is forecasting for the market as a whole. And just looking at the World Bank's forecast for slight growth in 2010, as a baseline how are you thinking about your own top line next and how it relates to what the World Bank has been saying.", "Christina Gold", "We are working our way through it in terms of what the World Bank has been saying, but the other thing to remember, every time they put out a projection, they keep drawing down. So as we look at 2009 we are pleased to see that we are outperforming in terms of the World Bank numbers. Obviously they are looking at a zero to a 3 or 4, so that's where they are. And we're just working through our numbers in terms of where we feel we will be in 2010. And so it's a little bit early for us to give that type of information. But we normally outperform the World Bank.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And I think the Custom House revenue contribution around $8.0 million to $9.0 million?", "Scott Scheirman", "$8.0 million.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And that's just a month's impact. So I was wondering is that a good number to use for a monthly revenue run rate or was there any lumpiness there?", "Scott Scheirman", "No, it think that is a fair 30-day period, the $8.0 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "A follow-up on Custom House. I was hoping you would give a little more color on your growth strategies there and some of the thoughts around the investment dollars that you are planning on putting against that business next year.", "Christina Gold", "We've actually started already in the fourth quarter in terms of what we want to do with Custom House. I think there are a couple of things that we're focused on right now, is really enhancing and expanding some of their offices in key markets like the U.K., Australia, the U.S., where we see that there are opportunities to further penetration. And so one of the keys there is the sales force and so they are training people to go out and sort of feet-on-the-street to drive that traffic, which will give us more growth in 2010.", "Also, on the ecommerce side, we have invested more in terms of the technology for our Internet site, connecting them to the Western Union site. ", "We do have plans, in terms of market roll outs, which from a competitive point of view we really don't want to say where we're going next, but we do have a clear path in terms of what countries and then what level of performance we want to see and then kind of a waterfall of different countries over the next 12 to 18 months. But as we move forward we will be investing to do that. It will require opening of offices and hiring of sales personnel. That's the biggest expense that we do have.", "And the other thing is we want to make sure that they are well trained and continue to perform at the highly professional level that Custom House delivers to its consumers.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "As far as dollars of investments, any color on that?", "Scott Scheirman", "Not at this time. We clearly want to invest. We want to gain market share. Just as we globalized the C2C Western Union international business, we see the same opportunity to globalize the Custom House business over the next two to three to four years, so as we get to the 2010 time frame, in our February earnings call, we'll give you some more color on how we're thinking about Custom House and maybe some of the investments we're considering there.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "As far as mobile goes, further development in Kenya, are you getting any better feel for what the economic model for the mobile is going to look like?", "Christina Gold", "What we're seeing now is a little bit higher average send. It's at about $74. I think when we talked to you a few months back it was in the $50s. In terms of margins, it is margin supportive. I think we are learning a lot about mobile. We don't have the definitive answer because there are very few markets where we can send to.", "The other thing is one of the things that we are seeing, particularly as we look at our UAE, Singapore, and some of the other markets of the Philippines, is how do you get customer acceptance of using that method of distribution or that channel to send money, because there is still a very strong preference to the cash. ", "I think that these are things that we are learning, but it's margin supportive but over the long term I think we feel very good about the metrics but it's still early days yet as we learn about this industry.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray", "On the prepaid business, are you anticipating rolling like a cash-reloadable card out into the retail market and compete with other brands out there like a GreenDot or a NetSpend or a BlackHawk?", "Christina Gold", "We're looking at all kinds of alternatives in terms of the prepaid and I think one of the things right now is we're trying to maximize on the 8.0 million Gold Card consumers that are in our network to see what the advantages of us being able to move them onto a prepaid and get the positive in terms of the positive margin dynamics from that group. But we will look at all different opportunities as we expand our prepaid offering.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Can you give us some idea for transaction trends within some of your key corridors throughout the quarter? Maybe focus on September versus the rest of the quarter.", "Christina Gold", "Our trends have been pretty stable out through the quarter. I think the one thing that is unique in this particular quarter is Ramadan and it shifted, so when you shift Ramadan you shift the trends. But everything came in basically as we expected and so we are feeling very comfortable in terms of our transaction trends.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "And was there any so far into October? You mentioned briefly that you were pretty comfortable with the domestic side. Are you seeing any pick up there or in any of the other key corridors?", "Christina Gold", "We are happy with the domestic side and I think we have given guidance for the rest of the year and we feel confident in the guidance that we've put forward.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "With regard to revenue growth versus transaction growth, it improved in international to a 9-point spread from 13 last quarter, and in domestic it seemed to have gone the other way. It was about 6 points versus 3 last quarter. Can you help explain that?", "Scott Scheirman", "Let me start macro-ly with the overall C2C business, where we saw some narrowing of the spread would primarily be currency, from that standpoint. So on the international business it would have been currency. Other factors that relate to say, geographic mix with intra-pricing, all those type of things, those differences have been relatively consistent the last couple of quarters.", "On the domestic business, there was a little bit of widening of the spread. We did do some selected price reductions in the Q1 and Q2 time frame, that took more of a full impact as we went into the third quarter. Then clearly, on October 1 we just did a repositioning of the domestic business but there was some smaller earlier pricing reductions that we did in domestic that had some of that difference.", "But again, our goal with domestic is to continue to drive growth there and position that business to continue to gain share.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "How have the banks been performing with the [inaudible]. I know you touched on it earlier, but USB\u2014has the transaction volume been comparable to other agents? Have the sizes been comparable? Is there any chance for another large bank sign up in the near term?", "Christina Gold", "What we have seen so far, we are very pleased with what we're seeing from the banks. Obviously we've talked quite a bit over time about Scotia bank becoming 2% of Canadian revenue and now doubling itself in the second year. We're very pleased with the ramp up of US Bank. Right now they're at retail and we're hoping to be able to go Account to Cash when the bank is ready to do that. Fifth Third is just being rolled out as we speak, so again, another opportunity.", "We're seeing really good numbers. On the first year of operation we're seeing about 50% of the customers are new to our business and new to the franchise so that's really incrementality, which is very good.", "So we have a lot of high hopes and a lot of positive opportunities with the expansion in the banking channel. It's now 10% of Canadian and U.S. locations and we expect to expand that over time.", "Christina Gold", "Thank you very much for being on the call today. We really appreciate your time. We were delighted with the quarter. It was a challenging environment but we delivered solid financial results and also really pushed forward in terms of our strategic agenda. So I want to thank our employees and our agents for their continued commitment to our customers.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for todays call Mr. Mike Salop, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Mike Salop", "Today\u2019s call includes comments from Christina Gold, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hikmet Ersek, Chief Operating Officer, and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition to a review of 2009 fourth quarter and full year results, we will discuss our outlook for 2010 and key long term strategies and initiatives. After our comments we will have time for your questions. ", "As we indicated in our press release we have prepared slides to accompany this call and webcast. These slides are available at www.WesternUnion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call.", "I would like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and that our comments include forward looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in our earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the 2008 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements. ", "During the call, we will discuss items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.", "We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website www.WesternUnion.com under the Investor Relations section. All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Christina Gold.", "Christina Gold", "Overall we were very pleased with our 2009 results. Although the global economic environment was challenging our business was stable and we were able to deliver on our financial outlook. We maintained strong margins and generated significant cash flow, demonstrating the strength of our business model. We also advanced key strategic initiatives that open up additional opportunities with new customer and market segments.", "Importantly, we posted another year of market share gains in our C2C business, increasing our cross border remittance market share from 17% in 2008 to an estimated 18% in 2009. We have increased our share by over 300 basis points since 2006 with significant gains each year. ", "Our \u2018Yes\u2019 marketing campaign contributed to the share gains and drove uniformity of the Western Union brand image and marketing. The campaign was launched across 200 countries and territories in over 50 languages and drove strong brand awareness. We saw large jumps in key countries such as Germany which improved unaided awareness by eight percentage points and India where awareness increased to over 90%. The campaign also helped us gain efficiencies in our marketing spend.", "The strategic progress we made in 2009 will drive future growth with both existing customers and new customer segments. This is exemplified by the two strategic acquisitions we made last year; Custom House and the money transfer business of FEXCO. Custom House has allowed the company to establish the position in the large international business to business payments market which is a great growth opportunity.", "We added new banking distribution in the US and made solid end roads in electronic channels. We increased the number of bank agents internationally that offer our account to cash services. Internet transfer through www.WesternUnion.com was expanded to 18 countries and we implemented a learn from pilot programs in mobile and pre-paid. We also took steps to turn around the domestic money transfer business resulting in an increase in domestic transactions in the fourth quarter.", "Our financial position remains strong and our business generated significant cash with $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations in 2009. We deployed this cash through reinvestment in the business, the two acquisitions, share repurchase, and the increased dividend.", "Before we review the year in more detail, I would like to take a moment to say that Western Union is committed to providing support to the disaster relief efforts in Haiti. We have made donations and set up matching gift programs with great support from our agents and employees. We have also temporarily offered transfers to Haiti from the US, Canada, and France with no transaction fee. Our thoughts and hopes go out to everyone in Haiti.", "Turning back to 2009, at the end of last year we implemented an organizational change to help optimize our strategies in 2010 and beyond. Hikmet Ersek, formerly managing director of Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia/Pacific region was promoted to a newly created position, Chief Operating Officer. Hikmet now has responsibility for our overall business units around the world as well as our operations and marketing functions. Hikmet has been a strong leader at Western Union for over a decade. His new organization is designed around further increasing leadership in core money transfer and advancing electronic channels and business to business payments.", "At this time I would like to introduce Hikmet, who will give you a brief review of our fourth quarter business unit\u2019s performance.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I\u2019m very pleased to join you in this new role. In my time at Western Union I have seen it grow from a geographically limited business with 80,000 agent locations to a global market leader with over 410,000 locations. In addition to the core money transfer, I also believe we have great opportunities in electronic channels and in the B2B business. We have a strong leadership team in place around the world and I\u2019m very excited about the future.", "Let me now review the fourth quarter performance of our C2C business segment. In the fourth quarter C2C revenue increased 2% or declined 2% constant currency adjusted. Transactions grew 5% and increased from 3% growth seen in the prior two quarters. This improvement was primarily driven by US domestic money transfer business. Western Union cross border principal declined 3% for the year and was flat constant currency adjusted. For the industry overall the World Bank has forecasted a decline between 5% and 7% for cross border principally in 2009.", "Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia regions delivered revenue growth of 6%. Transactions increased 8% which was the same rate as the third quarter. Improvement in the region in certain markets was offset by a significant decline in growth related to the Gulf States. Western Europe achievement for the company accelerated transaction growth in the quarter. The UK and Germany were especially strong. Spain\u2019s trends, although still negative did improve significantly from the prior quarters.", "We also saw improvement in Russia. The Gulf States experienced positive transaction growth in the fourth quarter, however, the rate of growth slowed significantly driven by employment declines in the region. Transaction growth in the quarter was only in the single digits following strong double digit rates in the first three quarters of the year. The slowdown in the Gulf States is expected to impact 2010 as well. The situation also affects some receive markets such as India which grew revenue at 6% on transaction growth of 8% in the quarter.", "During the quarter we signed several new agencies in the region including Bank Central Popular in Morocco and Capital Financial Holdings in Cameroon. We also renewed with CN Posta Romana and Bank Post, both in Romania, the Industrial Bank of Gabon and Echo Bank in Ghana. For the full year 2009 we made operating profit by 28% an increase 50 basis points from 2008.", "Revenue in the Americas region declined 7% in the quarter while transactions were flat year over year. Both trends improved significantly from the previous two quarters. The improvement in transaction trends was largely driven by domestic money transfer. Stewart Stockdale and his team did a terrific job in creating a new revenue proposition. The effective marketing and promotional programs successfully drove traffic to our agent locations and deplete the dollar for five dollar promotion helped position us in a new principal bank, therefore it\u2019s led to domestic transaction growth of 5% in the quarter with sequential improvement as the quarter progressed.", "As expected, domestic revenue was down 20% as the lower pricing and holiday promotions impacted revenue per transaction. The repositioning program was intended to drive transaction growth quickly as the result in revenue growth in late 2010. We are on track for the turnaround.", "The US business also saw higher transaction growth relative to the third quarter driven by the strength in the Latin America, Caribbean and Asian corridors. In Mexico, revenue declined 10% as transactions declined 12%. While still negative, this represents improvement from the prior two quarters. In the fourth quarter we signed a new agent agreement with Banco Bradesco in Brazil and we renewed a multi-year agreement with Wood Forest Bank in the US.", "The Americas regions operating margin for the full year was 26% down from 27% in 2008 due to revenue declines in the region and the impact of implementing the US domestic strategy. We expect the Americas margin to rebound in 2010.", "In the Asia/Pacific region revenue in the quarter increased 14% on transaction growth of 13%. In China our strategies to promote our brand and increase distribution are working. China trends continue to accelerate with 22% revenue growth and 8% transaction growth in the fourth quarter. Christina and I were recently in China where we finalized an extended agreement with the Postal Savings Bank of China an agent with extensive reach for both urban and rural parts of the country. We also recently completed an agreement in China with the Bank of [Jilin], [Fugan Hashi] Bank and Bank of Harbin.", "In the nation we have entered into convenience store chain with 1,500 locations. The 2009 operating margin for Asia/Pacific was 27% up from 25% in 2008 as revenue growth and the regional consolidation allowed us to further leverage our cost structure. Asia/Pacific is a great opportunity for us relative to our global share we are under presented in this region. I have personally spent a lot of time in Asia and I\u2019m committed to seeing our business realize its full potential in this large market.", "Now moving to our global business segment. Ranjana Clark and her team are focused on obtaining new customers for both the consumer to business and B2B. Global business payments revenue increased 4% in the quarter while transactions decline 4%. Excluding Custom House, segment revenue declined 9%. ", "Our consumer bill payment business primarily based in the United States and heavily linked to the critically sensitive areas of the economy that continued to be challenging. We are focused on acquiring new customers and aiding new billers to stabilize our US walk in and electronic bill payment business.", "Internationally our Pago Facil bill payment business continues to perform well posting transaction growth in the quarter and throughout the year. Our business in Argentina is growing and we continue to expand our biller base and distribution capability in Panama and Peru. Custom House growth was affected in 2009 by declines in global trade flows as we saw lower principal from existing customers. However, custom loyalty and transactions remain strong and the Custom House team continues to have success with new customer acquisition.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Scott to review the financial results for the quarter and our 2010 outlook.", "Scott Scheirman", "Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 2% on a reported basis or decreased 1% constant currency adjusted. Custom House added $23 million to revenue and $5 million of operating loss, primarily due to acquisition related expenses. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.32 on both a reported and constant currency adjusted basis. This compares to $0.34 or $0.37 excluding restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter 2008. ", "For the full year we reported revenue of $5.1 billion down 4% from 2008. In constant currency terms revenue was down 1% which we believe demonstrates the resiliency of our business in a difficult environment. Custom House added $31 million to revenue and $12 million of operating loss for the year.", "GAAP EPS was $1.21 or $1.29 excluding the Arizona and multi-state settlement accrual recorded in the third quarter. Constant currency EPS was a penny lower. In 2008 GAAP EPS was $1.24 or $1.31 excluding restructuring expenses. In my discussion this morning, all margin and cost comparisons will exclude the 2009 settlement accrual and the 2008 restructuring expenses. Please see the earnings release and slides for the GAAP measures and comparisons.", "Consolidated operating margin for the full year was 26.6% excluding the settlement accrual. Margins declined 60 basis points from 2008 as cost of services decreased 80 basis points and SG&A increased 140 basis points. The cost of services improvement was primarily driven by profit improvement actions including agent commission initiatives and savings from the 2008 restructuring. SG&A was negatively impacted by Custom House and FEXCO costs and other expenses.", "Operating margin was 24.2% in the fourth quarter and declined from both 2008 and the first nine months of 2009. As we indicated on our third quarter call, margins for the quarter were expected to be lower relative to the first three quarters of 2009 due to Custom House costs, the US re-pricing, timing of marketing spending, the assumption of the retail money order portfolio, and foreign exchange. Other than currency, the same factors along with FEXCO costs and increased technology investments drove the 420 basis point decline from the prior year.", "Marketing expenses totaled 4.7% of revenue for the year and 5.2% for the fourth quarter. The tax rate was 21.3% in the fourth quarter and 25.0% for the year. Both rates were below prior year levels driven primarily by an increase in foreign derived income and continued benefits from our tax efficient strategies implemented in 2008.", "In our C2C business consumers continue to transfer funds as transactions increased 5% during the fourth quarter. Constant currency average principal per transaction decreased 6% in the quarter. The international C2C business experienced sequential improvements in both transaction and revenue growth rates in the fourth quarter. Trends in Europe and US outbound improved compared to the third quarter offset by significantly softer growth in the Gulf States. International constant currency principal per transaction decreased 5% in the quarter consistent with the third quarter.", "Revenue from the portion of the international business representing transactions that do not originate in the United States grew 8% or 3% constant currency adjusted on transaction growth of 9%. The full year C2C operating margin was 27%. Margin was unchanged from 2008 despite the revenue challenges, reinforcing the resiliency of our model. Fourth quarter C2C operating margin was 26% and was down from prior year in recent quarters. The decrease was the result of the lower domestic pricing and increased marketing, technology investments, FEXCO costs and other expenses.", "Slide 19 shows the components of the three percentage point difference between the revenue and transaction growth rates for the C2C segment in the fourth quarter. A weaker dollar benefited this spread in the quarter by four percentage points but this was offset by domestic and other price reductions and geographic and product mix. Excluding the fourth quarter domestic price reduction, the combined impact of non-currency related items has remained generally consistent in recent quarters.", "For the full year, price reductions were in line with expectations at approximately 2% of consolidated revenue. In global business payments, full year operating margin was 25% or 27% excluding the Custom House acquisition, which compares to 28% operating margin in 2008. C2B margins were negatively impacted by declining volumes.", "Fourth quarter operating margin for global business payments was 20%. Excluding the impact of the custom House acquisitions the segment margin was 26% during the quarter, down 140 basis points from the prior year, driven by the same factors that affected the full year. In 2010 segment margins for global business payments will continue to be impacted by negative US bill payment trends and Custom House related costs and investments.", "Cash flow from operations in 2009 was $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $99 million and we utilized approximately $500 million of international cash for the Custom House and FEXCO acquisitions. ", "During 2009 we repurchased 24.8 million shares at an average price of $16.10 for a total of $400 million and paid $41 million in dividends. At year end, we had $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet with slightly more than half outside the United States and $3 billion of debt. The debt is rated A-A3 with the nearest maturity in November 2011. We also have a fully available $1.5 billion line of credit which does not expire until September 2012.", "Turning to our 2010 outlook, we are expecting a modest recovery in the global remittance market. The economic environment remains challenging and unemployment remains high in major send markets. The November 2009 World Bank report estimated a 1% increase in cross boarder remittance principal in 2010. This estimate was made prior to the end of the year slowing in the Gulf States. We believe many markets have stabilized and some are beginning to show sings of improvement.", "In our C2C business we are targeting continued global market share gains with improvement in transaction and revenue trends relative to 2009. EMEASA and Asia/Pacific are expected to continue with positive transaction growth and improved revenue trends. However, we believe the Gulf States will contribute significantly lower growth in 2010.", "In the Americas, Mexico will still be challenging but we expect the rates of decline to moderate. The US domestic strategy should help the regions transaction trends. Overall for the Americas regions we project revenue will decline but at a lesser rate than 2009. We expect improvement in transaction rates in the region in 2010.", "In global business payments we project the Custom House B2B business will deliver double digit revenue growth driven by increased penetration in existing markets and expansion to new countries. We believe the US bill payment business will remain soft with continued negative revenue and margin trends as we experienced in 2009. Overall, we expect Western Union reported revenue in a range of down 1% to up 2%. Constant currency revenue is anticipated to be one percentage point lower than reported.", "We remain committed to investing in high return growth opportunities in both C2C and global business payments. In total we expect to invest over $50 million of operating expenses in 2010 to support PSD, electronic channels, and Custom House expansion. In 2009 the company invested $25 million of operating expenses in these initiatives.", "The electronic channel, investments include WesternUnion.com, account to cash, mobile, and pre-paid cards. Despite incremental investments in electronic channels and PSD, C2C margins are expected to expand in 2010. Global business payment margins however are expected to decline. Additional Custom House expansion and acquisition related costs combined with the softness in US bill payments will result in lower margins.", "Intangible amortization from the Custom House acquisition will be approximately $13 million in 2010 an increase from the $4 million recorded in the final four months of 2009. Due to the increased amortization and investment spending, Custom house is expected to be slightly dilutive to EPS this year. We do not expect Custom House to be dilutive beyond 2010.", "The company\u2019s consolidated 2010 margin will also be affected by a full year of managing the retail money order portfolio. This should impact margins by approximately 40 basis points for the full year, although there is no impact to EPS. As a percentage of revenues we expect the combination of marketing and price reductions to be in a similar range as recent years. Marketing is expected to decrease slightly to approximately 4% of revenues. ", "We are gaining efficiencies and marketing through our global branding campaigns and our standardized pricing programs in the domestic business. Pricing is expected to increase to approximately 3% of revenue, primarily as a result of the full year impact of the US domestic re-pricing. Marketing and other investment spend which was weighted toward the back half of the year in 2009 is expected to have a more normal seasonal pattern in 2010.", "We project the combination of increased margins in the C2C business and declines in global business payments to result in a consolidated margin of approximately 26%. The decline from 2009 levels can be attributable to the incremental investment costs, Custom House intangible amortization, and the full year impact of the assumption of the retail money order portfolio. We also anticipate second half 2010 margins will be stronger than first half.", "We believe our business model is supportive of margin expansion when revenue growth accelerates and market improves. We anticipate a tax rate in 2010 of 24% to 25% and net other expense of approximately $160 million. In light of these factors, our outlook for GAAP EPS for 2010 is $1.29 to $1.34. We currently do not expect any impact from currency on EPS.", "As we move through the year, foreign exchange could impact our reported revenue, margins, and earnings. For each 5% change in the European currencies, the annual impact on revenue would be approximately $60 million. Due to our hedging programs the impact to profit would be considerably less at approximately $6 million.", "Turning to 2010 cash flows, capital expenditures are expected to be in our recent range of 2% to 3% of revenue. Two other items are projected to impact cash flows this year. Both items have been previously expensed and recorded as liabilities but will likely impact cash flow in 2010. First, we expect to pay the $71 million related to the Arizona and multi-state settlement this year. ", "Also, we play to make a refundable cash deposit with the IRS. This deposit relates to potential federal tax liabilities arising from our 2003 international restructuring, making the deposit limits further accrual of interest and the deposit is refundable if we prevail in our position. We are planning to deposit $250 million with the IRS in 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the total liabilities on our balance sheet for known tax exposures were approximately $500 million which includes potential tax liabilities related to the 2003 international restructuring and other items.", "On a GAAP basis including these items cash flow from operations is expected to be $800 to $900 million. Our business model has consistently generated cash flow in excess of earnings and we expect that to continue in the future. We plan to utilize these cash flows to invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders through both stock buyback and dividends.", "We increased our dividend significantly at the end of last year to $0.06 a quarter. In addition, we plan to continue to be active with stock buyback again in 2010 providing a balanced payback for our shareholders.", "Now I will turn the call back over to Christina for some final comments on our long term strategies.", "Christina Gold", "Although the environment is still challenging in 2010 we see strength in our core. Trends in the C2C business are improving and we believe our brand, network compliance and expertise and financial strength position us well for long term profitable growth. In 2009 we have evolved our strategies, our organization and our go to market initiatives. Our growth strategies can be characterized in three primary areas; the core C2C money transfer, electronic channels and business payments.", "In our core C2C we are aggressively pursuing opportunities in Europe with the new retail agent distribution available under the payment services directive. We are aiming to grow in these markets through strategic expansion of our network and targeted marketing. As a result of the PSD in Europe we expect to have an additional 10,000 retail agent locations operational by the end of 2010 and believe we will be able to significantly expand locations and revenues over the next several years. By 2011 we anticipate the added distribution in Europe will add one to two percentage points of revenue growth to our overall business.", "In Asia, where revenue and profitability are ramping up, we are also rapidly expanding our distribution network. Worldwide we expect to have over 450,000 agent locations by the end of the year. In the Americas we are targeting revenue growth in the domestic business by late 2010. We also plan to add more banks to our distribution network bringing new customers and the potential to provide account to cash offerings.", "Additionally, we see opportunity to increase our distribution into new classes of trade through the go cash in lain money transfer service which we will pilot later this year. Outside the US we are targeting our intra business in certain countries through focused marketing efforts. Excluding US domestic, intra is approximately 2% of our overall revenue and there are opportunities for us to grow this business in markets such as the UK and Indonesia.", "The second growth strategy focuses on development of electronic channels including WU.com, account to cash, pre-paid cards and mobile. Our strategy is to invest and expand our efforts now to be at the forefront of these channels as they evolve. We believe these efforts will give us access to new customer segments and provide more choice for existing consumers extending our life cycle with them. ", "We continue to grow Western Union.com led by the international markets where transaction growth exceeded 50% in the fourth quarter. We are focused on adding new countries, increasing awareness, expanding customer payment options and improving the customer experience.

These customers have higher incomes and are more fully banked then our traditional cash consumers, which expands our market opportunity. ", "Transactions from our account to cash service with banks increased over 60% in the quarter although off a small base. We currently have 12 banks globally that offer our account to cash service and we are working with both existing and new bank agents to more than double this number in 2010.", "Our pre-paid programs are targeted at providing new services to our existing under banked consumers. We tested pre-paid cards in 2009 with Western Union Gold and Moneywise Visa and MasterCard programs and are very pleased with the results. We are moving forward with a larger roll out of these cards as well as additional offerings and we plan to have over 750,000 enrolled cards in the US by the end of 2010. We will need to drive usage of these cards once enrolled but we are already seeing solid response rates.", "The US pre-paid market is large and growing, with industry projections estimating open loop principal volume at over $100 billion. Our cards offer a great value proposition to our consumers and good economics to us through reload and interchange revenue so we are very excited about the opportunity.", "Our mobile strategy is evolving. In 2009 our pilots targeted cross border transfers to mobile phones in Kenya and the Philippines. In the fourth quarter of last year we enabled 10,000 Western Union agent locations with the technology to provide cash to mobile service. In 2010 we are focused on continuing to enable our agent network with the point of sale capability for mobile as well as targeting new relationships and markets. ", "By the end of this year we plan to have 75,000 locations enabled representing our key global send locations. We are also targeting being connected to over 150 million mobile phones by the end of this year. Although there will not be an immediate financial impact from these connections, as mobile wallets become more prevalent we will be well established. Mobile revenue is still a long term proposition and is currently limited by consumer preference, regulatory restrictions, and technology challenges. ", "Although there are nearly five billion mobile phones in the world today the number of mobile wallets is only in the 10s of millions. Mobile wallet adoption is expected to increase rapidly with industry forecasts projecting around one billion accounts in the next five years.

We believe that these channels will become more important over time and our strategies and investments today will position us well as the leader in these areas as they evolve.", "Our third key growth area is business payments. The acquisition of Custom House has given us a strong platform for growth in a large market segment. We estimate the small to medium enterprise cross border payments global revenue opportunity is at least as great as C2C money transfer. Custom House has proven itself adept at serving the cross border foreign exchange payment needs of businesses of all types, in particular small and medium sized enterprises.", "We have begun increasing penetration in our existing seven countries with additional sales and product personnel and offices and plan to expand into new markets in 2010. Custom House has a strong track record of customer loyalty so investing up front to acquire new clients and expand to new territories will pay off with long term revenue streams.", "Canada, where Custom House is based, is our largest market with approximately $30 million of revenue. Given the size of Custom House Canadian business we believe increasing penetration in the US by itself is a huge opportunity in addition to expansion in other markets across the world. We expect growth to ramp up as we execute on our roll out plan. We believe we can grow business to business payments to a billion dollar business over time with solid margins once we complete integration and major expansion spending.", "As we focus on long term growth in our core C2C, electronic channels, and B2B businesses, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities.

The income gap between emerging and developed countries will still be substantial for the foreseeable future.

Maybe beyond 2010 but certainly for 2010 it looks like it may not happen. Is that an accurate characterization? Why are we in this spot?", "", "Christina Gold", "We feel very confident that we will continue to gain share in 2010. As we look at the projections from the World Bank obviously one of the issues has been a slowdown in the Middle East and the Gulf States. That actually occurred after Ramadan in December. Despite that we saw that we gained shares in that region as well. We feel very confident that our plans this year will allow us to continue to gain market share.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "You\u2019re actually saying that the World Bank information would be adjusted down and so you can continue to gain share?", "Christina Gold", "I think we look at it that way. Also we look at that, we look at the growth we\u2019re seeing in other markets and we\u2019re looking at the principal that we\u2019re moving around the world so we feel very confident that we will gain share again this year.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "The initial evidence on whether the US domestic pricing promotions that you had in the fourth quarter, have they helped volumes and by how much?", "Christina Gold", "We really saw an integrated plan as the team looked at repositioning the US. There was pricing, there was marketing, there was really a whole halo effect on this business. Recognizing that the pricing was only a band below $200 and that actually there was some price increases in bands over $200. As we came through the quarter you saw that our transactions came at 5% but we actually grew transactions to higher and higher rates of growth to a double digit position as we came out of the quarter.", "It\u2019s also important to note that it wasn\u2019t just let\u2019s say the $50 band or the $200 or the next day product, we saw a halo effect so that all of the different price categories even over $200 where we were not pricing we saw growth and improvement in the transaction rates. We\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to see revenue growth in the back half of 2010. It\u2019s very important for us because this is a big business and it\u2019s also a very profitable business to the company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I wanted to talk a little bit about the C2C business. It looks like constant currency revenue was -2% for the quarter and for the year and transaction growth was about 4.5% or close to 5%. When we go into 2010 do we immediately see improvement off those numbers in the first quarter or do we have to take a step function down due to the Gulf States?", "Scott Scheirman", "As we think about 2010 overall on the C2C business those trends will be stronger than 2009 both in transaction and revenue growth. Asia/Pacific there\u2019s still big opportunities there where we have 8% of our revenue but its 20% of the market opportunity. PSD as an example we\u2019re going to add 10,000 locations, the ramp up of that will be from a revenue standpoint the latter part of 2010. For example, with PSD we believe that\u2019s going to add 1% to 2% consolidated revenue growth in 2011. ", "We do believe 2010 will be a building year. Margins will be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Within the C2C business we expect to gain share and we expect to expand the margins in the C2C business in 2010.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "When you look at all the quarters is it almost all corridors increasing or accelerating except the Gulf States? What percentage of revenue does the Gulf States come out to be?", "Christina Gold", "I think what we\u2019re seeing in the business is an overall improvement across the world except the challenge of the Gulf and the Gulf really had the biggest difficulty right at the end of the year so we built that into our plans. We see an improving world out there. We do not give the percentage of the Gulf but maybe Hikmet can talk a little bit about how important Saudi Arabia is and some of those countries.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we see the challenging economic environment but we are very well positioned in the countries. We have really great brand awareness; we have great dedicated locations in Saudi Arabia and UAE and Qatar, Oman and Kuwait. I think the transactions will grow in quarter four. An employment decline did impact our transactions in Q4. We are well positioned if the economy comes back. If you look at our business we are in 200 countries and territories, we have thousands of corridors. The Gulf States is one of our regions from many regions.", "Bryan Keane \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The global business payments margins are going to be down looks like pretty significantly this year. Can you talk about, does that rebound in 2011? I might have missed this but tax rate guidance for 2010.", "Scott Scheirman", "Let me start with tax rate guidance, 24% to 25% on the tax rate for 2010. On global business payments broadly two things are impacting that business. First is the US bill payment business, we\u2019ve got challenges with the credit environment in the US. Much of our bill payment in the US skewed towards mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, those have been very challenging because of the macro environment in the US. That will put pressure on the margins.", "The second is Custom House in the business to business space. We see that as an enormous opportunity. In fact, historically we view it a game changer. We think that really could be. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in that business in 2010, which will impact the margins. We think longer term that\u2019s got the legs to be a billion dollar business. We know that the revenue market opportunity as big as the C2C revenue market opportunity. We\u2019ll continue to invest and grow. It\u2019s probably a little too early to talk about 2011 in specifics but with Custom House it\u2019ll be slightly dilutive in 2010 but we don\u2019t expect dilution beyond 2010 with Custom House.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Ironic that we\u2019re finally starting to see some encouraging signs in C2C growth but now it appears that B2B and C2B is struggling at this point. The operating margin guidance is also the thing that I think is really throwing people this morning and frustrating them, at least the shareholders. Maybe if we could take a step back and reposition or clarify some things. ", "Can you delineate the challenges there between transition costs and ongoing operating headwinds and talk about the factors that are putting pressure on margins in 2010? I think most people out there were not expecting a 26 handle on margins. Talk about what\u2019s going on in margins and why we should at all believe that they could go up in 2011 and 2012.", "Scott Scheirman", "Let me first broadly start with the consolidated margin of 26% and what is putting some pressure on that. First I\u2019d say the C2C business which is 85% of our revenues we expect those margins to expand in 2010 and we believe that business model clearly is set to grow margins as revenue reaccelerates and the market improves. C2C margins will expand in 2010.", "On a consolidated basis what\u2019s putting pressure on the margins I\u2019d really put it in three buckets. First it\u2019s the retail money order portfolio. We took that over from First Data on October 1st. In the fourth quarter that impacted our margins by about 50 basis points. We\u2019ll have that for three quarters in 2010 so that\u2019ll be approximately a 40 basis point impact on margins.", "Second I would point Custom House, we\u2019ve got $13 million of intangible amortization related to the acquisition. The third area is investments we\u2019re making in the business. We invested about $25 million in 2009; we\u2019ll invest about $50 million. We think it\u2019s really important that we make those investments. We see really good opportunities in the B2B space, we see good opportunities in electronic. Electronic channel today is only 2% of our revenues and it has the opportunity to be much bigger than that. We\u2019d like to make those investments; we think that\u2019s prudent to do.", "We do believe, as the market improves, as revenue reaccelerates, we\u2019ve got a business model that can drive margin expansion on a go forward basis.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "This is a little bit different than I think the way the press release reads and the way the stock is reacting pre-market because the margin pressure in 2010 the initial view of 26% looks really bad and will draw a lot of pressure on this management team in terms what are you guys doing in terms of executing. If you\u2019re telling me that the pressure is coming from a portfolio that\u2019s coming in from the outside, the Custom House intangibles and investments which are another 50 basis points, overall the business looks more stable in 2010 than it did before, with the potential for revenue growth to be better given the current trends we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter.", "Christina Gold", "You\u2019re right. The C2C we expect margin expansion in 2010 in the core business.", "Adam Frisch \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "The business itself looks a lot more stable than the press release is suggesting. I just want you to know the perception in terms of what\u2019s going on out there and the explanation you just gave are two very different things.", "On the increased investment in payments initiatives, we think it\u2019s necessary; we\u2019d love to see that the increases happening there. Why only $50 million? The up tick is $25 million, where is that money being spent and why isn\u2019t it a bigger number?", "Christina Gold", "We look at it in terms of what we think is a realistic target and where we really want to focus. If we look at our dot com expansion we\u2019re really going after new markets and opening that up. I think we feel we have adequate funds to do what we need. We also look at some of the funds that we already have within our marketing and investment budgets and we reallocated it as well. We feel very good about what we\u2019re investing. ", "As you look at PSD because we were looking to see really strong revenue coming out of that later in the year and into 2011. I think we are in good shape there. The pre-paid is also going to accelerate as we go through the year. We will look at is as well dependent upon what happens in the marketplace if we see initiatives that we really start to ramp up very quickly we would reconsider putting more funds behind it if we see the return coming fast enough.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "In past calls we heard a lot about your various successes in renegotiating agent commissions lower and the benefits of that had on the margin. Could you quantify what the benefits of those initiatives were in 2009 and maybe where you are in the progress? It wasn\u2019t a part of your prepared remarks so I wonder how much more do you have to do there, can you do there, and how will that help stem the tide of some of these other margin pressures in 2010?", "Christina Gold", "I think the important thing is this is an ongoing process; it\u2019s not a one year type of program. As we renegotiate contracts we really work at getting a better financial result in terms of how we renegotiate those contracts. Also a lot of new contracts that come to us we start at a different point in terms of commissions.", "Hikmet Ersek", "We sign agreements with better conditions with lower commission rates, long term agreements which benefit, also using new customers using that agent benefits our cost structure. Also with PSD, we are now PSD licensed in Europe. With the PSD license we are kind of the super agent ourselves and we have direct access to the locations with better commission rates, that\u2019s helps also to drive our cost structure.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On Custom House, you mentioned what the intended amortization was in 2009 was it $4 million.", "Scott Scheirman", "$4 million, you\u2019re right.", "Christopher Mammone \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "You had that, what would you characterize as other acquisition related costs? If you exclude all that was Custom House actually profitable after the time that you brought it on board?", "Scott Scheirman", "Within Custom House we had clearly deal costs to pay bankers and attorneys. We\u2019re embarking on integration costs as we move forward. As we think about 2010 it will be slightly dilutive but as we leave 2010 we don\u2019t expect it to have any impact or not be dilutive to our earnings in 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "On the pricing pressure associated with the US marketing changes you made, can you quantify how much of that you expect to play into; I think you said three points of pressure from pricing during 2010?", "Scott Scheirman", "On the pricing for 2010 we\u2019re running at that 3% within that historical 1% to 3%. The DMT pricing probably moved us from a 2% range to a 3% range in 2010 because of the repositioning but well within our historical average and what we think makes a good investment in the business.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "To deconstruct the guidance you have for revenue, you\u2019re calling for a range that I think is a little below some of the expectations. Just wondering how much conservatism is built into that. If we think about $75 million is probably the year over year comp that you\u2019re going to have from Custom House maybe that\u2019s a percent and a half of growth. ", "Excluding that, you have pricing pressure, you pointed to about three points. Given where transaction trends are, seems to be somewhat favorable in most of your corridors this quarter versus the prior quarter. Can you talk about what\u2019s going to drive the, what are the other components of the guidance for revenue besides those two?", "Christina Gold", "As we look around the world what we do as we develop that guidance we do a bottoms up from all of our countries and our 15,000 corridors so we do a deep dive to have a good understanding of where the puts and takes are on the forecast. I think we also see some softness coming from the US to Mexico business that is not rebounding. As we talked about today we do see improvements in Europe and other parts of the world. There are two areas where we\u2019re focused, one is the Gulf States and the other is the Mexico piece. Those are our two biggest challenges.", "Obviously as we develop with the PSD and some of our electronic channels we\u2019ll see some pick up in revenue and we\u2019ll also see that pick up later in the year on the domestic side. We try to be as, I would not say conservative, but as balanced as possible because if we remember last year when we talked about revenue we always cautioned that the Gulf was always something that we were concerned about. It didn\u2019t materialize until later in the year but it did happen. I think we feel that we\u2019ve been very realistic in terms of how we put this together and a lot will depend, particularly let\u2019s say in our US business in terms of the unemployment rates and how that goes over the next six to 12 months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "To follow up on the assumptions for growth, the three percentage points of pressure from pricing looks like, based on the numbers we have, we have about 1.5% of benefit from acquisitions. Can you fill the gap then in terms of what the underlying transaction volume assumption is I might have missed that?", "Scott Scheirman", "For the C2C business both from a transaction standpoint and a revenue standpoint using 2009 as a benchmark we believe the C2C transactions in revenue will be north of that number for 2010. As you think about your guidance or your outlook as you\u2019re pulling your model together. We\u2019re seeing improvements in the US outbound business, we saw some strength in the fourth quarter, and we saw Western Europe pull through, Russia, the UK, and Germany. ", "Areas where we\u2019re probably going to see some headwinds in 2010 would be the domestic money transfer repositioning, it\u2019s the right investment to make but we won\u2019t see positive revenue growth until the fourth quarter there as we exit the year. The other area is probably just some headwinds in the US C2B business that\u2019ll provide some headwinds. Overall for C2C we expect to expand the margins and grow transactions and revenue north of where we grew them in 2009.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Backing up a little bit, having gone through this cycle and obviously never having seen one quite like this for you guys. Is the sense now that as you look at 2010 is this model just going to end up being more of a lagging model, a lag recovery relative to what we\u2019re seeing on the broader macro trends? Can you address that because it feels to me at least what seems to be changing on the margin for me is a sense that this is not a leading recovery story but more of a lagging recovery? Is there some way to think about that or help us think about how that dynamic plays out in your model in 2010.", "Christina Gold", "It\u2019s very much focused also in terms of what regions of the world are having a difficulty. If we look at Europe we see the rebound and its come pretty quickly. We look at Russia, its coming back, even Spain is returning. We are leading there. Where we see the lag is more in the US and also in the Gulf, which was the question we had before. In the US we went in earlier and we seem to be having a longer timeframe to come out, particularly to Mexico. That\u2019s really coming back to the whole issue to unemployment. We see the same issue in the Gulf. ", "In other parts of the world we see very nice rebounds, we feel confident in our ability to drive our business there its just balancing the portfolio this year in terms of as different markets are in different stages of recovery and that\u2019s been a bit of a challenge in why we have the guidance that we have in terms of our revenue numbers.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "To put some perspective on that, the mix of agents or the corridors, if you take US, Middle East and Mexico, what percentage of your agent base is that versus the other parts of the world and relative to revenue as well?", "Christina Gold", "We don\u2019t really give that number. As you know, Mexico is about 5% to 6% of our revenue so that you can take it that\u2019s a big chunk of that there. No other market is quite that large. Outside of the US that\u2019s one of our biggest markets.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "When you look at the new channels obviously you guys are doing a lot in the mobile and the bank channels and everything that\u2019s out there. Give us a sense on what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of principals per transaction because it seems like that\u2019s another area where the volume, at least the principal leverage that you\u2019re seeing is probably lower than expected. Do you have any sense on how the new channels are comparing to what would be your traditional business in terms of the overall principal per transaction?", "Christina Gold", "It depends on the customers because some of our newer customers we see large principals but certain channels you would see less principal only because there\u2019s more controls as it relates to managing compliance and also fraud when you\u2019re dealing on the electronics side. On the mobile side we definitely see a smaller level of principal that\u2019s just been what we\u2019ve seen in the traditional of it so far. We see a lot of opportunity in the account to cash, as we develop that with the different banks because they know their customer that we can start expending the principal bands in that particular category.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Did you provide a target for principal growth expected in 2010 or even principal per transaction?", "Scott Scheirman", "We did not. Our overall thinking just broadly as we think that that could abate somewhat from what we\u2019ve seen in 2009 but didn\u2019t give any specifics on that.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Still a premium to whatever the World Bank ends up coming out with?", "Scott Scheirman", "We believe we\u2019re going to gain market share in 2010.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "The investment spending, glad to hear you\u2019re picking that up. You gave us some targets foreseen on some of the metrics there; I tried to write some of that down. How should we measure the success in terms of revenue? It sounds like electronic channel is about 2% now, where should we expect that for 2010 and similarly for Custom House, what should we expect there? What should we be watching for in 2010?", "Christina Gold", "If you look at the electronic channels most of them are growing at double digit rates in the electronic channels, Custom House we said we\u2019re looking at double digit growth. We\u2019re looking at very strong growth rates and they become more meaningful to our business. We will report on those numbers that I talked about today, we\u2019ll report on them every quarter so you can track. ", "Also later this year, we want to have an investor conference with all of you so we can also give you more information in terms of how some of these numbers all connect. We\u2019ll talk a little bit about different metrics as we look at electronic and where we really want to take the business over time so that we expand our portfolio and our customer base.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "The Gulf Coast, it did sounds like it\u2019s slowed commensurate with some of the Dubai news. Just to be clear, are you looking for transactions to still be positive in 2010? How did they look in November, December and even January if you could share that just to give us an idea?", "Christina Gold", "Overall for the Gulf we\u2019re in really good shape in terms of our locations and our agents. We anticipate growth in 2010 but not at the double digit rate that we were seeing in 2009. Where we did see the slowdown it was really at the very end of the quarter after Ramadan we didn\u2019t see the up tick come back and that\u2019s really been the challenge. We factored that into our forecast for the year.", "Tien-Tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan", "Still positive. First Data money order portfolio you gave the margin dilution that\u2019s consistent with what you said in the past. What\u2019s the positive impact on the tax rate in the fourth quarter and maybe for 2010? Can we tie those two together, lower margins but also lower tax rate?", "Scott Scheirman", "There is definitely some impact because of the interest income on the munis as tax exempt so it factors both into the 24% to 25% range that we have for a tax rate outlook for 2010. Then also it was one of the factors why the tax rate came down in 2009. Although for 2009 it was also the tax planning strategy we put in place in 2008 and then more of our profits are being generated internationally which are taxed at a lower rate. It\u2019s a combination of all those things that helped drive the tax rate down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Trying to drill down on Custom House, it seems like its coming up a little bit short relative to your expectations. I thought it was supposed to be accretive and generate around 20% margins. Maybe you can drill down a bit.", "Christina Gold", "What we\u2019re really looking at is we see the opportunity for us as being similar to the C2C business. We have the capabilities and we have the team to expand it so as we speak I think they\u2019re hiring an awful lot of people on the East coast and the West coast just in the United States. The US is certainly under penetrated and if you look at Canada being $30 million it\u2019s usually 10:1 so you can imagine how big the US should be for us in that business. We\u2019re rapidly going after that right now. We are on our business case but actually putting more investment in early on because we want to make sure that we grow to that billion dollar revenue stream.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Can you give us a sense on what your target for revenue in 2010 is?", "Christina Gold", "It\u2019ll be double digit growth and a lot is going to be dependant also on new customer acquisition because it\u2019s really the expansion that we have to see and their ability. We saw in fourth quarter we did see their average principal on some of their customers had slowed a bit but their customer acquisition rate is well up in the 30% rate so that\u2019s wonderful and they have a real skill set at doing that.", "Jim Kissane \u2013 Bank of America", "Given the impact on transactions in the US will you consider more aggressive pricing actions outside the US?", "Christina Gold", "No we would not. I think we would just consider, the US has been an issue for a long period of time. That domestic business is a very big business and it was really the problem of having every city had a different price; we couldn\u2019t get a uniform marketing position. It\u2019s still a very profitable business. The profit of that business is above the Western Union average so it\u2019s important to us. ", "As you look at other parts of the world, when we go into the intra business its only 2% of our revenue or less than 2%. The impact on our overall company to move intra to different price points you just wouldn\u2019t see that, we wouldn\u2019t be doing that. We don\u2019t have the same issue. This is a long established business that really needed a re-look and a re-think and we\u2019re very delighted to see all the levels of our business in the US starting to move in the domestic side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "If I can go back to the guidance again and look at your revenue growth guidance, the margin was in line for me. The mid-point of that range looks to essentially be flat. If we take out double digit growth in the B2B that implies for the C2C business you\u2019re looking down a couple a percent at the mid-point. Is that correct? If it is, with 300 basis points of pricing compression, again it comes down to the issue that it looks like your implicit volume growth numbers are up about 1% and don\u2019t include market share gains against the World Bank.", "Christina Gold", "I think that we see growth and growth potential. I think the other thing, as you look at the revenue growth; one thing you have to remember is the domestic pricing is having an impact on our growth rate. It\u2019s probably at about 100 basis points on the year so that\u2019s there too. It doesn\u2019t really show but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to us, we don\u2019t see the growth from that business until the back end of the year.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "That\u2019s included in the 300 basis points price compression.", "Christina Gold", "It\u2019s also included in your revenue growth rate. You\u2019re working on both ends.", "Robert Dodd \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "On the currency issue that you gave us some color in terms of the 5% Euro move and some revenue. That, given we\u2019ve got a little bit of a tailwind so far at least would tend to say that\u2019s a driver for margin compression in 2010 as well. Is that correct? If so, how much of your margin compression is a result of the current status of the FX rates?", "Scott Scheirman", "You\u2019re right. That does pose a headwind on the margin. In our outlook we believe constant currency revenue growth will be 1% lower so on a GAAP basis we\u2019re picking up about roughly $50 million, 1% on a $5 billion business so about $50 million of revenue. Our EPS outlook had no impact from currency. In simple terms, we\u2019re picking up $50 million of revenue, no bottom line impact so that really does put some negative pressure on the margin because of that. Probably if you do the math its probably 20 or 30 basis points. ", "Mike Salop", "We\u2019ve run a little long but we want to thank everyone for joining the call.

Please proceed, sir.", "Mike Salop", "Thank you, Jerry and good morning everyone. On today\u2019s call we will have comments from Christina Gold, Western Union\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Hikmet Ersek, our Chief Operating Officer, and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

I\u2019m sure many of you have read this morning that I announced my intention to retire as President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Union on September 1. After leading the company for over eight years, I feel the timing is right. The Western Union brand and network are strong, our strategies are in place and we have a sound succession plan.", "I have been very fortunate to have worked of exceptional employees, agents and business partners over the years and one those exceptions people is Hikmet Ersek. Hikmet has been with Western Union for over ten years, most recently as Chief Operating Officer after previously leading our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions. Hikmet will assume the President and CEO role and I\u2019m very confident he\u2019s the right person to lead Western Union forward.", "Now, our business is off to a good start in 2010 as we execute on our strategies of driving profitable growth in our core C2C money transfer developing electronic channels and expanding business payments. ", "Globally our core cash money transfer business is gaining momentum. Although we still face challenging employment levels in key send regions, we are experiencing improving trends in many markets and believe we are continuing to gain market share. Our total international business have been steady with transaction gains in US outbound offsetting the expected less favorable trends in the Gulf state.", "Transactions in our C2C business grew at a health 8% rate which was 300 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 and our strongest increase in the last five quarters. The improvement was primarily driven by the Americas region while we continue to benefit from last year\u2019s repositioning of the US domestic business. Our plan to pull US consumers to our brand remains on track and domestic transactions ramped up to 18% growth in the quarter.", "In addition to US domestic, the Americas benefited from improved trends in both US outbound and Mexico. We also made advances on our strategic initiatives, we are signing new retail agents in activating locations in Europe as we move towards our target of an incremental 10,000 retail agent activations by year-end. We have been placing particular emphasis on signing smaller independent shops which are located in areas where large immigrant populations work and live.", "One retail signing we just completed is the Martin McColl convenience store chain in the UK, which will provide an additional 700 agent locations. In the US, our banking strategy took another step forward as we completed the rollout of our Money Transfer service at more than 1300 Fifth Third bank locations. Banks now represent 13% of our total US and Canada network locations.", "Within our electronic channels, westerunion.com had a record transaction month in March with the international portion posting over 60% growth in the quarter, we are moving forward with our country expansion plans for later in the year and adding new product offerings to the US site such as overnight home delivery and gift cards. We are also enhancing non-transaction services as we have seen a large number of visitors using westernunion.com for activities such as finding agent locations, evaluating projects or checking on the status of their transaction.", "Our account to cash service experienced over 65% transaction growth in the quarter and we just initiated an online service with Banco do Brasil, the country\u2019s largest financial institution.", "We\u2019re also implementing an innovative service with Absa one of the largest financial service groups in South Africa and a subsidiary of Barclays. Absa customers will soon to able to initiate money transfers both to and from their accounts utilizing the bank\u2019s online site or its mobile banking platform.", "In total, we now have 15 banks that have agreed to offer account to cash service with others in the pipeline. In prepaid at the end of the quarter, we had over 365,000 cards in force in the United States, most with the result of direct marketing efforts to Western Union\u2019s current consumer base. At the end of March, we began retail distribution of our prepaid cards and we now have over 4500 retail locations carrying the cards.", "We continue to be encouraged by the consumer response to our fee-friendly cards and believe prepaid gives us an opportunity to provide additional financial solutions for our consumers, while participating in the large and growing markets. Enrollments continue to ramp up and we\u2019re on target to have over 750,000 cards in force by the end of the year.", "In mobile, we have over 19,000 agent locations in ten countries enable to provide Cash to Mobile service as we progress towards our goal of 75,000 by year end. We are currently focused on activating the most operational mobile corridors, so the majority of today\u2019s connections target the Philippines and Kenya. The activation of mobile service capabilities is part of our program to upgrade to web based point-of-sale technology, which will speed up all transactions and simplify our business processes.", "We\u2019re also positioning ourselves to participate in other mobile models that are emerging. These models are based on mobile banking platforms rather than mobile [wallets] and are being driven by regulatory requirements in some countries. The agreement with Absa in South Africa is one example. Western Union\u2019s brand and global distribution network are key compliments for banks that wish to offer this service to their mobile banking customers.", "Electronic channels in total represents 2% of company revenue and we continue to expect strong growth from these channels as we further rollout services and increase our capabilities. At Custom House expansion activities are progressing nicely. In the quarter, we opened new sales offices in Atlanta and New Jersey and are in the process of obtaining licenses to provide additional services in certain European countries. The business results are on plan, the new customer acquisition strategies are being implemented and we\u2019re well into the process of strengthening Custom House capacity for global expansion.", "Western Union\u2019s financial position remain strong. In the quarter, we deployed our cash to shareholders by repurchasing $200 million of stock and paying $41 million in quarterly dividends and we also extended the maturity of $300 million of our debt. Overall we are encouraged by the first three months of the year and the improvements we are seeing in the marketplace. We feel very comfortable with our full-year financial outlook as well as our ability to continue to gain market share.", "At this time, I would like to welcome Hikmet and turn the call over to him for a further review of the quarter.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you Christina and good morning everyone. Before I review the results I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m very thankful to Christina and to our Board of Directors for their confidence and trust and I\u2019m very much looking forward to taking on challenge of leading Western Union.", "I believe the long-term opportunities for the company are terrific and we will work had to drive the strategies to achieve them. This morning though, let's return to the review of the first quarter performance. Given the environment entering the year we are pleased with our consumer-to-consumer business in the first quarter. C2C revenue increased 3% or about flat on a constant currency basis.", "Our 8% transaction growth was aided by the double-digit increase in the US domestic money transfer business, but we also saw better trends in the US outbound and Mexico and continued strength in Europe and Asia.", "Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region delivered revenue growth of 5% on the transaction increase of 6% in the quarter. The transactions performance was slightly below the 8% level in the fourth quarter primarily due to relatively flat results in the Gulf states.", "Most markets in Europe delivered stable or slightly improved transaction trends relative to the fourth quarter. Russia continued to show improvement delivering solid growth in the period.", "EMEA reported growth of 7% on transactions, growth of 6% in the quarter was impacted by the moderation in remittances from the Gulf states. However we continue to make good progress in the market. The Reserve Bank of India recently released official remittance data for all of 2009, which indicated Western Union delivered significant out performance. Among the new signings in the quarter, in the EMEASA region, where the United Bank for Africa and Nigeria and Banco Africano de Investimentos in Angola.", "We saw our most dramatic improvement in the quarter in the Americas region, transactions which were flat in the fourth quarter increased 8% in the first three months of 2010. Revenue in the region declined 3% compared to a 7% decrease in the fourth quarter of 2009. The US domestic repositioning continues to deliver strong results. We are driving new consumers to our brands and increasing usage resulting in the 18% transaction increase in the quarter for domestic money transfer.", "The $50 for $5 transfers were very successful and our improvement was broad based. As we record the better transaction trends across all our domestic principle events. Domestic revenues declined 13% for the period and improvement from the 20% decrease, we experienced last quarter.", "We continue to expect revenue growth to turn positive later this year. Domestic revenue transfers also remains a very profitable business for us with operating margins of over 30%. The new pricing and marketing is just one part of the integration in the US. We also acquired new customers through the banking channel and westernunion.com and provide a new product offering such as prepaid cards and GoCash and including money transfer solutions.", "Our integrated US (inaudible) is in the early stages of implementation, but the initial results are very encouraging. The US outbound business also experienced improved transactions growth in the quarter as we saw favorable trends across all of our major corridors.", "Mexico business trends improved nicely from the recent quarters. Transactions declined 3% while revenues were down 7%. Each month in the quarter performed better than the prior one and Mexico recorded a positive transaction growth in the month of March. In addition to the continued state of performance of our strategic and regional accounts also our small independent agents delivered much better results than the recent quarters.", "In other key agent signing in the Americas region was the Giant Eagle supermarket chain in the US which was a competitive takeaway. In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue increased 14% in the quarter on a transaction growth of 15%. China continued its positive trends with 21% growth in the revenue and 8% in transactions.", "We also recently added more banks to our network in China raising our total to eight banks. The Philippines once again delivered strong transaction growth in the quarter. And we are focused on supplementing our retail network in the country with additional banking distribution. Global business payment segment performed in line with expectations in the quarter with reported revenue growth of 4%. Excluding customers, revenue declined 10% due to challenges in the US bill pay.", "However, international Pago Facil continued to perform well. We are working hard to improve the US bill payment business. Our goals are focused on diversifying our product offerings, aggressively pursue new customers and billers in the market place and increase its efficiencies in our cost structure.", "In B2B payments customers reported revenue of $26 million in the quarter and increased from $23 million in the fourth quarter last year. The growth was driven by stronger business in Canada and the US. As we move through the year, we expect to see further benefits from our investment and new customer acquisition. We are on track with laying the groundwork to expand the B2B business over to several next years and remain excited about the opportunity.", "Now, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Scott to review the financial results for the quarter. Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. Consolidated revenue increased 3% including 2 percentage points of favorable currency translations. Sequentially, constant currency revenue growth rates improved 200 basis points and margins improved 140 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. The 8% transaction growth in C2C drove 3% revenue growth in the segment or flat constant currency.", "In global business payments, the strong Custom House business offset the expected decline US bill payment resulting in 4% on a growth. Total Western Union transaction fee represented 78% of company revenue and grew 1% in the quarter. Foreign exchange revenue represented 19% of total company revenue and increased 16% from the prior year benefiting from the acquisition of Custom House.", "We are pleased with two consecutive quarters of accelerating transaction growth in C2C up from the recent lows of 3% in the second and third quarters of 2009. Revenue in the international C2C business grew 6% in the quarter or 3% constant currency on transaction growth of 8%. Performance was driven by continued strength in Europe and Asia-Pacific and improving trends in US outbound business partially offset by the relatively flat transaction growth in the Gulf states.", "The company\u2019s C2C crossborder principal volume increased 7% in the quarter or 4% constant currency. C2C principles per transaction was flat or decreased 3% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago. The trend improved relative to the fourth quarter when constant currency C2C principal per transaction declined 6%. We view the moderation in the principal per transaction declines as one indicator of increased confidence by consumers in their economic outlook.", "The spread between C2C transactions and revenue in the quarter was 5 percentage points and included a three point benefit from currency. The factors affecting the eight point currency adjustment spread include a strong growth in the low principal band, domestic money transfer, pricing and mix.", "In the first quarter, domestic money transfer was responsible for three points of transaction to revenue spread. This represented a combination of both pricing and mix as we saw large transaction increases in the low principal bands. Excluding currency and the impact from domestic money transfer, the other factors impacting the transaction revenue spread were generally consistent with prior quarters.", "In our full-year outlook, we expect pricing actions including domestic to total approximately 3% of consolidated revenue. We anticipate full-year average pricing actions will be lower than the first quarter 2010 partially as a result of lapping the domestic price changes later this year.", "The current period also included some impact from zero fee or reduced fee transfers to Haiti and Chile that we implemented to support the people affected by the earthquakes. Consistent with our expectations, consolidated operating margin of 26% decreased relative to the same period last year, but improved sequentially from the fourth quarter.", "As you may recall, we had a strong margin of 28% in the first quarter of 2009 in part due to delayed investment and expense spending given the uncertain 2009 economic environment. Compared to the first quarter 2009, margins were impacted by incremental investments related to technology, PSD, electronic channels and Custom House expansion initiatives.", "During first quarter 2010, we made a number of key strategic investments. For example, we invested about $5 million in prepaid primarily to drive enrollments in our card programs. Prepaid is estimated to be a $100 billion market opportunity in the US and our investments are helping us establish a solid position in the space. We continue to invest in B2B payments, including opening new sales offices, hiring more sales and product personnel, improving technology and online capabilities and strengthening the compliance infrastructure.", "We believe that B2B revenue market opportunity is at least as big as a crossborder C2C revenue markets and we are investing now to drive growth in future years. In addition to our investments also impacting first quarter margins with the assumptions of the retail money order portfolio, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, a weaker US dollar and volume declines in the US bill payment business.", "The impact of the retail money order portfolio assumption was 40 basis points and incremental intangible amortization was approximately 40 basis points. ", "Marketing expense was 4% of revenue in line with our full-year outlook. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.30 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2009. We expect our operating margins in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, as we retire volumes and start to see benefits from several of our growth investments.", "We will also continue to mange costs carefully, work to improve efficiency and selectively reduce agent commissions. C2C segment operating margin was 27%, down a 120 basis points year-over-year and sequentially up a 170 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to first quarter 2009, C2C margins were impacted by incremental technology and other investments and a weak dollar compared to a year ago. For the full year, we continue to expect 2010 C2C margins to be higher than last year. Global business payments operating margin of 21% included the Custom House intangible amortization expense and investment spending for future growth. ", "Excluding Custom House segment margin of 26% was down from 29% last year, but consistent with the fourth quarter. Reduced volumes in the US bill payment business were responsible for the decline from last year\u2019s first quarter. The Custom House base business is healthy, but overall it\u2019s contributions to earnings is expected to be slightly dilutive due to the investment spend and intangible amortization. We do not anticipate dilution from Custom House beyond 2010.", "Turing to the balance sheet and cash flow. our financial position remains strong enabling a significant return of capital to shareholders. As of March 31st, the company had total debt of $3 billion in cash of $1.5 billion, of which approximately $700 million is outside the US. During the quarter we repurchased 12.4 million shares at an average price of $16.17 for a total of $200 million and paid $41 million in quarterly dividends.", "At quarter end, we had $800 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization and we plan to remain active during the year. Cash flow from operations were $74 million, which included the impact of the $250 million refundable cash deposit that we made with the IRS in the quarter. As we announced in the fourth quarter earnings release, the deposit relates to potential tax liabilities including those arising from the company\u2019s 2003 international restructuring.", "The deposit limits further accrue of interest on such potential tax liabilities, which have been previously reported in our financial statements. Capital expenditures totaled $15 million and we continue to expect them to range between 2% to 3% of revenues for the full year. In March, we completed a debt exchange retiring $304 million or 5.4% notes during 2011 and issuing $325 million or 5.25% notes due in 2020. ", "This leaves our nearest date of maturity at approximately $700 million during November of 2011. Turning to our outlook for the year, we are off to a good start in 2010, but it\u2019s still early. We affirm our full-year GAAP revenue and EPS outlook provided in February, this includes GAAP revenue in a range of minus one to plus 2% and GAAP EPS in a range of $1.29 to $1.34. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect GAAP and constant currency revenue to be similar.", "GAAP and constant currency EPS are also expected to be similar. We plan to continue our strong excess cash through reinvestment in the business, selective strategic acquisitions available and returning cash to shareholders in the form of stock buyback and quarterly dividends. Although, we utilized almost $500 million in the first quarter on share repurchases, dividends and the tax deposit. We still have over $1.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet and expect stronger cash flow generation in the second half of the year. ", "That concludes our prepared comments on the quarter. Jerry, we are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang  with JP Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "I want to first talk about the US outbound and Mexico I think that was the area that I was most obviously surprised by, can you talk about how much of that was maybe an improvement is some of the cyclical factors or if it really more just share gains. Maybe you can just speak in to that because Mexico piece look like they outperformed the speck of the Mexico data and the US outbound is not like they are getting better?", "Christina Gold", "I think what we\u2019ve seen in the US business to begin with is just the whole repositioning of the domestic money transfer business, has that halo effect on the whole market and so it\u2019s pushing all of the different sectors, not only domestic but US outbound and US to Mexico, but also in the Mexico portion of the business as you remember last year we were shutting down some the weaker locations because of credit issues. But the team worked very aggressively over the last few months to find new sources and new locations that didn't have these problems and so we\u2019re kind of lapping that. ", "But we\u2019re also seeing much more productivity coming out of those locations. So we feel very good about what we\u2019re seeing in our Mexico business, as well on the US outbound again it is not as tied to what we've seen in terms of the issues in unemployment and construction in the United States. So again the US outbound across the globe, we\u2019re seeing very nice growth across those segments.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "Any material or notable change in some of the cyclical factors domestically as we move month to month to the quarter?", "Christina Gold", "Obviously you have the issue of what we did in the fall, but I think what we saw month to month, we continue to gain strength and momentum in the domestic money transfer. So we\u2019re very pleased and feel, we make the right move at the right time to drive that business.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "The prepaid piece, it looks like the (inaudible) of nicely. Can you give us some detail around loads and activity or revenue anything else that you can share there just to give us a sense of how active those users are?", "Christina Gold", "I think we're starting to see some nice uptick in terms of activations of cards, but I think it's a little early days yet, because a lot of the cards came on late in last year. If you remember we finished last year at 150,000, now we\u2019re at 365,000. So that\u2019s one of the things that Stewart and his team is really working on now to find out what are the different methods to drive activation, the size of the loads and then the new thing that we've done as of March is really put it on the retail sort of counter.", "So that's a really going after different customers, we\u2019ll have more information as we see progress here. But we\u2019re very, very happy with what we\u2019re seeing and as you saw from Scott\u2019s remark we are investing to grow this business, because we think it's a huge opportunity for the company.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan", "You said $200 million on buyback, is that representative of what we might see for the rest of the year in terms of buyback?", "Scott Scheirman", "We haven't provided any specific outlook on that. We think $200 million is a good start, we will carefully manage our cash and our cash flows to investing the business, acquire companies and return cash to shareholders. And with that, we will be active as we move through the year with the stock buyback, but no specific outlook there in particular.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust", "Just for starters is a follow up on the prepaid business which is obviously getting a lot of attention here in the US as an industry at a standalone basis, you mentioned you spent about $5 million in the first quarter investing in that business, how does that compare to the investments you made last year and is that a pretty good quarterly runrate as far as what we should expect as 2010 continues to unfold here?", "Scott Scheirman", "If I go back to some remarks made about 90 days ago in our fourth quarter earnings call that we will spend about $50 million on strategic investments and that\u2019s up about $25 million from 2009. That $50 million will be if you will ratably spend for the most parts throughout 2010, maybe a little bit more heavily weighted in the first half of the year. Those investments will clearly be around our strategic priorities, prepaid as we're talking about right now, but also in the B2B, Custom House area, but also in our electronic channels as it relates to westernunion.com, mobile and account to cash. So we will continue to invest and we see both in the B2B space and prepaid just some very nice large market opportunities there and balanced with that opportunities to continue to grow our C2C business and gain share in that area too.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust", "It sounds like you are starting to highlight some of these new growth drivers, the account to cash and some of the international electronic transaction part of the business. I know one of the challenges in westernunion.com in the US historically has been regulatory, can you just comment on the regulatory environment and whether you feel like you have kind of solved that equation as you sound like you are reemphasizing some of these electronic money transfer channels? Is it kind of consistent, do you feel like you maybe made some progress internally as far as regulatory compliance is concerned that gives you more confidence or how shall we think about the challenges, potentially the growth versus the opportunities which seems big?", "Christina Gold", "We really see it as a huge opportunity for us and it really was not so much in the United States, the regulatory issue as opposed to an issue of fraud. And so what happened to us a couple of years ago with some of the credit card problems that they had, they was a large high level of fraud in the business. So we had to do a lot of things to really control how much we would allow people\u2019s credit cards to be accepted through the online transaction and that made it a very clunky unpleasant transaction for customers.", "So we have invested now heavily this year and we will complete all of the work I think by June this year so that when customers go online in US, it will be a very seamless transaction. So we feel very confident that we can continue to grow this business very aggressively and we will see tremendous growth there, so it really wasn\u2019t a regulatory issue, it was more protecting the company from fraud.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust", "It sounds like you have solved some of those challenges?", "Christina Gold", "Yes.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "First of all, on the transaction side with India and China specifically, I guess India slowed a little bit and you guys talked about some of the contagions from the Gulf states and China I think was flat versus last quarter. How do you guys think about the normalized transaction growth for those two countries over the medium to long term, assuming a more normal global macroenvironment?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we are progressing in both countries. In China we had a revenue growth of 21% and a transaction growth of 8%. Also in India we are having positive transaction growth. Recently the Reserve Bank of India released their numbers, remittance numbers for 2009, it shows really that we outperformed that Reserve Banks numbers. So we are doing pretty well here.", "It\u2019s gets a little bit from the Gulf states, Gulf outbound to South Asia to India, we had some a slowdown here, but even India, we are going globally (inaudible) everywhere and our presence being globally everywhere helps to drive the transactions. Also in China, our strategies are working in China. We had for years two big banks and they are still very valuable agents, like the Post bank and Agricultural Bank of China. But now we had also regional banks and we are having eight banks. So we\u2019re really everywhere also in China. We are expanding our strategies and doing pretty well. So I think the Asia strategy is working pretty well.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "So net-net that transaction growth you expect will accelerate over the next year or so in these two countries based on everything you described?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, Jason. What I would add to that if you think about just Asia, it\u2019s about 20% of the market opportunity, but it\u2019s only about 8% to 9% of our revenue. So we continue to have a lot of opportunities to gain share there.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Let me switch gears for a second to pricing, and I know you guys talked about an overall 3% pricing investment for this year and then you had a nice chart in your deck showing the walk from transaction growth down to revenue growth and there's a couple of pieces there that are price related. One of them looks to be a mix of domestic price reduction in mix and then you've got the other bucket of other price reductions, so in aggregate those two buckets look like they're bigger than 3%, so does that mean that the net impact of price reductions on revenue is going to diminish as we go through the balance of the year?", "In other words it seemed like more than 3% pricing investment in Q1 so does that moderate later in the year to get you to 3% for the full year?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, Jason it does moderate, it is higher in the first quarter. If you may recall we\u2019d launched the domestic pricing initiative, most of that was October 1, we did some things in the second or third quarter last year, but we\u2019ll begin to lap that as we get to the latter part of 2010. We\u2019ve been pleased with the domestic initiatives and I think what's important there, that business is profitable. It\u2019s got 30% margins, transactions were up 18%. So we very much like what we see there, but on a full-year basis our pricing will be about 3% of our consolidated revenues.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "Okay. So the really improvement will be in Q4 revenue when you anniversary the domestic?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, little bit in the second and third quarter, but lot of it in Q4.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS", "On the US bill pay business I know you said that's still kind of weak, how much of a turnaround there is embedded in your guidance for 2010?", "Christina Gold", "", "I think if we look at Hikmet can talk to you some of the initiatives, that he's putting in place, but I think it's still going to be a challenge, business on the bill pay in the US side but the B2B is our real opportunity.", "Hikmet Ersek", "But don't forget that our payment service, bill payment is still a very strategic initiative for us, especially walk in our agents like that customers walk in and to do transactions there, so and it\u2019s still a very profitable business [for us]. Now what we are doing is definitely we\u2019re looking and have a very hard look on the bill payment business, we\u2019re looking at the processes, we\u2019re looking at the cost structure to improve the business there, but strategically it\u2019s important business and it's still heavily linked to the greater sensitive areas of the US economy which still remain challenged. So I think when that picks up, then it will be back.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "We were curious to see just what we could expect from Hikmet in terms of changes and what his operating priorities might be for the next few years?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I\u2019m very fortunate that I have a business, which I have a tailwind, let me phrase like that. We are present in 200 countries, we have a fantastic business, it\u2019s a global business. And I\u2019ve been fortunate also being with that business for last 10 years. I remember in the early stages I was celebrating 75,000 locations with some of my colleagues and we were dreaming above 100,000 locations. Now we are over 450,000 locations. So it is a very great business and I\u2019m going to use that tailwind and I am also fortunate that I have a long relationship with Christina, which she supported with me for many years. Also additional on that, definitely we are looking on expanding our customer segment, we are looking on the electronic channels. The beauty of our business is being present in 450,000 locations globally everywhere in 200 countries and if you link the electronic channels with our locations, (inaudible) that gives the opportunity also the future opportunity for this company. So, I\u2019m very optimistic about that and we will definitely drive this under my leadership also.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "Hikmet, I think you touched on something interesting which is the idea that you have to sort of manage the emerging channels versus the agent network, how do you go or how do you think about that in the next few years? Do you feel that the agent network maybe has some levels of critical mass at this point where you can focus more on new channels or is there still the need to grow that pretty aggressively as you go forward over the next five years?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think our core business is doing pretty well. I have been in market for many years especially in emerging countries, if you say that that cash has some value, I think that will definitely continue to grow and still customers are carrying cash to the location and pay off in cash. In Africa or Asia you could see that our locations are kind of manpowered ATMs for the customer.", "However, on the sending side, me being a immigrant and using westernunion.com at midnight afterhours sending money from my ATM to a location, both at anytime, I think that\u2019s the connection what I\u2019m talking about. If you look at westernunion.com or account-based money transfer electronic, its growing 60% especially international part and we are now in more than 15 counties and we are expanding that one and our agents especially our bank agents are very welcoming on the send side to support so many things that their accounts are linked electronically to our 450,000 locations globally.", "John Williams - Goldman Sachs", "What do you expect of C2B margin, how should we think about that as we go forward in the next year or two?", "Scott Scheirman", "One of our key priorities in C2B in global business payments, especially with the US bill payment businesses we need to stabilize that topline revenue and so tied to the sub-prime in the US. We need to continue to focus on doing that.", "We have to carefully manage our costs and get efficiencies there, but also it will be important in that segment is that we continue to expand our product offering through B2B and also through geographic expansion of bill payments to selective countries. So we\u2019ll continue to work through that, but our priority is really getting the topline to go north as we think about this on a long-term basis.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "You have provided the South Asia part of it, but if you can provide a breakout of how things are going in Europe, particularly with regards to PSD?", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure, let me talk about Europe and South Asia little bit, Europe most markets in Europe we saw stable to improving performance, so we like what we are seeing in Europe. There are markets such as Spain where there continues to be some challenges, slight negative growth there but we continue to see that abate as we move forward.", "The other area we\u2019ve got our eye on is the gulf area, the transactions will come flat for the first quarter, so we\u2019ll continue to monitor that but from a PSD stand point we continue to make progress there. We think that is very nice opportunity for us. We continue to sign, retailers and in particular we\u2019re focused on Germany and France and I can let Hikmet comment on what the teams have been focused on in particular but we see that as a nice long-term opportunity.", "Hikmet Ersek", "As I mentioned in the previous calls for Germany and France, it\u2019s an important opportunity. Also in other countries like Benelux countries. As you know in these countries we had banking channels as our agents, which limited opening hours. Now with the PSD license we can have also retail chains and we are targeting 10,000 locations, additional 10,000 locations by year end in Europe and I think we are on the good progress to reach that.", "We already have a little below 1000 locations activated especially in these countries where we are heavily bank channels. So we see good progress activating these locations and we see already the transfers, transactions coming from these locations, so I think it\u2019s a good strategy.", "Scott Scheirman", "One thing I would add is not related to PSD, but also in Europe we are going little bit further east, so nice transactions growth in Russia too. Russia is doing well.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Okay further update on Gulf, which I believe did play a part in your overall revenue guidance three months ago. Some of our checks show that although Dubai itself is still quite slow with construction project cancellations and hold ups in other parts of the Gulf, construction activity is coming back, is that similar to what you are seeing and would that over the course of the year have a tendency to provide upside?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Growth is individual for country by country mix. Some countries like Qatar, Kuwait are doing pretty well, but some countries like UAE are still challenging. It\u2019s not only Dubai, some of other countries are still challenging, but we believe you know we will return to growth late 2010 and when the constructions picks up and it will have an effect to our transactions.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "On bank relationships, should we expect more along the lines of some of the ones that you signed last year and if you could also provide some idea of progress on those relationships?", "Christina Gold", "The projects did very well in the US, the US bank results have been excellent. Fifth Third is ramped up and active and now they are 13% of our distribution in the US. We are looking at a couple of other banks that are close to signing, so hopefully we will have some news for you in the next few weeks in terms of finalizing notes, agreements as well but we\u2019re very confident in our footprint and our banking strategy in the US. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from line of Jim Kissane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Jim Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Can you provide little more color on customers, I know you touched on it in the slides, but maybe the year-over-year growth and the margin trends and also maybe what the incremental cost to build out the operations are?", "Christina Gold", "I can talk a little bit about sort of the growth and then Scott can talk a little bit too the cost. I think that as you saw in the fourth quarter we had $23 million worth of the revenue and this quarter we have $26 million. Also they were not part of our business last and first quarter, but they did grow over their own numbers from last year. The focus what we have done is really focus on US and Canada right now because Canada was underrepresented in their numbers and the US numbers were about you know well over 20%, 30%, 40% in that range.", "So they were getting tremendous new customer acquisition there. So we feel really good about what they are executing and the investments are reasonable. We\u2019re taking it step-by-step, making sure that we are going to get the return on our investments, but we feel very confident in what they are doing.", "Scott Scheirman", "Investments are very reasonable, the base business before the investments are amortization and intangibles, it is profitable for sure, it is growing. And then really just speaking, if you look at the margin profile we said it will slightly dilutive in 2010 and I mean slightly dilutive and we don\u2019t expect dilution beyond 2010.", "So, we think given the market opportunity and the ability to leverage our brand, our core competencies, it\u2019s really a good investment for us to make at this stage of the game.", "Jim Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Answering Ashwin\u2019s question, you kind of touched on PSD, but maybe can you kind of pinpoint FEXCO and how that\u2019s driving the PSD initiative?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure, we have a really great platform. I think that was a very strategic good investment. We have our sales people on the FEXCO, on the field getting more retail agents to on our network and the beauty of that is that we are a direct agent. We are the agents here and we have a direct access to the small retailer and that helps us also on our commission and on our cost structure also that having that direct access and also direct promotions, placing the ethnic marketing there, having the sales people direct connection with that, that helps a lot, I think the FEXCO acquisition was a very good and appropriate acquisition.", "Christina Gold", "The other thing I would just add Jim is that also with that we acquired the platform called [Fexlink] which we are now putting into all of our send locations, which really is a web-based technology which allows us not only to do our regular money transfer, but to add other products like mobile, like prepaid into the transactions.", "So, that is really good as well and our U.K. business where FEXCO is really based was our top performer of our plan last year. So, really it is paying off and it is doing a lot for our business.", "Jim Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Doesn\u2019t it make sense at some point to start breaking out westernunion.com? It seems it is becoming a bigger piece and it is driving some growth?", "Christina Gold", "I think as we drive our electronic channels and it becomes a bigger part of our business like we said, it\u2019s 2% of our business as we gained scale on that we would open that up, but not right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "I just wanted to talk about the World Bank report. Over the weekend, the World Bank raised its forecast for 2010 and 2011 for remittance flows, is Western Union seeing that same type of momentum?", "Christina Gold", "I think we are really pleased to see the results from the World Bank because obviously it\u2019s an affirmation that the business and the resiliency of our customers and the importance of remittance is in the global economy.", "They are projecting 6% for this year and 7% for next year, interesting to note that our first quarter, our total principle that we moved was 7%. So, we are off to a very good start. I think the other thing that we are seeing is particularly in the month of March, we saw really an uptick there. That\u2019s where when Mexico went positive.", "That was our record for westernunion.com. So, it\u2019s early days for us in terms of looking at 2010, but I think all of the signs are looking very good for our business. ", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "And typically you guys have beaten the World Bank estimates as you take share?", "Christina Gold", "Yes, we have. If you look at last year they were down minus 6 and we were down minus 3, so if you take the total principle we were twice, we beat them and we always do. ", "Bryan Keane - Credit Suisse", "I just wanted to ask about the PSD. I\u2019ve gotten few questions about just a competitive landscape and how that might change, so now that you are a few months in, I\u2019d interested in Hikmet giving your assessment on that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think Bryan we has the license, which was a big effort. It\u2019s not easy to get the license, right because the regulators are really looking and we had a big effort here. We got the license and I have to say that our sales people are on the field and really getting this retail chain here. It takes some time to having a big retailer, it take some time to activate them because you have to have a house-to- house connection. You have to go to their point of sales system, but you know I think we are very well underway to make a big opportunity out of this.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from line of Jim Wiley with Wells Fargo.", "Jim Wiley - Wells Fargo ", "Thanks, I have one question and one follow up first is in the US market where that spread has widened sequentially from 4Q, which is probably just due to a full quarter effect of the pricing strategy building, but could you talk about monthly, a way to think about how that spread between revenue and transactions, what was it pretty stable as you progress through the quarter or where there any changes?", "Christina Gold", "If we look at the momentum of that business, as we came out of the fourth quarter, we were running transactions at 5%, and now we\u2019re running transactions at 18%, but you need to think that this thing is building momentum, not slowing down so what we\u2019re seeing is month-after-month a strengthening of that business.", "Scott Scheirman", "", "It\u2019s clearly building momentum, I think what\u2019s important to keep in mind Tim is that one, domestic money transfer has got a 30% margin business. It\u2019s a very profitable business for us and then two, we expect positive revenue growth as we get into the later part of 2010.", "Jim Wiley - Wells Fargo ", "Did transaction growth in the US accelerate as the quarter went on, because if I remember I think you said in tees of last year it was like 10% for the month so this quarter's performance would say that you continued to accelerate throughout the quarter? ", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes.", "Jim Wiley - Wells Fargo ", "My follow-up question was just around the electronic channels, as you move forward now over the last couple of years with the variety of different electronic channels whether it\u2019s mobile or account to cash, internet, et cetera . Are you seeing anything within the pricing or the profit metrics around transactions or profit per principle, anything that would you think overtime be sort of a secular negative for the margin structure of Western Union as these channels emerge or do you think you sell price appropriately for the value of the brand?", "Christina Gold", "We see that these electronic channels are margin supportive, I think that overtime we will continue to gain share in the electronic channels and build, so I think even then as we drive more transactions that we will leverage even more of our cost structures. So we feel very comfortable that they will support the overall margin of the business. ", "Thank you very much for being on the call today. We look forward to talking to you again and Hikmet congratulations to you. Thanks everybody", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation.

We are pleased with the quarter's results as the positive momentum we experienced in our C2C business at the beginning of the year has continued in the second quarter. Thanks to the diversified nature of our portfolio, global transaction growth increased to 9% led by improvement in the Americas region. Our operating margin, excluding restructuring expenses, was 27%, 150 basis point improvement from the first quarter, and earnings per share, excluding restructuring, increased 16% from the second quarter of last year. We grew our agent locations to almost 430,000 in the quarter and we purchased $217 million of stock and paid $40 million of dividends. So on many fronts, it was a good quarter and our business is on track as we enter the second half of the year. ", "", "Longer-term, we continue to have global opportunities to increase our market share in money transfer through network growth, focus marketing and consumer segment expansion. We can enhance our growth by offering new products like Prepaid to existing consumers and building our position in new consumer segments such as small and medium enterprise business-to-business payments.

Although there have been challenges, I believe the foundation is strong and the company is well positioned for future growth. Today, Western Union has a strong global brand, an unmatched network, the right strategies of solid financial position and an energized management team under Hikmet Ersek's leadership ready to move forward. At this time, I would like to turn the rest of the call over to Hikmet and Scott who will give you more perspective on the quarter, as well as take your questions. Hikmet?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. I would like to take a moment to once again thank Christina for her leadership and contributions to Western Union over the years and wish her the best. I agree with her that the foundation of the company is strong and the opportunities are big and Mike's team is excited about leading Western Union into its next stage. ", "", "This morning, I would like to give you some more color on the second quarter results. Many markets contributed to the performance in the quarter. The Americas delivered further improvements with double-digit transaction gain and its first revenue increase since the second quarter of 2008. Our international markets also had solid growth even with economic challenges in some parts of the world. Although our U.S. bill payment business declined as expected in the quarter on the other side, customers deliver good results with $28 million in revenues, up from $26 million in the first quarter.", "", "We continue to make advances and retro [ph] (11:26) accomplish money transfer and various mobile initiatives as we leverage our network brand and compliance capabilities. This stinient [ph] (11:35) of comp transaction in international markets increased over 60% in the quarter. The comp-based money transfer transaction, which includes both account-to-cash and cash-to-account, with banks grew more than 70%. In mobile, we have now enabled over 60,000 agent locations in 17 countries to provide cash-to-mobile service and we have begun a pilot program in Malaysia offering mobile-to-cash. We are moving forward with our Prepaid strategy as we now have over 500,000 Prepaid Cards in force and over 8,000 retail locations offering the cards. Let's now take a more detailed look at our results.", "", "Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region group transactions 5%. Revenue declined 1% as currency translation of the euro negatively impacted results, but revenue increased on a constant currency basis. The transaction increased by slightly below the first quarter, 6% increase as we saw some further slowdown in the Gulf. In Europe, as you are all well aware, there were some other challenges in some countries brought on by the sovereign debt crisis. Our diversified portfolio however, delivers overall transaction growth in the European. A large markets such U.K. and Germany performed well. ", "", "We continue to expect our network in Europe. We recently announced the addition of Yapi Kredi Bank, a competitive takeaway and one of the largest banks in Turkey with more than 800 locations. We have a strong agent network in Europe today, primarily two banks and post offices and we are continuing to diversify our agent edition of retail accounts. We are making very good progress signing new retailers although the activation of services taking slightly longer than expected. We previously anticipated having 10,000 new retail agent locations activated by year-end and we now project we will reach this level mid-2011. We expect a new retail account in Europe built at closer to 1% of revenue for Western Union in 2011. ", "", "Two recent additions to retail distribution signings are the OMV oil and gas group and Telecorp. The OMV agreement will allow us to provide money transfer services in over 1,800 gas stations across eight European countries, tele-query [ph] (13:57) the Telecorp division of the large Spanish retail group, El Corte Ingles. These are two more examples of how we are expanding our European distribution to new classes of trade and reaching new consumers. Recently the retail opportunity in Europe is large and we are laying a solid foundation for future success.", "", "Continuing on with our review on the region's quarterly results. Russia again performed well. We have also increased our strategic operations in the country, including launching electronic account-based money transfer with Moscrum PrivatBank [ph] (14:31), our second partner bank in Russia to offer this service. Transactions in the Gulf States were down moderately in the quarter compared to a year ago at challenges in the UE and Saudi Arabia offset growth in some other Gulf countries. Now our outlook for the year, we are projecting continued softness for the Gulf in the second half. We believe, however, the long-term prospects are healthy and infrastructure projects in the Gulf are expected to resume. They're also continuing to inventify [ph] (15:02) new corridors and develop partners for alternative channels such as mobile and account-based money transfer to help to drive our business in the Gulf States.", "", "India reported revenue growth of 4% on transaction growth of 3% in the quarter. We recently added a new agent in India, Bandhan Financial Services, a major microfinance services company with over 800 locations across the country. We also made an important advance in our electronic challenge initiatives as we signed an agreement with our agent, State Bank of India, that will allow now for cash day comp [ph] (15:38) transactions. Beginning in 2011, Indians working and living overseas will be able to send international cash transfers progress the entire tint of the earth [ph] (15:46) State Bank of India online banking linked accounts. The State Bank of India agreement represents another step for Western Union to provide additional online services to consumers and follow the cash-to-account service implemented at guaranteed by in Turkey last year.", "", "Turning now to Americas region. The improvement continues with 12% transaction growth and the 1% revenue increase in the quarter. U.S. domestic money transfer was a major contributor to the transaction increase and results were stronger than expected across the region. Americas represented 32% of total company revenues in the quarter. ", "", "The Mexico business turned positive with transaction growth of 5% and the revenue increase of 4%. Although U.S. employment has not improved dramatically, stabilized economic trends are helping Mexico revidend [ph] (16:39). We also had a strong response to our Mother's Day promotion and we believe our Mexico business benefited from the success of our U.S. domestic group positioning. Also the U.S. outbound business continued its positive performance with most corridors delivering strong transaction growth and improving revenue trends. ", "", "In U.S., domestic money transfer are repositioning plan that is working. The new pricing and promotions help drive an increase in domestic money transfer transactions of 28%, up from 18% in the first quarter, while revenue declined 10%. For the second quarter in a row, we saw transaction increase across all our domestic principal banks with the $50 and under bank delivering the highest growth. We are on track to deliver domestic revenue growth later in the year and we continue to see operating margins over 30% from this business. ", "", "Finally, the U.S. the roll-out of our Prepaid Card continues. We began retail distribution at the end of the first quarter and now, we have over 8,000 locations carrying our cards.

Revenue in the international C2C business grew 2% in the quarter or 4% constant currency on transaction growth of 7%. Performance was driven by continued strong trends in the U.S. outbound business, as well as growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, partially offset by modest transaction declines in the Gulf States. The company's C2C cross-border principle volume increased 6% in the quarter or 7% constant currency, and we believe we continue to gain global market share.", "", "C2C principal per transaction decreased 2% compared to the same period a year ago. The constant currency principle per transaction decline has moderated over each of the past two quarters. The spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was eight percentage points or seven points excluding the impact of currency. Similar to the first quarter, the factors affecting the currency-adjusted spread included the domestic money transfer repositioning, international pricing and mix. The success of the U.S. domestic repositioning and specifically strong growth in the 50 and under principle band continued in the quarter. Domestic money transfer contributed four points of the transaction-to-revenue spread as a result of both pricing and mix.", "", "Excluding currency and the impact from domestic money transfer, the other factors impacting the transaction in revenue spread were generally consistent with prior quarters.

We expect the second half to be slightly above this level, resulting in a full year expense of approximately 4%. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.33 or $0.36, excluding restructuring expenses. On a constant currency basis, EPS was $0.01 higher or $0.37, excluding restructuring expenses.

Due to the strong success of the $5 for $50 U.S. domestic money transfer business, our calculated pricing investment for the year is anticipated to be closer to 4%. As a reminder, our pricing calculation includes all transactions in a newly priced band so a large increase in transactions will impact what we report.

Is that all resolved now? Or do you still have some issues to resolve?", "Scott Scheirman", "Jim, we still have some issues to resolve. The items that we did resolve this quarter were, I would say, smaller items. The item that we're still working through is the international restructuring we did back in 2003 that relates to that $250 million refundable tax deposit. But we were able to favor resolve several items that had some help to the tax rate this quarter and for the full year.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And Hikmet, can you maybe quantify or give us a sense of the halo effect, the U.S. pricing actions and the impact on the U.S. to Mexico business? And related to that, maybe your sense of share gains in domestic U.S. and U.S. to Mexico?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. I think this U.S. domestic pricing action is one of our most successful actions, I mean we have 28% transaction growth this quarter compared to 18% transaction growth in first quarter. This obviously attracts customer to our retailers and this retail attracting customer have also halo effect to our South American customer, Mexican customer. We saw transactions grow in Mexico to 5% transaction growth and 4% revenue growth, which is a big thing here, right? And we are very attractive [ph] (38:57) so it had to have that effect and also videos [ph] (48:01) on the U.S. outbound business improvement.

What are the factors driving that? Is there any seasonality there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think customers business as you know, in Q1 we had $26 million and now Q2 is $28 million. I think customers, the core business remains profitable. We do see good progress in our international, especially Canada and Australia business. And we also started to put our sales efforts in the U.S. We believe U.S. market is a big market here. We opened sales offices where our people are getting new customers and we opened one in New Jersey and one, I believe, in Atlanta. And we are also underway to opening one more in Chicago area. So I think we are targeting customers and expanding our business. So that has an impact and we really believe it's a huge business. And also we are, the use of PSD license, the European union, our PSD license in European union allows also to expand customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Can you just touch on a little more detail around what's actually driving the revenue guidance increase on a constant currency basis? And what assumptions you're including in your growth around the bill pay business for the rest of the year?", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure, Darrin. On the constant currency guidance, we did increase at 1% compared to the prior outlook and now we're at a range of 0% to 3%. Broadly, we've seen a strong performance, and the Americas business would be the primary factor. If you look at domestic money transfer, we saw a 28% transaction growth, although revenue was down somewhat, we expect revenue to be positive as we get to the fourth quarter and have got 30% margin. But also within the Americas, Mexico was solid and U.S. outbound business continues to perform nicely given the backdrop of the global economy. If you go around the globe, there are some, if you will, puts and takes. Europe, we saw growth there, but we are keeping our eye on the Gulf. Our outlook for the Gulf is continued softness. Regarding the bill payment business and our outlook there, comments real similar to what we talked about in January is that we think 2010 will look a fair amount like 2009. Our opportunities with bill payments are continuing to consolidate that with the Americas region to look for revenue and expense synergies. And then look at product and geographic diversification. Clearly Custom House is a nice opportunity for us. It's a small business but just as we globalize the C2C business, our longer-term we want to globalize the B2B business.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Then just a follow-up on the -- some of the newer initiatives. I mean the trends are pretty impressive, I think, across the board. I mean the payment services direct of you have mentioned. Can you just repeat some of the data points? You had mentioned growing at some substantial rate and adding about 1% of revenue there. And then also on the Prepaid business, the growth there -- I mean up to $500,000. I think you had previously guided towards ending the year at 750,000 cards. It seems like you're trending better than that already. Is that fair?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think we do have a focus, obviously, on the new initiatives and the team is working very hard to launch the new initiative. On the PSD side, I think we recently signed new retailers and in Europe, you have the banking and postal preserve very strong agent relationship. The retailers we are signing new like OMV or Telecorp from Corte Ingles are new big retailers and I'm very excited, for instance, about the OMV signing, it's a gas station which offers 24 hour service, which we didn't have in the past in Europe. We had banking or limited banking opening hours, so we're going to serve new customers. We believe that activation takes a bit more longer time to activate these locations because for the retailers, financial services also new in Europe. However, we believe we're going to get 10,000 locations by mid-2011 and that reflects about 1% additional incremental revenue from total receiving revenue this new initiative will bring. On the Prepaid side, I'm also very excited this could be new big initiative for Western Union. I think we started -- not in the U.S., it's in early stages, but our first indications are quite impressive. We have 500,000 cards-in-force and we are well underway to reach our 750,000 cards by year-end. And I believe that could be also -- especially given our global retails international expansion rate, that could be a huge opportunity for the future.", "Scott Scheirman", "And, Darrin, a lot of the 500,000 Prepaid Cards came from direct mailing campaigns. And now as we switch to more retail distribution, we ramp up that distribution and it'll be a little bit of a different pace for the next couple of quarters.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And you're at about 8,000 locations now?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and there's obviously more if it's about 50,000 in the U.S. overall?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes. We think there's tremendous opportunity in the U.S. not only in our existing network but other networks in the U.S. And then there's global opportunities, too -- we don't want to get too far ahead of our selves -- but we think globally, there's opportunities with Prepaid.", "Hikmet Ersek", "We're going to share more information on that in our September investors meeting.

Or is that share gains that you're taking? I just want to be clear there.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we see some stabilized economic trends in the U.S. I think it is, although the unemployment rate has not improved in U.S., we do see some stabilizing. The other thing we also see is that our reasons of defeat could around [ph] (45:39) the domestic money transfer and the other one is also the Mother's Day went pretty well. We had good feedback on the Mother's Day so the response was very well. So I think overall market condition has a halo effect and Mother's Day had an impact on our Mexico business.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, and just looking at the bigger picture, in the history of Western Union, is it typical that the Americas would recover first before Europe and the Middle East coming out of a recession?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I mean if you look at our business, we are really a global company in 200 countries, right? We do see improvements in parts of the world, we do see still challenges like in the Gulf States or in Spain. The unemployment rate in Spain is not a new story for you, but it's still challenging. However, that helps our portfolio, our diversified portfolio helps to respond to the trends but also to the opportunities globally and we are very fortunate to have that.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "But historically, do we usually see stronger U.S. markets, domestic markets, and then the Europe and Middle East will lag? Because that's kind of -- it looks like that's what we're seeing here.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, first of all I would say that in the U.S., we've been much more longer, right? And in the other countries, we been 15 to 20 years in Europe, right? So historically, and the recession we have two years ago never happened in the past, right? So it is a different situation, I would say. I wouldn't draw any trends out of this but I think we are very happy with the quarterly results in Q2.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then just finally, what are the expectations for Europe and the Gulf for the rest of 2010? Do you expect similar trends that you saw in Q2? Do you expect kind of a decrease in transaction volumes in those areas?", "Scott Scheirman", "Bryan, this is Scott. The Gulf, our outlook considers continued softness, if you will, as we think about the next two quarters. And then with Europe, we saw a growth there. So we're still anticipating some growth there as we move through Europe. But I think what's good about our business is we're in 200 countries. Outside of the U.S., no one country's more than 6% of our top line. So it gives us some balance as we go around the globe and as economies enter different stages of stabilization or recovery.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Frisch of Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Given some of the changes in the agent contracting practices, specifically with regard to either exclusivity or pricing, what can we expect with the delta between transaction and revenue growth in the next few quarters?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think generally, or obviously, depending really on the countries and depending on the regions, depending on the corridor, our agent contracts. I think we are in most of our countries we have exclusive long-term agent agreements and it's been positioned that the agents are very happy with our contract and we are very happy with our agent contracts, right? In countries where we the regulatory environment doesn't allow to have exclusivity, we don't have -- it depends on the agent relationship -- but most of them are exclusive to us and have a long-term relationship. And I think our commissions are favorable to the agent. So in this situation, if agents are happy, our consumers are happy and we are happy. So we are really have a pretty well agent relationship. On that, maybe Scott, do you...", "Scott Scheirman", "Just two points I would add, Adam, is that on agent commissions, if you will, specifically there that we continue to sign agents at lower commission rates, as we can renegotiate existing agents to lower commission rates strategically, not one-size-fits-all. And then as you're asking about transaction and revenue spread, as you saw from Q1 to Q2, that spread did come down specifically, we'll begin lapping the domestic money transfer price actions in the fourth quarter. So that should help some narrowing of that spread when we believe domestic revenue will grow in the fourth quarter.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Just following up on the domestic side, I think Jim has some of the stuff but, obviously, when you lap it, we're now going to see a transaction growth. We've seen it's going to go lower, but we're also now going to see the negative revenue growth, if that's going to turn positive. Can you give us an idea of what we can expect in the domestic corridor going forward after we kind of get rid, or after we have or lap these four quarters, of some pretty nuance kind of trends?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think -- I'm just very proud of my team and Stewart, I think we did an excellent job here. It's more than a pricing action. It's really a promotion using all four Ps [ph](50:56), and we turned around on debt seized [ph](50:57) also. It's really over our expectations, we were planning that one. And the revenue turn back will come at Q4. So I think we built a real foundation that attracts customers. I believe it's a long-term opportunity here to domestic money transfer. Also, we are attracting new customers, right? It's not only turning around exiting customers also with $5 for $50 lower band [ph](51:23), newer customers are coming to our locations. So I believe that has a longer response, longer way to go.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Obviously, you mentioned the Analyst Day's coming up at the end of September. Not to steal your thunder, but what kind of information or agenda can we expect at that event? Just trying to gauge what kind of catalyst that may be.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, first of all, we will definitely talk about our Global core business, core money transfer business, retail money transfer, global expansion, and we will also have a focus on the new initiatives like electronic channels, but also Prepaid Card, mobile, you will hear more color around that. Also we're going to talk about processes, our processes, speak to the market and productivity, give you a little bit strategy about Western Union going to looking forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "First, I want to ask about C2C margins; that was up quite nicely. It looks like it broke through 29%. Can you give us some detail on what's driving that, if it's sustainable? Because it sounds like aside from marketing, I would think that the mix towards domestic should help, as well as your restructuring, so I'm curious if that level is sustainable.", "Scott Scheirman", "Well, we do believe that, Tien-Tsin. This is Scott. We do believe that the 2010 margins for C2C will be greater than the 2009 margins. So clearly, we think we've got a business model that can drive margin expansion on a long-term basis. 65% of the costs are variable, 35% are fixed. So as the market improves, as revenue re-accelerates, we believe there's opportunities to, if you will, push more dollars to the bottom line. Clearly balancing that with, what are the investment needs of the business to continue growing the top line. But we like what we saw there in the second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we do expect our C2C margins in 2010 to be a little bit higher than they were in 2009.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Right. I mean, Scott, any beyond marketing in the FX? Are there any major drags that we should consider for the second half, maybe if I'd ask it that way?", "Scott Scheirman", "For the second half, it's be, I'd say, just timing of expense spending. You mentioned marketing. Marketing was a little bit less than 4% first half. It'll be a little bit more than 4% second half. FX, hard to call for sure, but with this new outlook, we did increase, excluding restructuring expenses, Tien-Tsin, increase our outlook for our margins from say 26% to least a range of 26% to 26.5%.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Right. Okay, good. The domestic transactions, I wanted to ask about that too. That was a large sequential increase and it seems to imply a pretty big uptick in the lower band products, the $5 for $50 that you've been talking about. Can you give us more statistics on that? And to what extent it's driving new revenues? How do you measure that?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, it did have a nice effect. Transaction growth in the first quarter was 18% and, to your point, moved to 28% in the second quarter. And we're seeing some really nice success in the $5 for $50 and believe a number of those transactions are new customers or customers that we haven't seen for a while. And it seems the team's done a good job of almost creating a new category where you might give a $50 gift or one in your friends might be having few challenges and you wire him $50. I also think on a longer-term basis, as we talk about goCASH, I think that'll be another helpful product for our domestic and for our Global business where between Family Dollar and Murphy Oil, we'll have over 7,500 locations offering that product by the time we exit 2010.", "Hikmet Ersek", "That's an exciting product, is goCASH.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Just PSD, what's driving the push out in the PSD retails? I think you said now it's mid-'11 as opposed to year-end for the 10,000 locations?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think our strategy in Europe is working with PSD expanding tangent to retail. We have a huge pipeline, signing pipeline, as you know, recently announced also the OMV and TeleCorp is one of the examples of huge retailers. But it takes some time to activate them because it's also retail -- financial service for retailers in Europe is something new. And their system, all this activation takes some time to do that and that's why it's 2011, takes a little bit. But we are very, very optimistic and I believe that 1% driven incremental revenue for 2011. We are on track on that. So I think we are quite optimistic on that.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "All right. Just a regulatory question if I could. I guess anything in the financial reform bill that could have a direct or indirect impact on you or your agents that we should consider?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think first of all, the law just passed, right? It's really new and I believe maybe the disclosure part for the agent location will be impacted. But I think we are very well prepared to respond to that. But we are looking at it as just passed and we are watching it.", "Scott Scheirman", "And Tien-Tsin, the other probably two things I would add that we're closely working with, and to Hikmet's point, it's early days now and there's a lot of rule maintenance probably going to have to happen, but in addition to see in FX disclosure requirements a point-of-sale, which we do. We print a receipt, we give disclosure today. There may have to be some pre-transaction disclosure that we'll have to look through, but we've got the systems, the automation to do that. But in the Prepaid area, it does look like general-purpose reloadable cards are exempt, so that's good news, if you will. And then finally, in the derivative area, Western Union, like many global companies, uses forwards for hedging. Within that, if you get some forwards that are underwater, you may have to post collateral. We've got ample cash to do that. And then specifically as relates to Custom House in the U.S., it looks like a majority of the Custom House business in the U.S. would be exempt from that. But we're closely monitoring that. And some of this is going to take some time with rule making over the next nine, 15, 18 months as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Parker of Lazard Capital Markets.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Just a close follow-up to Tsin-Tien's question: Can you just give us any general thoughts on the recent actions in Arizona? And around potential for immigration reform in the U.S.?", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure. Just broadly, we think comprehensive immigration reform would be good. It would provide certainty to a lot of, I'll use the word stakeholders, in all this consumers, everybody. So far, we have not seen any impact on our business in Arizona. And as a reminder, Arizona's one of 50 states; the U.S. is one of 200 countries. So it's relatively small; important, but small in the scheme of things.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then just can you provide us an update on the strategy with the Vigo brand? We continue to see just lower advertising and marketing around that brand and understand that some of the restructuring impact did to that business, but are you continuing to invest in that brand going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think Vigo is for us a very important brand. It's really a competitive -- we have a second brand especially for our Mexico and Latin America corridors, we do have the brand and I believe that it really helps to drive our transactions and to our growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just want to get an update on sort of the bank distribution progress and strategy in the U.S. and just a little bit of color on the pipeline of potential future banks for distribution.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. In the U.S., we have the U.S. Bank and Fifth Third Bank as active banks, and we have a pipeline. We are looking at it in the U.S. and people are working on the pipeline. I think it's important strategy to expand our network on the U.S. banking strategy because, as you know, in Europe, we have the banks and post offices, other financial services in our networks and where we start in Europe getting retail, we started to get it also in the U.S. Banks in the USA. So it is important strategy for us and we think -- it's also helping us for the future for our account-based money transfer will help us to reaching to our new customers, account holders. That will also help us to expand our transactions.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay. And then I want to go back to the U.S. repositioning for a second. It looked like the transaction growth, obviously, the 28% was great, but the spread between the revenue decline and the transactions kind of widened. And I guess it's really due to the mix, which Tien-Tsin was getting at. But is there any way to sort of think about the average price decline per transaction? And I'm also trying to think about what revenue growth could look like in the fourth quarter as we anniversary sort of the repositioning initiatives.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, it's hard to give you one simple answer on what is the revenue transaction decline because one of our challenges with the market, historically, is our pricing was a little bit all over the board. So one of our key strategies was to get to consistent price points, which allows you to do national advertising and marketing and clearer communication with customers. We do believe that as we get to the fourth quarter, we will have positive revenue growth, and that spread between transactions and revenue should narrow.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then finally, I know a lot of people are sort of worried about the European trends sort of inter-quarter. Is there any way you could sort of give us some help on what you saw monthly throughout the quarter, April, May, June? What the trends might have been in Europe?", "Scott Scheirman", "I won't get into real specifics month-by-month, but let me give you some color on a couple of countries within Europe. I mean, the good news within the EU is we have a balanced portfolio. If you take countries such as the U.K. and Germany were solid. Countries such as Spain continues to be challenged. No surprises there, 20% employment in construction. But it speaks to the beauty of our business model that we have 200 countries around the globe and 25 to 27 countries in the EU, which provides that balance.", "Hikmet Ersek", "The portfolio effect, I can't see that the EU -- is it [ph](1:02:13) worldwide. We're in 200 countries or we're into European and we've entered 27 countries. You see the portfolio effect. That's the meat of our business.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "My question is on the Global Payments side of things. Do you look at Custom House as having a set level of revenue in the future? So that you can get adjusted margins in that segment to stabilize and perhaps even rise? And partly it would help if you gave sort of a split out for the restructuring between C2C and Global Payments.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Let me start with the general Custom House. I think with the acquisition of Custom House, we really added something very interesting, and we are entering some new customer-based B2B transactions here. And this is especially international strategy are very mutually important for us. I mean if you look at the customers, currently, they're in several countries, most of them are Anglo-Saxon countries. And given our 200 global -- being present in 200 countries on our global reach, if you combine with that, that could be an opportunity. And with the existing market, we elevated sales from $26 million to $28 million quarter-over-quarter increase. So I think we are very much, we believe in Custom House, that could be an opportunity for the future. But we have to think bigger of that -- I believe also that B2B generally could be besides the customers and opportunities where we are looking. The small business entities who have globally needs to transfer from country to country money, we believe we could be playing in a niche market there.", "Scott Scheirman", "The only thing I would add is on the restructuring, that part of your question, if you will. What we did, we did or we will take about an $80 million charge, but it has a $50 million annual fit [ph](1:04:38) benefit in savings. And what I would add there is that was a comprehensive review of the global organization, both C2C, Global Business Payments, really with an aim in mind to improve speed and improve execution and drive long-term growth.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. With regards to Hikmet's comments then on the B2B side, should we look for more M&A in the space? Following customers?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think what we are looking at is that we have now customers, we are in an integration phase of the customers. I think next year, it won't be diluted anymore. I believe that we have a good base here to expand our business. We start to hire sales people in the U.S., and I think our Australia and or Canada business playing pretty well. We are looking at that part and the customers currently.", "Christina Gold", "Thank you very much for being on the call today. And, again, it's been a pleasure working with all of you but I also wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate our agents and our employees for a great quarter, again showing the strength of our company, our brand and our ability to really service our customers. So thank you, and I know that Hikmet's looking forward to great things in the future, and thank you again.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Christina.

My name is Chris, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Salop, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Michael Salop", "Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, we will have comments from Hikmet Ersek, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in a supplemental table with our press release. Since we previously discussed expected revenue and transaction trends on September 29 and held our Investor Day on September 30, we will keep our comments today fairly brief.", "As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2009 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everybody, on the call. As Mike mentioned, approximately a month ago at the Investors Day, we gave you a strategy and business update. Now I'm pleased to report at the close of third quarter by making steady progress with our business across the globe.", "Transaction and constant-currency revenue trends in our Consumer-to-Consumer business have now improved for four quarters in a row, with overall transaction growth increasing to 10% in the third quarter. Compared to the second quarter, the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions delivered improved trends, and the EMEASA region was steady. We took further steps to expand our retail footprint in Europe through a planned relationship with DHL and to advance our banking strategy in the U.S. by signing an agreement to offer money transfer services at KeyBank.", "In Global Business Payments, the billed payments revenue declined by fairly consistent with the second quarter. Customers delivered a solid $27 million in revenue and remains on track for double-digit revenue growth for the year. We are currently re-branding customers to Western business solutions. I believe Western Union's global brand strength and high awareness level as well as the company's agents and regulatory relationships should benefit our business-to-business category as we expand into new markets.", "In Bill Pay, we are piloting an enhanced walk-in payment service in the U.S. This new service provides repeat customers a simplified, formless process for urgent payments and it's being tested at select agent locations. We also received approvals for our bank license in Brazil, which will allow us to offer Bill Payment like we do it in Argentina, Panama and Peru, as well as intra-country money transfer and other services such as prepaid cards. These are, of course, in addition to our existing cross-boarder Consumer Money Transfer business.", "Now overall, the company generated strong margin improvement in the third quarter, led by the Consumer-to-Consumer business which delivered 30% margins. We continue to generate strong cash flow and return capital to shareholders as we repurchased almost $100 million of stock in the quarter and declared nearly $40 million in dividends. Including the latest dividend, which was paid in October, year-to-date, we have now returned over $630 million to shareholders through repurchase and dividends.", "Now based on the third quarter performance, current business trends and improved tax rate, we are pleased to be able to raise our full year 2010 earnings per share outlook again. Although the environment remains challenging, with high global unemployment, our diversified portfolio is delivering results. The momentum has been positive, and our increased confidence is also allowing us to make incremental investment in the business in the fourth quarter. Scott will give you more details on the third quarter financial results and our outlook in a few minutes. But before this, following our Investors Day presentation, I would like to provide a quick update on progress with our strategic initiatives.", "In Electronic Money Transfer, we continue to grow, westernunion.com transaction in the international markets once again increased over 60% in the quarter. Including the U.S., the global westernunion.com transaction growth was almost 20%.", "Account-based money transfer transaction, which includes both account to cash, cash to account with banks, grew more than 50% in the quarter. We now have 27 banks globally that have agreed to offer this service through Western Union.", "In mobile, we have enabled approximately 70,000 agent locations in 27 countries to provide cash to mobile service. Consumer can also send money transfers to mobile recipients from westernunion.com sites in six countries. We also expanded our relationship with the State Bank of India to allow account holders to receive money transfers in their bank accounts using their mobile phones beginning 2011. In Canada, we entered a strategic alliance with EnStream to allow Zoompass mobile wallet holders to send cross-border and domestic money transfer directly from their mobile phones.", "Electronic channels are still relatively small parts of our portfolio today, of only 2% of revenues. But we continue to grow fast and lay the groundwork for the future. In prepaid, we had over 650,000 cards-in-force at the end of the quarter, and we increased our retail distribution in the U.S. to over to over 9,000 locations.", "As we reported at our Investors Day, year-to-date through the end of September, over $240 million of principal has been loaded on the cards to approximately 1.1 million loads. We began a direct response television campaign in the U.S. for our prepaid cards in the quarter, and also signed an agreement with CCH, a leading provider of software for tax and accounting professionals. This agreement will allow customers to receive U.S. tax refunds on a Western Union MoneyWise Prepaid MasterCard beginning in 2011. We have also initiated plans for expanding prepaid into select international markets with several countries in the works for 2011. We believe the global opportunities for prepaid are large, and we are well positioned to offer this service in the appropriate markets.", "So this is a quick progress update on some of our key initiatives. As we discussed at our recent Investors Day, this organization highly focuses on four key strategic priorities: growing our Retail Money Transfer business; expanding Electronic Channels; developing our product portfolio with new services, such as prepaid cards and business-to-business solutions; and improving processes and productivity.", "Since I was named CEO, I have spent a large amount of my time evaluating the company's competitive position, global market opportunities, organizational capabilities and processes. I strongly believe we now have the right strategy in place and moving forward, our success will be highly dependent on execution. We are creating the proper alignment, processes, tools and incentives to drive results, and I believe it took some encouraging steps in this right direction in the third quarter.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results and the full year outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. Our third quarter revenue and transaction results were consistent with what we reported in our September 29 press release. We are pleased with the continued progress in Consumer-to-Consumer and Western Union business solutions, which was formerly Custom House. While U.S. Bill Payment remains challenging, the rate of decline in Bill Payment did moderate slightly.", "Overall for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue growth of 1% or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Total Western Union transaction fee revenue represented 78% of company revenues and was flat from the prior year. Foreign exchange revenue represented 20% of total company revenue, and increased 11% in the quarter, benefiting from the acquisition of Custom House.", "Our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue increased 1% or 3% in constant currency. As Hikmet noted, each region contributed to this progress with steady to improving trends.", "Transaction growth in our C2C segment continued to accelerate with 10% year-over-year growth. Trends in the international C2C business were comparable to the second quarter. Revenue grew 2% in the third quarter or 4% constant currency on transaction growth of 7%. The company's C2C cross-border principal increased 4% in the quarter or 6% on a constant-currency basis. C2C principal per transaction decreased 4% year-over-year or declined 3% in constant-currency terms, generally in line with recent quarterly trends.", "Turning to our regions. Our C2C business in Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew transactions consistent with the second quarter of 5%. Revenue declined 2%, and was again negatively impacted by currency translation. On a constant-currency basis, EMEASA revenue increased in the quarter.", "We continue to see good performance from large markets, such as the U.K., Germany and Russia, while the Gulf states remained challenged, with transaction declines consistent with the second quarter. India transactions and revenues increased 2%, and transactions continue to be impacted by the Gulf state softness.", "In the quarter, we also launched westernunion.com transaction site in Switzerland, agreement with certain banking partners in Romania, Turkey and Russia to offer account-based money transfer and introduced the Western Union loyalty card in Romania.", "Turning to the Americas region. Momentum continued with 13% transaction growth and 2% revenue increase in the quarter. U.S. domestic repositioning once again drove activity, led by the $0.00 to $50 principal band. Domestic money transfer delivering strong transaction growth of 35% in the quarter, revenue declined only 6%, and we continue to expect positive domestic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Mexico transactions grew 2% as revenue declined 1%, and the U.S. Outbound business continue to perform well, with the Philippines and Jamaican corridors leading the revenue growth.", "The Asia-Pacific region delivered strong performance in the quarter, with growth of 15% in transactions and 12% in revenue. In China, transactions and revenue each grew 6%. We continue to see network expansion in corridor marketing as key drivers to  growing share in this important country, and we'll be activating thousands of new locations with our new and existing bank partners over the next few years.", "The Philippines and Australia also contributed to the regions' growth in the quarter, with especially strong performance of our Intra business in the Philippines. With the overall C2C business, the spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was seven percentage points, excluding the impact of currency, which had a negative two point impact. Consistent with the first half of 2010, the factors affecting the currency-adjusted spread included the domestic money transfer repositioning, international pricing and mix.", "Domestic money transfer contributed four points of the transactions and revenue spread as a result of both pricing and mix. As we begin to anniversary the domestic repositioning in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the C2C transaction revenue spread will narrow, although we believe the $5 price point will still be at an important growth driver going forward.", "Moving to the Global Business Payments segment. Revenue increased 5% or declined 7%, excluding business solutions, consistent with our expectations. While the U.S. business continued to be challenged, particularly by the mortgage market, Banco Brasil in South America had another solid quarter. The integration of the Bill Payment business under the direction of Stewart Stockdale in the Americas region continues, and our objective is to gain revenue and cost efficiencies over time.", "Western Union business solution revenues were strong at $27 million and remain on track for double-digit revenue growth this year. As a reminder, we acquired Custom House in September of 2009, so there was one month of revenue or $8 million in our third quarter results a year ago.", "Turning to our margins. Third quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 26%. Excluding restructuring charges, the consolidated operating margin was 27%. We recorded $14 million of restructuring expenses in the quarter related to our May 27 announcement. Approximately $5 million of the charges is including cost to services, and $9 million is in SG&A. These amounts are not included in our segment operating results.", "For purposes of year-over-year comparisons, the third quarter of 2009 included a $71 million expense accrual related to the settlement with Arizona and several other states. This simplified operational comparisons and excluded both the 2010 restructuring charge and the 2009 settlement accrual from my margin commentary.", "The operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, improved approximately 70 basis points from the third quarter of last year and 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, increased costs related to business solution investment spending and acquisition-related amortization were offset by lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies.", "Third quarter earnings per share were $0.36 or $0.37, excluding restructuring expenses. On a constant-currency basis, EPS was $0.01 higher or $0.38, excluding restructuring. This compares to GAAP EPS of $0.26 in the third quarter of last year or $0.33 excluding the settlement accrual.", "Our C2C segment operating margin was 30%, an increase of 230 basis points over the same period last year. The margin increase was primarily due to lower marketing, operating efficiencies and currency. Segment margin increased 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2010.", "Global Business Payments operating margin of 15% included the Custom House intangible amortization expense and investment spending for future growth. Excluding Business solutions, segment margin of 23% was down from 26% in the third quarter last year, driven by lower U.S. Bill Payments revenue.", "Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong. In the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $384 million, while capital expenditures were $44 million. We repurchased 6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $16.15 per share for a total of $98 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $514 million to repurchase 32 million shares or 5% of the total shares outstanding at an average price of $16.23. As of September 30, we had $486 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization.", "In the quarter, we also declared another $0.06 per share dividend, for which $39 million was paid on October 14. At quarter end, the company had total debt of $3.3 billion, and cash of $2 billion, of which approximately $900 million of cash was outside the United States. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $710 million and includes the impact of the $250 million refundable tax deposit that we made with the IRS in the first quarter.", "Turning to our full year 2010 outlook. As Hikmet mentioned, we are increasing our earnings per share range for the year. Our C2C margins have been strong, our tax rate has improved, and we expect constant-currency revenues will be closer to the higher end of the previous range. The recent strengthening of the euro should aid GAAP revenues in the fourth quarter, although the impact on earnings will be lower due to our hedging programs.  As a result of the hedges, the strengthening of the euro will likely have a negative impact on fourth quarter operating margin.", "We plan to invest in the business in the fourth quarter to aid future growth, including incremental marketing spending and other strategic investments. The additional marketing spend will include investments and loyalty programs and general holiday advertising and promotion. We expect our marketing percentage, which was slightly below 4% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2010 to be around 5% in the fourth quarter, although for the full year, we should still be at approximately 4%.", "We continue to expect our full year operating margin, excluding restructuring, to be between 26% and 26.5%. Including restructuring charges, we expect GAAP operating margins in the range of 24.5% to 25%. The full year tax rate, excluding restructuring charge, is projected to be between 22% and 23%. Year-to-date through September, our tax rate, excluding restructuring, was approximately 23%. We expect the fourth quarter rate to benefit from one-time adjustments and certain favorable resolutions. We do not expect these benefits to affect the 2011 tax rate. Including the impact of restructuring, the outlook for the GAAP tax rate for the year would be between 21.5% and 22.5%.", "Given all these factors, our updated outlook for full year 2010 is: GAAP revenue growth in the range of plus 1% to plus 2%; constant-currency revenue growth, one point higher than GAAP or plus 2% to plus 3%; GAAP EPS of $1.29 to $1.32, including $0.07 of restructuring charges, EPS of $1.36 to $1.39, excluding restructuring; and constant-currency EPS, $0.01 higher.", "We now expect GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $900 million to $1 billion, including the $250 million reduction in the first quarter refundable tax deposit. Capital expenditures are projected at 2% to 3% of revenue. We continue to expect the majority of the $80 million restructuring charges announced in May to occur in 2010, with approximately $10 million of related savings this year.", "In summary, we are pleased with the improving trends in our business. We have raised our EPS outlook, excluding restructuring, up from their previous outlook of $1.31 to $1.36 to our current outlook of $1.36 to $1.39. We will continue to balance margin enhancement with investments for future growth and believe we have the opportunities for both over the long term.", "That concludes our prepared comments for the quarter. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike.", "Michael Salop", "Thanks, Scott. We'll now move on to the Q&A. In order to maximize the number of people we can get on the call, we do ask that each person limit themselves to one question. Chris, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of Piper Jaffray.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies", "I'd just like to dig a little bit more into the expense improvement and the tax outlook for 2011. I mean, your expenses came in comfortably below what we were looking for. And you did say that marketing was a little bit lower. But where primarily did you come in better than I think what you had anticipated on the operating expense side? And how much of that is sustainable? And what is the tax rate for '11, the outlook?", "Scott Scheirman", "This is Scott. For the third quarter and even year-to-date, 2010, we've had marketing at closer about a little bit less than 4% of revenue. For the fourth quarter, we expect that to be closer to 5%. Although for the full year, it will be around 4% from that standpoint. We have particularly good experience with operating expense efficiency. Both from the restructuring, we did back in May, we'll realize about $10 million of savings this year on that, and then just continuing to leverage our fixed expenses. As far as 2011, it's probably a little bit too early to get into the details of that. We'll provide more details in February. But for sure, we're going to balance investment spending with our margin objectives. And we think as the market improves, as revenue reaccelerates, we've got a business that's set up for margin expansion. But we'll balance that with investing in the business as we move forward.", "Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies", "But just the tax rate is the tax rate from this year like a number we should think about longer term or should it define [ph]?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, I don't want to give any 2011 outlook at this time. But one thing I would emphasize about 2010, that a number of the benefits that we've had to the 2010 tax rate probably will not repeat themselves in 2011. One example I would give you, early in the year, we resolved some tax issues dating back from 2002 and 2004, favorably resolved those. Again, I don't anticipate those on a go-forward basis, so some of the items that we're benefiting with the tax rate in '10, I don't expect to continue into 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Our focus on APAC, I know at the Analyst Day, [indiscernible], if I'm saying her name properly, had spoken out quickly about your initiatives in APAC. The China numbers were kind of consistent with what we have thought, but the overall number was higher. You alluded to Philippines and Australia. How much more do you have to go to fill the bucket in Philippines and Australia? Could those regions potentially fuel growth in APAC going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "James, this is Hikmet. APAC has been, for us, always an opportunity market. If you look at our portfolio, only a small part of our portfolio is currently APAC. And we have strong growth rates in APAC. Also, the market in Philippines are doing well and also market like Australia is growing. But I believe there are also markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, where we have opportunities. And recently, as we announced last quarter, we opened in Japan also. That's also an opportunity. Also we are expanding our network there. In some markets, we have high brand awareness. In some markets, we are building the brand name, and it's a market that we are investing. The interesting thing on APAC is there's also not only an inbound opportunity like in the Philippines or China, but we also see intra-region within APAC: outbound and corridor building, inbound and outbound activities. And the other example is the Philippines' intra-money transfer market, I think, we are very well positioned there. In Australia, we have strong growth there. And we also see these opportunities to expanded in Indonesia, Malaysia, also in the intra market. So overall, I would say in APAC, given our 200 countries presence, also APAC, we have rich opportunities here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just on the Global Business Payments operating margin, that one came in a little bit below what we were expecting. Can you talk about what the outlook is there? And I know at the Analyst Day, you guys were talking about trying to do some quick fixes there. Maybe you can give us some color on how you guys plan to fix the operating margin.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, on that business, Bryan, one of our challenges, and if you exclude Custom House, is the revenues declining from the U.S. Bill Payment business. So one thing we've done is combine that business with the Americas under Stewart Stockdale's leadership. And our thinking there, strategic thinking there is to really to continue to try and drive new sales and new business. It take sometime to sell, it takes sometime for that business to convert, but we've got to push hard on the top line to get that top line going north and not south, if you will. But also equally important is looking at operating efficiencies or synergies and combining, if you will, those two organizations. So we create better leverage as we move forward. And I'll just say, broadly to just, Banco Brasil is doing well. It's a smaller piece of the business. But what's important for our business model in that area is product diversification, geographic diversification, and Custom House will play an element of that. Custom House is only in seven countries today, but broader, we have an opportunity to expand Custom House further not only deepen the penetration in the existing seven countries, but move to additional countries. So that will help that segment business broadly as we move forward, too.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Bryan, let me just say on the U.S. Bill Payment, my team is focused in their operational fix that's parts of the business. As Scott said, we do have some top line issues, but we are expanding the portfolio to get more revenues. But also on the parts of the business, we are really looking in the very deep side [ph] there and we are very focused on that, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then my follow-up is, Scott, the raise in EPS, how much of that was the better operating margin versus lower tax rate?", "Scott Scheirman", "Bryan, are you referring to the third quarter or the full year?", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess for the full year, just to take up a guidance.", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure. It's a combination of several things. Let me walk you through those, Bryan. It's clearly, we've got revenue at the upper end of our constant currency, so we've got some revenue help that's pulling through the bottom line or EPS. So that's definitely a factor. And it's also the tax rate, the simple math on the tax rate if you do it, it's about $0.02. But then I'd say that's also offset by some investment spending we're making in the fourth quarter. So we're investing some more in the fourth quarter behind marketing and some other strategic initiatives. So there's investment there that we used to fund some growth things that will help us in the fourth quarter and 2011. So really the combination of revenue at the top and the constant currency outlook we've had, somewhat from the tax rate and then some offset from more investment spending in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Scott, I just wanted to come back to the comment that you made about the $5 price point not likely to go away. At least, I didn't catch if that was a one or two quarter event. Can you just give us some clarity on what you mean by that? And is that necessary, I guess, to sustain the recent improvements in the Americas transaction volume growth? And for how long should we expect that price point to be in place?", "Scott Scheirman", "Right now, we see the domestic business as a growth business. We think one element of that is the $5 for $50 price point, but also it's broader with the repositioning that we've done with that with simplified pricing. We've got a good message there. And the $5 for $50 is bringing customers back to the company that we haven't seen and also some new customers in there. So we think we believe that's going to be part of our go-forward strategy, it's to offer that $5 for $50. We think that's important. I think what's equally important to think about is that for the quarter, we had 35% transaction growth, 35% transaction growth. Revenue was down only 6%. And the reason I say this is that it moderated from being down 20% in the fourth quarter about a year ago, so it's really moderating. By the fourth quarter, we expect positive revenue growth. And that's a business that carries 30% margins. So we feel like we've got a very good formula in that business to drive growth as we move forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Frisch of Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Hikmet, you're getting off to a really good start on the C2C performance here. Are you seeing anything in the market today which would give you any concerns about the growth and margin expansion continuing? And then the follow-up would be how dependent are your goals for C2C margin growth dependent on the economy?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Adam, first of all, the beauty of our business being in 200 countries, right, we do see opportunities globally where we are present, but we do see also some challenges on the employment rate on the parts of the economy, parts of the world is still high. And Gulf states has still challenging [indiscernible], and parts of like Spain has still 20% unemployment rate. So the beauty of our business is that we have been in 200 countries, right. So we do like Russia, Germany, U.K., [indiscernible] but the U.S. business is doing well. Americas region had another solid quarter. So I would say that really we have the luxury of the portfolio to respond to the market challenges and the opportunities. I would say also we are working very well positioned once the economy really picks up, right? We've been here. We are very well positioned. We are here. We have our 450,000 locations. We have our brand. As I mentioned in the Investor Conference, we have our strong fundamentals to expand even to the other channels also, right, so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of UBS.", "Jason Kupferberg - UBS Investment Bank", "I just wanted to follow up on some of the margin commentary, obviously, everyone is thinking about where the '11 margins might fall out. And you guys have been pretty consistent in your commitment to expanding margins over time. And I know you can't give us any specifics yet in terms of guidance there. But can you help us understand at least the relative importance of some of the relevant factors that are going to impact margins next year? I'm thinking about all the variables like revenue growth and pricing, reinvestments in the business, maybe some initial restructuring savings. Just some qualitative commentary on kind of the relative importance of each of those factors as we start to think about conceptually where margins could shake out next year.", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure, Jason. Let me walk you through some factors to think about. Again, it's too early to get to your point, 2011 guidance or outlook. But if you start very macro, we do believe we've got a business model that can drive margin expansion as revenue accelerate. So probably one of the key things is the top line revenue for 2011 as we think about that. Clearly, we've done some things, productivity [ph] have been a little bit helpful. The May restructuring we announced will have about $30 million to $40 million of savings next year. We continue to move forward with our commission optimization initiatives and so forth. But again, we want to balance that with making the right investments in the business. And those investments would be strategically aligned to really drive the retail expansion, drive electronic expansion, rounding out our product portfolio with Prepaid and Business Solutions. So we'll continue to invest in the businesses as we move forward. But as a leadership team, we are committed to driving margin expansion. We'll balance that with investments. And probably the macro thing that will be the most helpful or could be a challenge, as Hikmet alluded to, is the global operating environment and what the top line revenue growth looks like as we move forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Grant [indiscernible] for Kartik, I realize you don't want to give guidance for 2011. But just directionally just to make sense, assuming the economy doesn't deteriorate in 2011 and you witness revenue growth, any reason to think the operating margin does not improve?", "Scott Scheirman", "Again, it's too early to get into 2011 in specifics. And we could play a lot of scenarios, and I don't want to go through a lot of scenarios here. But Clearly, the leadership team, if I can just emphasize, we're very focused on gaining share. We believe the secular trends are intact. We want to drive the top line, drive productivity and balance that with investments for the right long-term growth of the business. But as a leadership team, one of our objectives over the long term is we want to expand the margins.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think if you look at our strategies back in Australia, they're built on that. The first three parts are driving the top line revenue, finding a new segment and the last one is the improving our process and productivity. I think our business model more than stretches the line to expand our margins, right?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Is there any increased competition in the EMEASA region just based on the transaction growth and revenue decline in the third quarter?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think there is nothing surprising since last quarter, right? So I think competition has been always there, but we are gaining market share. I mean, globally, if you look at our market share, again, we have some challenges in some countries, like countries in the EMEASA region, like Germany, like U.K. Russia are performing well. And the EMEASA region, we have challenges on the Gulf states. And that continued, but it's more economic-related challenges than competition-related challenges, I guess.", "Scott Scheirman", "Grant, the revenue decline was really just due to currency translation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets", "I know one of the big issues around the stock has been concern over competition, and I think you did a great job at the Investor Day addressing your competitive position. There have been a couple of competitive announcements or maybe the flushing out of some competitive positions in the last week or so, and I wondered if I might ask you about them. One would be, PayPal's efforts to market an account-to-cash solution for banks and really speeding up the settlement times, which have been, what, I think, Paypal's competitive disadvantage historically, among others. And I find it curious that they're trying to partner with banks whereas there is also a competitive issue that banks have with PayPal for sure in terms of producing interchange. And I just wondered if you could give an update on your efforts to increase account-to-cash? At U.S. banks, obviously, you had some winds of late, but maybe talk about it in a competitive context. I mean, Chase has offered or introduced a B2B solution similar to Custom House solutions in certain markets, I wonder if you could sort of address your competitive position against both of those products?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Let me address that. I believe that we are very well positioned for expanding our portfolio in the account-to-cash, cash-to-account money transfer. The reason for that is we can pay out in minutes cash, right, or collect cash and pay out in an account to minutes cash in that 16,000 corridors. Currently, we have 27 banks internationally [indiscernible]. Also globally, we about 27 banks, which allows us to do account-based money transfer. We are growing about 50%. And so what we're are doing is really connecting the accounts with the cash payout with our locations, which gives us an edge, competitive advantage, I guess. The other thing also is that on the B2B money transfer, I think with the Custom House acquisition, we started seeing an opportunity here that we can serve also small business entities globally. Currently, we are have Custom House in seven countries. And given our global brand and global presence, global network, global agent relationship we have, we believe that we could service SMBs globally and the bigger market. That's why we are also changing the Custom House now to Western Union Business solutions and promoting that within the SMBs and expanding with our -- longer-term, expanding that business globally.", "Scott Scheirman", "This is Scott. The one thing I would add there with Custom House or Business solutions is that our market share there is very, very small. So for us, the game is market share gain. Customers have been underserved by banks, and so we think we can compete well in that space as we move forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "The marketing spend, the 5% spend in the fourth quarter, is that higher than what you budgeted at this time last quarter? And I'm curious if this is just more of a one-off investment around the holidays or if it's more of a permanent kind of spend?", "Hikmet Ersek", "This as Hikmet. I mean, first of all, as you know, we do marketing depending on seasonality, depending on opportunities, depending on corridor opportunities. Globally, we allocate the marketing. Definitely, we see some opportunities part of [ph] the core business to invest in the marketing in the fourth quarter, which we believe, is the right investment. Also some parts of the investment is also about our new initiatives, right? I think what we do is we are really diversifying our marketing investment against the opportunities, and we do see opportunities in Q4 and into several countries. And traditionally, I believe we've been over 4% [indiscernible], I think.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, I mean, and just macro -- on an annual basis for us, two or three years, we've been around 4% to 6%. It'll vary quarter-by-quarter. As we spoke about earlier, we're a little bit below 4% the first three quarters. We'll be closer to 5%. But we just see an opportunity to make some investments behind the holidays, behind some of the loyalty programs that we think will not only have some benefits in the fourth quarter, but as important or more important, they have more benefits for us in 2011. So we make sure it's the right investment.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I think, Scott, you went through some of the spread discussion. Can you give us an idea, and maybe you gave this or not, what the normalized spread between revenue and transaction growth would look like domestically now that we're going to, we've lapped the October repositioning? Because I think that could drive some confusion as we see that domestically.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, here is how I think about it, Tien-Tsin. Just to mention, if you will, that there is -- so reminded everybody, there's really two price points we've got to lap in the fourth quarter. The first one is call it October 1 a year ago when we got all the prices uniformity throughout the U.S. And then just a little bit before Thanksgiving, call it November 15, about a year ago, we introduced the $5 for $50 program or promotion, if you will. So we kind of got two sets of pricings to lap, if you will. I think the important thing to think about is that we expect positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We do expect the spread betweens transactions and revenue will narrow somewhat in the fourth quarter, but I think the key element is that it'll be positive through revenue growth with a business that carries the 30% plus margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "First, Hikmet, could you comment on recent trends you've seen in agent productivity and how they might compared to a year ago? These are for new agents.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally, if you look on agent productivity constantly, it's both sides, right? Agent do look at their productivity and getting more transaction in their locations and getting more traffic depending on the agents portfolio. And also from our side, from the commissions side, we also look our agent commissions constantly. Having that global presence, having so many agents, more than 1,000 agents, 900,000 agents, we do look at our agent portfolio, and when the contracts are coming and we renegotiating country-by-country, quarter-by-quarter the agent contracts, and depending on that. So I think we are constantly looking at this as a part of our process and productivity initiative, and so I would say that that's a constant work that we're doing.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Scott, what are your capital allocations priorities for 2011?", "Scott Scheirman", "On a long-term basis, if it's really first, to invest [ph] that in the business, David, which runs 2% to 3% of our revenues, so call it $100 million to $150 million. Second priority is acquisitions, mergers and acquisitions, reinvesting back in the business that way. But they will be selective. It's got to be strategically fit very well, have the right cash and cash economic return. And then third, which is very important, is returning cash to shareholders both through dividends and stock buyback. And we continue to move more towards a balanced approach with -- as we talked about at the Investor Day back in December, we increased the dividend payout last December. So we very much view a balance payout as important as we move forward, too. So those would be the priorities for our capital allocation as we think about the next couple of years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "First question, and a quick follow-up, how much did you spend of investments overall in Custom House, Prepaid and Payment Services Directive so for this year or at least the ballpark amount? Really how much were margins pressure from those and other reinvestments? And then do you see similar amounts going forward next year? I guess really do you expect meaningful revenue generation also from Payment [indiscernible] PSD and Payments Services Directive in Q4 and next year?", "Scott Scheirman", "Darrin, this is Scott. Let me kind of give you a full year view of the investment spending. And we talked earlier in the year about roughly about $50 million that we would spend between, call it, Electronic Channels, PSD, Custom House, all those things. It adds up from about $25 million in 2009. So that was generally ratably and will be ratably spent over the year, over 2010. As we move forward into 2011, again a little early to get specific outlook. But as we think about the business, we're going to continue to invest in the business to drive that growth, but also balance that with a business model that we believe we can drive margin expansion. I mean, expanding the margins is important. So we'll balance all those things as we move forward. On PSD, every quarter, it's contributing more revenue. It's not hugely meaningful in 2010, but we are on track for it to be 1% of revenue in 2011. I think what's important there is we have opportunities in Europe to really expanded the retail class of trade, especially in countries such as Germany, where it's really been dominated by banks or post banks. And just what we've done in the U.S. with retail, we can do that in Europe. We think that's an important initiative over the next two to three years.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "And just to follow up on the PSD side, on the Payment Services Directive, is that higher-margin revenue given versus the super agent kind before, given that you're now with more to the retail channel in Europe?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I mean, what PSD does give us different portfolios, right? We do had some banks and post offices with certain commission rates in the PSD. We do have the license and also certain commission rates. Obviously, we don't disclose commission rates from all the agents. But I think we are constantly looking at our portfolio, where we have the optimal agent relationship and the agent commission rates. But given the -- we are expecting about 1% incremental revenue to PSD next year, so I think it's too small to have a general impact on our numbers currently. But we believe it's a long-term opportunity because it gives the customers longer opening hour, reachable everywhere, so I think we have the right strategy here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "My question was just any comments you might have around the trends you saw during the quarter, just having a chance to review everything a bit more detail. And specifically, is there anything you would note around the Gulf region, which I think was the region that was able to maintain its strength the longest before finally sort of softening up towards the end of last year or early this year? And just sort of lapping those comparisons, any thoughts around that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, let me start, and Scott jump in on that. I think if you look at our business, really, we do see parts of the world improvement and parts of the world still remaining challenging. We do see Gulf states continue to be challenged in that. Obviously the same steady declines as we had in last quarter, but I think we have the right strategy there. We have the right agents there. Once the economy really picks up there, also, the investments picks up there. And different parts of the industry, the construction service, hotel industry, I believe that long term, we have the right strategy. We are in the right place to respond to the challenges also in the Gulf states. You have something?", "Scott Scheirman", "The other thing I would add, Tim, to trends, if you will. Have you think about it from a macro basis? If you think about the third quarter, this is the fourth consecutive quarter in a row where sequentially both C2C transactions and C2C constant-currency revenue have increased. I think everybody knows that C2C is 85% of our revenues. we have 30% margins in the quarter. So clearly, the sequential improvement continues four quarters in a row, and we're pleased with that during the past four quarters.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "But in general, if you sort of have to just sort of think about the franchise, you don't have any major countries or corridors even that were seeing declines accelerate. Maybe sort of the worst case is rates have declined began to stabilize for \"the softer spot\" in the franchise, whereas other parts of the franchise, we've seen that sort of sequential acceleration. Would that be a fair characterization?", "Scott Scheirman", "I'd probably go back to the portfolio approach that we're in 200 countries, right? And if you just take a picture of the International business, it's 70% of our revenue. Those transactions have grown 7% for the last couple of quarters. Constant-currency revenue has grown 4%. The Gulf was soft in Q3, like it was like in Q2, so no dramatic change up or down there. But there are certain countries, such as Russia or Germany. Recall that Australia and Philippines, those growth rates were a little bit better in Q3 than they were in Q2. But it kind of comes back to the portfolio approach of doing business in 200 countries, and it's helpful. But not every country is going to be perfect. But when you're in 200 countries, it's helpful as you move forward.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Just to finish on that probably, we are very focused of executing to finish [indiscernible] maybe. We are very focused on executing against our key strategies. I believe we have the right strategies, right initiatives. We are also pleased with the quarter and build on the fundamentals. We are proud to be very focused against our execution strategy.

As we enter the new year, our focus remains on our key strategic priorities of growing retail channels, expanding electronic channels, developing our product portfolio and improving process and productivity.

For the year, we delivered earnings per share of $1.42, excluding restructuring expenses, and generated $1 billion of cash flow from operations. We also grew our retail net agent network to 445,000 locations and believe we continue to gain cross-border market share. ", "In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 3%, with constant currency revenue growing 5%. Constant currency revenue growth in our Consumer-to-Consumer business improved for the fifth quarter in a row accelerating to a 5% increase. The progress was widespread as revenue growth rates improved in all of our regions compared to the prior quarter. Asia Pacific led the way with 14% revenue growth, but our biggest change came from the Americas. This region delivered 7% revenue growth for the quarter and 2% for the year, following three straight years of declines. Contributing to the growth in the Americas was the turnaround in the U.S. domestic businesses. As we expected, the repositioning, which roll high transaction increases throughout 2010 led the revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, domestic money transfer revenue increased a strong 7%. Our strategy has been very successful, and we believe we have created new demand and attracted new consumers to our brands.", "In Global Business Payments, the bill payment revenue declined moderated slightly compared to the third quarter. We continue to work stabilizing this business through the addition of new billers and the rollout of an improved walk-in payment service. The Custom House business, which we have rebranded Western Union Business Solutions, delivered strong revenue growth, reaching $30 million for the quarter and $111 million for the year. Globally, we have signed several agreements over the past few months that position us well to execute on our key strategies as we move forward in 2011. ", "We will be expanding our retail channels with some of the premier banks in Europe and Russia, including Banca Intesa Sanpaolo and Sberbank and have added several new subagents in India that combined will bring more than 5,000 new locations primarily in the important southern rural region of the country.", "In electronic channels, we now have 40 banks that have agreed to offer account-based money transfer, including our first one in China, Shanghai Pudong Bank. We signed a mobile agreement with MTN that covers 21 countries across Africa and the Middle East.", "We have also begun money transfer services through ATMs in Europe with Banca Transilvania in Romania and Garanti Bank in Turkey with almost 4,000 ATMs active in the region and more on the way. And we have expanded westernunion.com to 20 countries recently adding Denmark, Poland and Finland. ", "In new products and services, we have signed new prepaid card distribution deals such as with income and continue to work on international expansion plans. We have also made good progress in process and productivity. The retraction we announced last May is on track, and we are now anticipating additional opportunities under this program to further streamline our business, which Scott will discuss in a few minutes.", "As we look ahead to 2011, we expect the momentum generated at the end of last year to continue. Although there is still generally high unemployment and challenging economical conditions in some countries, we believe the environment has been stabilizing and anticipate modest improvement in the remittance market in 2011. Overall, we expect 3% to 4% constant currency revenue growth for Western Union in 2011. ", "Our outlook anticipates continued share gains in cross-border remittances from further retail expansion, marketing initiatives and growth in electronic channels. We expect the bill payment business to continue to be challenging but we believe the revenue declines will moderate as we progress through the year. Western Union Business Solutions, which was formerly Custom House is projected to deliver mid-teens revenue growth in 2011 and no longer be dilutive to EPS.", "And our objective with the Prepaid business is to double the cards-in-force. We expect Prepaid revenues to grow to approximately 1% of the total company revenue this year. Our operating margin outlook calls for expansion in 2011. We anticipate revenue growth and savings from restructuring and productivity usage to more than offset investments in the business. We believe we are investing appropriately to drive future growth both from strategic initiatives such as electronic channels, Prepaid and business-to-business payments, as well as our core retail Money Transfer business. ", "Finally, we plan to continue in 2011 with strong cash flow generation and meaningful return to capital to our shareholders. We anticipate generating $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of cash flow from operating activities this year. During 2010, we returned $750 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends, and we will be active in 2011. Today, we are announcing a new $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, and in December, our board increased the quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.07 per share.", "As I have mentioned in the past, I believe we have the right strategies in place and our success will depend largely on execution. Our strategic priorities of growing retail channels, expanding electronic channels, developing our product portfolio and improving process and productivity present us many opportunities. ", "Our priority to grow retail channel is driven by positive long-term demographic trends that should support migrant flows and remittance growth over time. The need for cash in much of the developed world is still critical, and we believe we can gain share through expanding our network, marketing our brand and complementing our physical network with electronic channels. We now have almost 60 million loyalty cards, and in 2011, we plan to increase our retail network by another 30,000 to 40,000 agent locations.", "Our second strategic priority is expanding electronic channels. There are many emerging competitors in electronic channels, but none can match the combination we offer with our agent network, brand, compliance capabilities and scale. Our development of westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile money transfer not only allows us to offer more choice to consumers but also reach new consumers who already utilize account-based methods. ", "Our third strategic priority is developing our product portfolio. You can utilize our agent network, brand and consumer business relationship to enter new areas. With prepaid cards, we are offering an additional service to new and existing consumers in a fast-growing global market. With Western Union Business Solutions, we are entering a large fragmented market by serving the underserved, in this case small and medium-sized enterprises that have cross-border payment needs. ", "Our final priority is to improve process and productivity. We believe there are many opportunities to create a faster-moving, more efficient organization that can generate long-term margin expansion. The restructuring activities we have undertaken to drive efficiencies are one example, and I am committed to driving continuous improvement. So we are confident in our strategies. With the improvement in our business in the fourth quarter, the many new agreements in place and the advances we are making in our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to drive execution and growth.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the 2011 outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2010 revenue results, I will primarily focus on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. ", "Overall, for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue growth of 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Total Western Union transaction fee revenue represented 78% of total company revenue for the quarter and increased 2% from the prior year. Foreign exchange revenue represented 20% of total company revenue and increased 7% from the prior year. Our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue growth rate accelerated from prior quarters, posting an increase of 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Each region contributed to improved trends although currency translation continued to negatively affect Europe. ", "Transaction growth in our C2C segment for the quarter was 9%. Trends in the international C2C business improved from the third quarter as revenue grew 3% or 5% on constant currency basis on transaction growth of 8%. The company's C2C cross-border principal increased 6% in the quarter or 7% on a constant currency basis. C2C principal per transaction decreased 3% year-over-year or declined 1% on a constant currency basis.", "Turning to our regions. Our C2C business in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew transactions of 6%, up from the 5% growth in the third quarter. Revenue declined 1% and was again negatively impacted by currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EMEASA revenue increased in the quarter. Large markets such as the U.K., Germany and Russia continue to deliver solid constant currency revenue growth, but the real change came from some improvements in areas that were challenged the last few quarters such as the Gulf States. After a couple of quarters of declines, the Gulf States returned to transaction and revenue growth in the fourth quarter. India also contributed to the quarterly improvement with transaction growth of 6% and a revenue increase of 8%.", "As we announced at the end of the year, we have agreed to acquire the remaining 70% interest in one of our leading super agents in Europe, Angelo Costa. This acquisition will allow us to more directly access our network locations and be closer to our consumers, as well as more quickly introduce new products and services such as prepaid cards. From a cost standpoint, we will be able to optimize commission levels, and as a result of combining Angelo Costa with the business we acquired to the FEXCO acquisition in 2009, we expect to realize efficiencies and economies of scale over time. For the full year, the EMEASA operating margin was 28%, an increase of 10 basis points from 2009.", "Turning to the Americas region. The U.S. domestic repositioning helped drive improved revenue growth in the quarter. Overall, the Americas region delivered a revenue increased of 7% on transaction growth of 11%. Domestic money transfer delivered a strong 7% revenue growth in the quarter as we reach the anniversary of last year's repositioning. Domestic transaction growth continued as well, with an increase of 29% in the quarter. We believe the repositioning has been driving new business to our network, and we expect continued revenue growth in 2011. Elsewhere in the region, Mexico transactions and revenue each grew 3% in the quarter, and the U.S. Outbound business continued to perform well. For the year, the Americas' operating margin was 28%, a 200 basis point increase from 2009.", "The Asia-Pacific region continued its strong performance with growth of 14% in both transactions and revenue in the quarter. Many countries across Asia Pacific are performing well, including the Philippines and Australia. We're also off to a good start in developing our business in Japan. In China, transactions grew 7% and revenue increased 6%. The Asia Pacific operating margin for 2010 was 29%, an increase of 210 basis points from 2009. ", "For the overall C2C business, the spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was four percentage points, excluding the impact of currency, which had a negative two point impact. The spread narrowed from previous quarters, primarily due to the anniversary of the price changes in domestic money transfer.", "If you recall, we initially repositioned the business at the beginning of the fourth quarter in 2009 and with the $50 for $5 segment enacted in mid-November of that year. The pricing impact on the spread in the fourth quarter was only 2% due to the anniversary of the domestic changes. Full year C2C pricing impact was 4%. This year, we'll adjust our pricing reporting to more precisely differentiate pricing and mix, using prior year transaction volumes as a basis for the pricing calculation rather than current year transaction volumes. Under the new definition, our pricing impact in 2009 would've been 3%. In 2011, we expect pricing reductions to be approximately 2% to 3%.", "Moving to Global Business Payments segment. Overall, revenue was flat. The Bill Payment business decline moderated slightly with a decrease of 5%, again due to the U.S. market. Western Union Business Solutions revenues were $30 million in the quarter, up from $23 million in 2009. In the U.S. Bill Payment business, we continue to roll out our walk-in bill payment platform. The new enhanced service will simplify branding and product positioning, improve the consumer experience and give us the flexibility to implement more dynamic pricing models for the Bill Payment business. ", "Before we move onto margins, I want to give a brief update on our progress and metrics in electronic channels and Prepaid. In the fourth quarter, our westernunion.com transactions in international markets increased 50%. Including the U.S., globally westernunion.com increased transactions by over 20%. We added three new country transaction sites in the quarter, raising our total to 20 countries around the world. Account-based money transfer transactions, which includes cash to accounts and accounts with cash through banks increased over 40% in the quarter. We now have 40 banks that have agreed to offer this service.", "In mobile money transfer, we have 12 agreements in place with mobile network operators and banks, and we have also enabled over 80,000 of our agent locations in 48 countries to be able to provide cash to mobile service. In total, electronic channels represented 2% of total company revenues for both the quarter and the year. ", "In Prepaid, we increased our cards-in-force in the U.S. to 890,000 with retail distribution at nearly 9,500 locations. For the year, over $350 million of principal was loaded on to the Western Union Prepaid cards through 1.5 million loans. Our Prepaid revenue in 2010 was not material and mainly driven by third-party top-ups. In 2011, we should start to see the early results of the CCH tax refund card offering as well as benefit from the income distribution. Internationally, our Prepaid group has been working with multiple country teams around the world to prepare for Prepaid launches.", "Turning to margins. Fourth quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 24%. Excluding restructuring charges, the consolidated operating margin was 25%. The fourth quarter operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, improved approximately 30 basis points from the same period last year. Excluding restructuring, the operating margin declined relative to the third quarter of 2010 due to planned increases in marketing and investment spending as we discussed in the third quarter call. We recorded $11 million of restructuring charges in the quarter related to our May 27 announcement. Approximately $1 million of the charges included in cost of services and $10 million is in SG&A. These charges are not included in our segment operating results. Our full year 2010 GAAP operating margin was 25% or 26%, excluding the restructuring charges. ", "Full year operating income margins, excluding 2010 restructuring charges and the 2009 settlement accrual, declined approximately 40 basis points compared to last year. Increased investment and acquisition amortization were the main drivers, partially offset by lower marketing spending and operating efficiencies.", "For the year, we recorded $60 million in restructuring charges, with $15 million in cost of services and $45 million in SG&A. In December of this year, we received the final settlement of our claim with the Reserve International Liquidity Fund. We received a cash payment of $37 million, which resulted in a $6 million benefit in the other income expense line in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter tax rate benefited from favorable cumulative adjustments. Consequently, we reported a tax rate of 16% for the quarter and 21% for the year, which compared to 25% for the 2009 full year.", "The 2010 full year tax rate was favorably impacted by the increasing proportion of profits being foreign-derived, the cumulative positive tax benefit of previous foreign acquisitions and tax planning and IRS settlements relating to prior years. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.37 or $0.38, excluding restructuring charges. On a constant currency basis, EPS was also $0.38, excluding restructuring. This compares to GAAP EPS of $0.32 in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Our C2C segment operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27%, an increase of 130 basis points over the same period last year. The full year C2C operating margin was 28%, which represented 110 basis point improvement over 2009. The fourth quarter margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and lower marketing spending while the full year improvement was primarily due to lower marketing spending. ", "Global Business Payments' operating margin was 13% in the fourth quarter, which compared to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The margin declined compared to last year, primarily due to the revenue decline in mix shifts in U.S. Bill Payments, as well as higher investment in Western Union Business Solutions, which was formerly Custom House. Margin declines compared to the third quarter relate primarily to the Bill Payment revenue and mix changes.", "Excluding Business Solutions, operating margin was 21% in the fourth quarter of 2010, which compared to 26% in the prior year. For the full year, Global Business Payments' operating margins were 17%. As expected, Western Union Business Solutions contributed an operating loss due to the integration expenses, intangibles or amortization and investment spending for future growth. We expect this business to be non-dilutive in 2011. Excluding Business Solutions, full year operating margins were 24%, which compared to 27% in 2009 and were negatively impacted by the decline in the U.S. Bill Payment revenue and mix of business.", "Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong. In 2010, cash flow from operations was $994 million and included the impact of a $250 million refundable tax deposit that we made with the IRS in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the year and $26 million in the fourth quarter. At year end, the company had total debt of $3.3 billion and cash of $2.2 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion was outside the United States. ", "During 2010, we spent $584 million to repurchase nearly 36 million shares or 5% of the total shares outstanding at an average price of $16.44. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares at an average price of $18.15 per share for a total of $70 million.", "As of December 31, we have $416 million remaining under the previous stock repurchase authorization, which is incremental to the $1 billion authorization that was announced today. Both authorizations expire on December 31, 2012. In December, we also raised our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.07 per share, and during 2010, we paid a total of $165 million in dividends. ", "Turning to our full year 2011 outlook. We expect the momentum we realized in the fourth quarter to continue. We would characterize the overall economic environment as stable with economic challenges in some parts of the world and continued high unemployment levels. We anticipate modest improvement in the global remittance market. Our outlook projects stronger Consumer-to-Consumer revenue growth, moderating Bill Payment declines and midteens revenue growth from Western Union Business Solutions. Electronic channels are projected to grow to 3% of total company revenue, and Prepaid, including third-party top-up is expected to reach approximately 1% of revenue. Overall, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the year. Based on recent exchange rates, we expect GAAP revenue to be similar to constant currency.", "Operating income margins are projected to expand in 2011 to approximately 27%, excluding restructuring charges, which compares to 26% in 2010. From a GAAP standpoint, we project operating margins of approximately 26% compared to 25% in 2010. Revenue leverage, restructuring savings and other operating efficiencies are expected to more than offset investments in strategic initiatives and fixed cost inflation. ", "As our strategic initiatives become more combined with our other businesses, we will no longer plan to break out specific investment dollars, but as a frame of reference, we are increasing investment spending compared to 2010. We are projecting 2011 marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to be similar to 2010 levels at around 4%.", "We anticipate recording approximately $50 million of pretax restructuring charges in 2011, which represents an impact on GAAP EPS of $0.06. As you recall, in May of last year, we announced a multi-phase global initiative to simplify business processes with the decision-making closer to the marketplace and leverage our cost structure. At that time, we anticipate recording approximately $80 million of restructuring charges over 18 months, and in 2010, we recorded $60 million of these charges. ", "After further analysis of our organization design opportunities, we're now expecting the total charges and related savings to be higher than originally projected. Our 2011 outlook includes anticipated pretax savings from restructuring actions of approximately $50 million, which compares to $8 million of total savings achieved in 2010. Beginning in 2012, we now expect annualized savings of $70 million from the restructuring initiatives.", "Currency is expected to negatively impact 2011 earnings per share by approximately $0.02. Due to differences in foreign exchange hedge rates in 2011 compared to 2010. To give you an idea of sensitivity of the future foreign exchange rate movements, based on our current hedge position, a 5% move in the European currencies would impact revenue by approximately $55 million and pretax operating income by around $7 million on a full year basis. ", "Our outlook also includes a net $0.01 benefit to EPS from the Angelo Costa acquisition, which is expected to close in the first half of the year. The acquisition impact is a result of the gain anticipated to be recorded on Western Union's previous 30% equity ownership position in Angelo Costa, partially offset by slight dilution from integration costs. ", "We anticipate our tax rate to be higher in 2011 as we had various benefits in 2010 from cumulative adjustments and favorable resolutions. We currently project our GAAP tax rate at approximately 24% to 25% for 2011 versus 21% in 2010, which results in a negative impact to EPS of $0.06 to $0.08 in 2011 compared to 2010. We believe future year tax rates should continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being derived outside the U.S. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to continue to be around 2% to 3% of revenue. ", "Given all these factors, our outlook for 2011 is constant currency revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%; GAAP revenue growth similar to constant currency; GAAP operating margin expansion to approximately 26% in 2011 compared to 25% in 2010; operating margin expansion to approximately 27% in 2011, excluding restructuring charges compared to 26% in 2010; GAAP EPS of $1.41 to $1.46, including $0.06 of restructuring charges; EPS of $1.47 to $1.52, excluding restructuring charges; and GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. ", "In summary, we are pleased with the improving trends in our business and the progress we are making on our strategic priorities. We finished 2010 on a positive note, and our 2011 outlook balances growth, margin expansion and strong capital deployment for shareholders with appropriate investments for the future. ", "I would now like to turn the call back to Mike for Q&A.", "Michael Salop", "Thanks, Scott. Once again, in order to maximize the number of people we can get on the call and still finish within an hour, we would ask you to limit yourself to one question per person. Melanie, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to focus on C2C for a second and the operating margin that you guys are targeting for C2C in 2011 and also provide some detail on the contributions from revenue growth and what went into those assumptions? I know it's about 84% or so of total revs, so your guidance there was kind of in-line with consensus. I just want to see what your assumptions were there to gauge how conservative that may prove and then the expense reduction as well?", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure, Adam, good afternoon. This is Scott. We're pleased with the C2C business. As you mentioned, it's about 85% of our revenue, and in 2011, we expect our margins to expand consolidated from -- roughly by a little bit less than 100 basis points, excluding the restructuring charges. A fair amount of that will come from the C2C business. We expect the revenue to grow quicker in 2011 than 2010 in the C2C business, and we see strength in various pockets around the globe, some challenges in some other areas, but overall, we expect both the margin for the company and the margin for C2C to expand in 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I'm glad to see the margin expansion. I'll ask about revenue. I was curious about the Gulf States or the Middle East, given all the turmoil there in Egypt. Can you share with us your revenue exposure to Egypt and what your 2011 outlook assumes and if it contemplates a pretty bad case in the region if that plays out?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's Hikmet. As everybody, we are also worried with what happens in Middle East, but if you look at our portfolio in 200 countries and none of the countries are outside the U.S., we are bigger than 6% of our revenue, no country is bigger than that. And particularly in Egypt, it's less than 1% of our revenue. So being in 200 countries and territories gives us the opportunity to have the right balance against the risks and opportunities. We are of course watching it, the Middle East, very carefully currently and about our transaction, we are pleased with our transaction growth in Q4 within the Gulf States. We see slight improvements there, and that has also impacted the South Asia corridors. So currently we are watching Egypt, as I said, and as I said, it's less than 1% of our revenues. So that's the case currently.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess my question is on constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, I think it was 5%, but you guys are guiding to 3% to 4% for the year. Is that just you guys being conservative? And if I can sneak in a second one, just on Bill Payment margins. Obviously, that still seems to be impacted. What's the outlook there to rightsizing that business to fix the Bill Payment margins?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Bryan, it's Hikmet. Maybe I'll start and Scott take it probably. If you look at our business in 2010, Bryan, we had a good quarter in 2010 fourth quarter. But overall, constant currency x Custom House, we had a 1% revenue growth. And coming to 3% to 4% overall 2011 revenue growth, I believe it's a good revenue growth, and we are quite confident that we have forecasted a good revenue growth here. And the transactions are coming, so we are cautiously optimistic on the economic environment, but I believe that 3% to 4% for 2011 is a good revenue growth. Do you want to add something Scott?", "Scott Scheirman", "No, I'd just comment, to the second part of your question on the Global Business Payment segments, things that will be helpful to improve those margins as we move in into 2011 is that the Business Solutions, which was formerly Custom House business, we expect that revenue to grow in midteens. We'll see nice top line growth there and that business will no longer be dilutive, so that will be helpful to the margin profile. In addition, the U.S. Bill Payment business we expect the revenue declines to moderate, and then we've got a number of process improvement or productivity initiatives. So our objective with the Global Business Payments is to really if you will stay below those margins and really look towards slightly improving those margins compared to the fourth quarter levels as we move forward, but we're very focused -- Hikmet and I and the team are very focused on that business and making improvements to that segment, in particular the U.S. Bill Payment business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Kissane with BAML.[BofA Merrill Lynch]", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Scott, can you review the change in the pricing definition? Maybe give us a little more color on pricing across the different corridors? And should we assume pricing is flat in the United States in 2011?", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure, Jim. Pricing, as we think about forward-looking, we're somewhere in that range of 2% to 3%. If I compare that back to 2010, clearly, one of the bigger pricing actions we did was with domestic Money Transfer, really, if you will, throw that pricing impact to 4%, but we're really pleased with that because we've got 7% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and that's a business that's got 30% plus margins. As we thought about how to best articulate and communicate pricing with our investors, we think one of the key things is a better measurement as we look forward is to really take any change in revenue per transaction because of pricing and really compare that to the prior year volumes compared to the current year volumes just to better offset or better balance what the pricing impact is in the mix. But as we look forward in 2011, we do think the pricing will be in the range of 2% to 3%, a little bit less than we saw in 2010. And then in the U.S., we think we are well positioned there, never say never but don't contemplate any pricing changes there of any significance, and then we do manage 16,000 corridors, so we'll look corridor by corridor, and as it makes sense, we may make some pricing adjustments all in the effort to drive long-term revenue growth and market share.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "A quick question on some of the emerging payments trends. On prepaid debit cards first, you reached 890,000 by year end, and I think you talked about 1% of revenue being from Prepaid, so what kind of growth in cards is that in '11? What is the expected margin on that? And then also, around the mobile money transfer side, your discussions have been more around a lot of the international operations and some successes there. Have you been in any discussions around the U.S. mobile money launching platforms that we've heard discussed?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Darrin, it's Hikmet. Let me start with the Prepaid side and then a little bit on the mobile. On the Prepaid side, it's in early stages. We are pretty pleased with our expansion on that 890,000 cards-in-force. We have 9,600 active locations. We start selling the direct marketing on that also to issue new cards. We recently signed an income agreement with an income, which gives us the capability to expands the number of locations to sell the cards. It will take some time to expand. We are looking also on the expansion out of the U.S. I believe that's a huge opportunity also given our brand, global brand, global network, agent relationship. We believe that we have also learnings from the U.S. can expand and launch in new countries. But it will take some times on that part. We believe that with the top-up, we assume that the additional incremental 1% of the revenue will come from the Prepaid. And on the mobile side, it's really also long-term opportunity as the emerging part of our business, but we have about 80,000 locations activated globally to send money from 48 countries, and we have agreement with 14 mobile operators. I think we are in a very good position here also. The big advantage we have despite the others is that that we have one brand one global network, which connects the dots, and we have the cash availability to pay in 450,000 locations and pay out in 450,000 locations. So I think we are very well positioned to get that. We also look, of course, also the possibility to expand our mobile opportunities on the U.S.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Hikmet and Scott. Based on your cash flow forecast and 2% to 3% of revenue being CapEx and dividend is somewhere about $188 million. It looks like you'll have free cash flow somewhere between $862 million and $1.01 billion. So what do you intend to do with all that cash?", "Scott Scheirman", "David, a couple of things. First is to invest in the business. As you summarized, CapEx will be $100 million, $150 million. Our second priority is to really invest in the business through mergers and acquisitions. We announced the Angelo Costa deal about a month ago that will be a good use of our international cash. All the time we're looking at other things out there so we want to look to acquire companies but that kind of go well with our strategy and have the right cash-on-cash economic return. And then from there, really returning cash to our shareholders. As we announced today, another $1 billion of stock buybacks. We've got about $1.4 billion through the end of 2012. Back in December, we moved to a more balanced payout on our dividend. Our Board increased that by 17%, and so as we look forward, we'll prioritize our cash that way. Probably one important thing to remind everyone too is that about half of our cash flows are U.S. About half of our cash flows are international, so we'll prioritize those as we need to move forward. But we're in the fortunate position of generating $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of cash. Then they really allow us to drive and execute our strategies and return the capital to shareholders.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Maybe I'll just add on that, David, is also our M&A strategy or using the cash for M&A is aligned with our strategy. I mean as you heard recently from the Costa acquisition, it's supporting our core business but we are also looking on the merging side, merging new opportunities on the M&A side. So I think we have the fortunate position to have the cash to be active on the market also, but it has to be aligned, as Scott said, with our business and it has to be closer to our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I just wanted to circle back on the target margins for the Global Business Payments. So when you talked a lot about the initiatives and the things that you're doing to try and sort out the improvements in the Global Business segments, but when it's all said and done, from the 13% level or so that we're looking at coming out of this quarter, where do you guys actually expect that margin to sort of shake out? What levels do you think it can actually get back to as we go forward from here?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, this is Scott. For sure, we expect it to be a much better than the 13% that we reported in the fourth quarter. Custom House not being dilutive will be helpful as we implement our productivity initiatives that those will be helpful. So I would say we're very focused on that business getting the revenue to go north, improving those margins but I'd say just going back to the overall consolidated business of portfolio of products and services and channels that we want to improve the margins by a little bit less than 100 basis points in 2011. So it'll be a combination of all those things both the U.S. Bill Payment and the C2C business to drive that margin expansion but at the same time making sure we got the right investments in the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet and Scott, in the past you've talked about PSD having a positive impact on revenue growth, and I'm wondering if you could discuss maybe what impact do you anticipate it having on 2011, and if it hasn't yet, when you might expect that impact to continue? And just to follow on to Europe is, maybe where in Europe you might be seeing pricing pressure as transactions grew faster than obviously revenue?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, first of all, let me start with the PSD part. I think we are pleased with the team and I'm pleased with the development of the PSD sector. We have about activated 2,000 locations in Europe with the PSD. A good thing also is that half of that is about independent locations, like ethnic locations we in the past had a limited access in Europe with that. So that gives us the opportunity. If you target the flat 1% incremental revenue coming into 2011 by PSD initiatives to incremental to total revenue generated by the PSD. So we are pretty well underway on the PSD and we have a kind of list to activate -- we signed some agreement to activate the location. It takes some time to activate the locations. As you can recall, there are some big retailers. There are some big service chains to activate them, to connect them and activate the point of sale. It can take some time. On the second question was...", "Scott Scheirman", "Kartik, on your second question, the transaction revenue spread within Europe and so forth, one thing I'd point out is that the Euro currency continues to negatively impact revenue out of Europe. So if you exclude the impact of currency, the revenue growth in Europe in that division was actually positive in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "So my question is on margin improvement for 2011. Is it possible to break out sort of the impact of scale versus restructuring versus other things that you're doing on the margin? And then second question is how much of the buyback is assumed in guidance? Should we sort of do it creatively and say $700 million per year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think we are very focused on margin expense. As I mentioned at about a few months ago at our Investors Relationship Meeting we had in New York, our priorities are process and productivity. What we put is kind of a strategic process and productivity priority here. We have a methods to go after the margin expansion and optimizing our processes and very focus on productivity. Besides that, I believe also we have the right tools on the market. We have the right agent agreement, which helps our margin expansion.", "Scott Scheirman", "What I would add to the margin expansion, just to bring out the specifics, Ashwin, but it is driven from a combination of several things, which is good, which means it's diverse, but revenue growth will be helpful. We'll continue to optimize our commissions, as Hikmet mentioned, improvements in process and productivity and somewhat offsetting that are some investments in the business that are important for the long-term growth and health of the business. On the stock buyback, yes, our outlook does assume some level of stock buyback. I don't necessarily have a specific target I want to share, and the reason is it's important to have flexibility. As the year goes by, we'll prioritize our cash flows accordingly to have the best return to our investors of how we invest or utilize those cash flows. But I will say that we plan to be active. We were active in 2010. We bought back nearly $600 million of stock, and we have a $1.4 billion authorization for the roughly for the next two years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "If we go back, and I know it seems like forever ago but before the recession, you guys had discussed global price stabilization, and I was wondering if you think there's a chance we might see that again over the next few years or we are in a terminal price decline of 2% to 3% per year basically for the foreseeable future?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Craig, this is Hikmet. If we look at your business with the global expansion, we are reaching our 16,000 corridors. We are in 200 countries, and we are really managing our pricing based on the voice of the customers. We have 16,000 corridors. We have 200 countries. Within the corridors, we have different brands, which we manage the pricing. So I think the 2% to 3% of pricing decline wasn't traditional where we forecast for 2011, and the biggest price investment we had was last year in the U.S. with our DMT turnaround. And as you know that it has been a very successful action year and promotion that we gained, not only turned around the business, but we also gained new customers with our $5 for $50 attracting new band. So I think we see the pricing investments more from promotional marketing idea and to getting new customers, winning on the corridors. And if you look at our strategy, obviously, the customers are reacting pretty well. We are gaining market share. We believe that we gained again market share in 2010 and we expand our business. So on the pricing, I would say that's our strategy and it works pretty well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I wanted to ask about -- as we try and project your margins in 2011 and potentially beyond, I wanted to ask what was new in your commentary regarding the savings? And you said $8 million in 2010, $50 million in 2011. I don't recall what you had said previously if anything about 2012. Is that $70 million a new number as we try and project your margins going forward?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, James. That is a new number. Our prior communication was we expected roughly about $50 million in 2012. In the last month or so, we've identified some additional opportunities to streamline the organization, further leverage our global operating centers, and because of that, we now expect about $70 million of savings in 2012 up from the $50 million that we talked about, about 90 days ago.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "So it looks like normalizing for the tax issue in 2010 that your capital guidance is flat for 2011. So I was just wondering if you could provide sort of bridge that out for us and just provide some of like the puts and takes to get from '10 to '11? And then as a follow-up, just back to the Egypt issue. I think the Gulf States in general was enough, was big enough for you to call it out as a detriment to 2010 guidance. I'm just wondering as we look at that region in general, if unrest in Egypt sort of spreads region-wide? Would that be enough to cause the 2011 revenue outlook to be at risk?", "Scott Scheirman", "Look, let me first start on the cash flow. For 2011, we're estimating $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and again, that's a range. As we look forward, we think that the top line revenue growth of 3% to 4% will be helpful with that. There may be some changes in working capital. So overall, we feel good about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and we'll see where that goes as the year progresses, but we think that's very solid, very steady very consistent from that standpoint. On the Gulf States and potential challenges there, it's hard to predict the future for sure. As Hikmet mentioned, Egypt is less than 1% of our revenue. The Gulf States in general, we saw improvement in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year, but I'll also say as part of our 2011 outlook we've got very moderate expectations for the Gulf States. We'll have to see how all that plays out, but the beauty of our business model is being in 200 countries. There is no one country outside the U.S. that's more than 6% of our revenue, so diversification is very helpful being in 200 countries.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the M&A environment. You made a comment that seems to indicate it's a little bit more of a priority than maybe I would've thought versus prior quarter's commentary. Is it most likely still to be in money transfer-related entities? Or do you see more and more opportunities to do things around mobile or prepaid, some international platforms that may be for sale, those kinds of sort of electronic channel opportunities or what are they again, just to be back to sort of the traditional super agent or money transfer base properties?", "Hikmet Ersek", "This is Hikmet. If you look at our M&A side, which is aligned with our general strategy, right, I mean if you look at offline, that our Investors Day and several times in the past, I think if we look with our cash flow what we have, we looked at on the market exactly the things what we are focused on. Is it just a core business? Is it in the electronic channels? Is it in the Prepaid structure? The beauty of our business is generating a lot of cash, and with that, we also have the opportunity to be an active in the M&A targets. So I think we will continue to look at our adapting our -- this time, we are continuing to look at the market.", "Operator", "Our next question ", "comes from the line of David Parker with Lazard Capital Management.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "I was hoping if you could talk about maybe the regulatory environment. Is there anything that you're paying close attention to both domestically and internationally? And then also just specifically that you address the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the U.S. and do you anticipate any new regulation in your core Remittance business or in your Prepaid business from that entity?", "Hikmet Ersek", "David, it's Hikmet. As you know, that's operating in a very related environment, obviously, we are watching in every country, 200 countries and territories where we are active, we are watching the regulatory environment very close. So if you have experienced here how we operate, and I think we are very well positioned to respond to the regulatory needs. One of the things which are coming constantly the questions in especially the U.S. is a consumer side how transparent we are, and we believe that the way of how we operate is very transparent. You know that we have this fixed money transfer that we inform the sender immediately how much he has to pay, what's the transfer and the fees and on the effect. And so if the sender can quote also the receiver talking about the fees and the FX rates. So from that side, I believe we are well positioned to respond to the questions and to the needs of the regulatory environment.", "Michael Salop", "So it's just about the bottom of the hour, so we're going to close the call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. There's a reply of the call available. The call-in information is on our press release, on our website as well.

", "I'd would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome to everyone on the call. We believe our business is off to a good start in 2011 as we successfully executed against our strategies. We delivered 4% revenue growth, continue to make progress on margins and actively deployed our strong cash flow. Our Consumer-to-Consumer segment continue to produce strong trends as constant currency revenue increased 5% for the second quarter in a row. As always, this business, which is present in more than 200 countries and territories, represents a mix of performances in different markets.", "Asia Pacific got strong again with a 14% revenue increase driven by both growth across the region. We are also increasing our presence in the region by signing an Asian agreement with China Construction Bank, one of the leading banks in China. We now have over 100,000 Asian locations active in India and China combined. I was in China meeting with agents recently and I can tell you that there is a great excitement about the opportunities for our business.", "The Americas sustained the improvement realized in the fourth quarter delivering 6% revenue growth. Within the Americas, the U.S. domestic repositioning continue to generate successful results, with domestic money transfer revenue increasing 8%. Domestic transaction growth was strong again, with 21% which was impressive considering the 18% growth a shift in the 2010 first quarter immediately following our repositioning.", "In the Europe, Middle East, Africa, South Asia region, we saw similar constant currency trends to the fourth quarter in many of the markets, although there was some impact from the political unrest in the Ivory Coast, Egypt and Libya.", "I also want to take a minute to mention Japan. Although our business is very small there as we are in the early stage of building our brand and network, we, of course, want to help the people of Japan in dealing with this crisis. We have contributed to various efforts to assist in the disaster relief and also offered no-fee money transfer to the countries for a month following the earthquake and tsunami.", "Now turning to Global Business Payments. Revenue growth was flat as increases in investing business solutions were offset by declines in the Bill Payment business. There was good progress in Bill payments store. The Bill Payments revenue decline continued to moderate, only decreasing 2% and we saw improvement in margins relative to the fourth quarter. We have worked hard on the cost structure of this business, as well as on driving revenue opportunities. We have been aiding new billers and now have access to over 10,000 billers in the U.S.", "We have been adding electronic billing partnership with providers such as Online Resources and 3i Infotech and implementing improved technology that delivers a better consumer and agent experience. We have also been repositioning all our consumer Bill Payment products under the Western Union brand, which is allowing us to better manage the consumer value proposition to dynamic pricing and marketing.", "Western Union Business Solutions delivered 13% revenue growth in the quarter. We plan to continue to increase penetration and expense on new markets in B2B to direct online agent and partnership models over the next several years. We will also use innovation to better serve customers such as our recent introduction of a new foreign exchange payment service that allows small and medium enterprise business clients to make payments from their smartphones. Business-to-business cross-border payments remains one of our priority growth areas as the market is large and fragmented, the SME customers are underserved and we believe we can leverage our brand and cross-border expertise and global relationships to gain share.", "We also made further progress on our other strategic initiatives. In electronic channels, which include westernunion.com, account-based money transfer and mobile money transfer, revenue increased over 20% in the quarter and presented 3% of the total company revenue. Account-based money transfer services with  25 already activated, one of our recent agreements with Emirates National Bank of Dubai where we will offer account-based money transfer through online banking, mobile phones and ATMs to account holders in the United Arab Emirates. Also, in the EMEASA, we have just launched another ATM-based money transfer service with the Bank of Georgia. In Asia Pacific, we have activated online service with seven banks in Japan, and this summer, we will offer money transfer service through the bank's 15,000 ATMs. ", "In the Americas, we recently signed with U.S. Bank, which is already are working agent to offer online banking money transfer to their customers. By the way, this is our first such agreement with a top 10 bank in the U.S.. For bank account holders, we're seeing account-based money transfer as a great service to easily initiate transfers from home and connect to our global network of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories where we're seeing and we believe these are great opportunities to gain new consumers, as well offer more choice and convenience.", "Westernunion.com which is available in 20 countries have transaction growth in international markets over 40% while global transactions increased by 15%. In mobile money transfer, we continue to position ourselves to be at the center of the cross-border mobile money transfer infrastructure as it develops. We have 16 agreements in place with mobile network operators and banks and over 85,000 of our agent locations in 49 countries are enable to provide cash to mobile service. We recently expanded our services so far comes from subscribers in Kenya and we signed a master agreements for mobile money transfer with Etisalat Group, a leading mobile operator in 18 countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa.", "In prepaid, we increased our cards-in-force in the U.S. to over one million with retail distribution at over 10,000 locations. In the quarter, approximately $180 million of principal was loaded on to Western Union prepaid cards through over 500,000 loads. We will also launch prepaid cards in some international markets in the second half of the year, with the U.K. being of the first priorities.", "So overall, I feel positive about the start to the year. The Consumer-to-Consumer business continue to recent favorable trends as we increased our agent locations to 445,000. Our efforts to improve Bill Payments and expand the margins are starting to pay off. We're seeing in Business Solutions delivered solid growth and we made further strides with the development of electronic channels and prepaid.", "Excluding charges, we draw margin improvement, thanks to revenue growth, restructuring activities and other efficiencies. We continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow as we returned almost $570 million to the shareholders through repurchase and dividends in the quarter. And in April, we completed the acquisition of a leading European super agent.", "Now given the first quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year, we feel confident in affirming the full year financial outlook provided in February.", "Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to review our recent organization announcement. As you know, I became President and CEO in September and had been working on developing the right organization to best drive our key strategies. We made some changes last year, heading an executive [ph] to responsible for new products and services and streamlining some positions. We have not further redefined responsibilities and expanded the roles of several members of the executive team. ", "I am pleased that Stewart Stockdale has taken the position of Executive Vice President and President, Global Consumer Financial Services. Stewart is now responsible for all of the company's regions and agent network, leading the core consumer money transfer service and the Bill Payments business. We have a strong team of regional leaders with great track records that report to Stewart. This group includes: Jan Hillered for Europe and CIS; Jean Claude Farah for Middle East and Africa; Drina Yue for Asia Pacific; Victoria Lopez-Negrete for North America; and Odilon Almeida for South America.", "I think you all know the great accomplishments Stewart and his team has achieved in returning the Americas business to growth. Taking on Bill Payments and jumpstarting our prepaid efforts and I do look forward to Stuart now taking on a global leadership role.", "David Yates, who is our Executive Vice President and President of Business Development and Innovation, has responsibility for the design, development and implementation of all our new products and services. This includes rescuing business solutions, electronic channels and start value programs, including prepaid. David has extensive experience in the payments, banking and IT space and David's team will be a great driver of our key strategic initiatives of expanding electronic channels and developing new products and services.", "And finally, Diane Scott, who had been responsible for marketing in the Americas, has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. Diane has been an integral part of our success in the Americas and is now responsible for strategic global marketing, as well as communications and social responsibility. I am confident these changes will help guide Western Union to the next level of success and drive our key strategic initiative of growing retail channels, expanding electronic channels, developing new products and services, and improving process and productivity.", "Now to give you a more detailed review for the first quarter -- of the first quarter results, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, for the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 4% on both the reported and constant-currency basis. Transaction fee revenue increased 3% while foreign exchange revenue grew 8%. Within C2C transaction fee revenue increased 4% and foreign exchange revenue grew 7%. The consolidated revenue growth was driven by continued solid trends in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment and Western Union Business Solutions and further moderation of the revenue declines in our Bill Payment business.", "Our Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue increased 5%. Constant currency revenue growth was also 5%, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Transaction growth in our C2C segment for the quarter was 7% which compared to 9% in the fourth quarter. The transaction growth rate change was primarily due to the disruptions in the Ivory Coast, Egypt and Libya, and the more challenging comparisons from prior year, our U.S. domestic money transfer transaction growth.", "The company's C2C cross-border principal increased 7% in the quarter or 6% on a constant-currency basis. C2C principal per transaction increased 1% year-over-year on both the reported and constant-currency basis. This represented the first quarterly principal per transaction growth over two years.", "In the international C2C business, revenue also grew 5% on both the reported and constant currency basis, with transaction growth at 5%.", "Turning to the regions. Our C2C business in Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew revenue at 2% on transaction growth of 4%. Reported revenue growth improved in the fourth quarter primarily due to the strengthening of the euro. The transaction growth rate declined two points compared to the fourth quarter due to the impact of the Ivory Coast, Egypt and Libya, which individually are 1% or less of total company revenues, but added together, they impacted growth. Currently, most of our network in Egypt is back in operation and there are indications our agents in the Ivory Coast may be reopening soon, although Libya is largely remains closed. Constant currency revenue trends in Europe were similar to the fourth quarter, with growth in large markets such as Russia, Germany and the U.K. The Gulf states delivered overall transaction in the revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, while India revenue increased to 8% on 6% transaction growth.", "Last week, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 70% interest in one of our leading super agents in Europe, Angelo Costa, for cash consideration of approximately $140 million. As we stated in December, this acquisition will allow us to more directly access our network locations and be closer to our consumers, as well as more quickly introduce new products and services such as prepaid cards. We will also be able to optimize commission rates and achieve operating efficiencies by leveraging our European infrastructure, including the infrastructure attained through the FEXCO acquisition in 2009. We have begun the integration of Angelo Costa as we mentioned on our February 1 earnings call, we expect about a net $0.01 benefit to 2011 EPS from the acquisition. The benefit results from the reporting of the gain on our previous ownership interest, partially offset by a slight dilution from integration costs. The gain will be reported in the second quarter.", "We also continued to make progress with our retail agent expansion in Europe. We now have over 2,500 retail locations activated since the passage of the Payment Services Directive and are seeing good productivity at these locations. We are on target for European retail revenue of approximately 1% of total company revenue for 2011.", "Turning to the Americas region. We continued to see success from the U.S. domestic repositioning, as the Americas region delivered a revenue increase of 6% on transaction growth of 8%. Domestic money transfer revenue increased to 8% on transaction growth of 21% in the quarter. Domestic is delivering solid revenue growth, although we expect the transaction growth rates to moderate as we anniversary last year's large gains. We expect to see domestic revenue growth in 2011.", "Also in the region, Mexico transactions and revenue each increased 1% in the quarter. Mexico trends have stabilized the last few quarters, but we have modest expectations for this business until we start to see more substantial job creation in the U.S.", "The Asia Pacific region delivered revenue growth of 14% on an 11% transaction increase. There were once again many markets across Asia Pacific contributing to the growth, with China posting increases of 12% in revenue and 5% on transactions. For the overall C2C business, the spread between transaction revenue growth in the quarter was two percentage points with no impact from currency. The spread was equally split between pricing and mix and narrowed from the fourth quarter as both impacts declined. For the full year, we continue to expect price decreases in the 2% to 3% range.", "Moving to the Global Business Payments segment. Overall revenue was flat, the Bill Payment business declined moderate to further with a revenue decrease of 2%, while Western Union Business Solutions revenues increased 13%. In Bill Payments, continued strong international growth and increases in electronic payments drove the improvement.", "Western Union Business Solutions is on track for the expected mid-teens revenue growth for the year and benefited from increases in online revenue.", "Turning to margins. The first quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 24.4%, excluding restructuring charges, the consolidated operating margin was 26.3%. The margin, excluding restructuring charges, improved approximately 70 basis points from the same period last year as revenue leverage and operating efficiencies, including restructuring savings, more than offset some negative foreign change impact in increased investment spending. We recorded $24 million of restructuring charges in the quarter related to our previously announced programs. Approximately $7 million of the charge is included in cost of services and $17 million is in SG&A. These charges are not included in our segment operating results.", "We realized approximately $8 million of savings from restructuring activities in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $50 million of pretax restructuring charges and approximately $50 million of related savings. The tax rate in the quarter was 23.5% or 24.1% excluding the impact of the restructuring charges. This is consistent with our full year expectation of 24% to 25%. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.32 or $0.35, excluding restructuring charges. GAAP EPS was $0.30 in the first quarter of last year. Our C2C segment operating margin in the quarter was 28.6%, an increase of 120 basis points over the same period last year. The increase was driven by the same factors that favorably affected the consolidated margins.", "Global Business Payments operating margin was 16.5% in the quarter, which compared to 20.7% in the first quarter of 2010. The margin declined compared to last year primarily due to revenue decreases and mix shifts in U.S. Bill Payment and additional investments in Western Union Business Solutions. The margin increased 320 basis points relative to the fourth quarter's 13.3% as a result of lower integration costs in the Western Union Business Solutions and the restructuring savings and other costs structure changes in our Bill Payment business. As a reminder, we expect Western Union Business Solutions to be non-dilutive to earnings for the full year.", "Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. First quarter cash flow from operations was $252 million and capital expenditures were $22 million. At quarter end, the company had total debt of $3.6 billion and cash of $2.2 billion, of which approximately $1 billion was outside the United States. In the quarter, we issued $300 million of a two-year floating rate debt. As a reminder, we have approximately $700 million of debt maturing in November 2011 that we planned to refinance.", "We are active with capital deployment in the quarter. We spent $525 million to repurchase 25 million shares or 4% of the total shares outstanding at an average price of $20.95. We also paid $45 million in quarterly dividends. As of March 31st, we had $890 million remaining under our stock repurchase authorization which expires on December 31, 2012. Given the solid start to the year, we are comfortable with the full year 2011 financial outlook we've provided on February 1. Our 2011 full year outlook calls for: constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4%; GAAP revenue growth similar to constant currency; GAAP operating margin expansion to approximately 26% in 2011 compared to 25% in 2010; operating margin expansion to approximately 27% in 2011, excluding restructuring charges compared to 26% in 2010; GAAP EPS of $1.41 to $1.46, including $0.06 of restructuring charges; EPS of $1.47 to $1.52, excluding restructuring charges; and GAAP cash flow from operating activities of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.", "At this time, we have not changed our foreign exchange rate assumptions compared to our February outlook. As a reminder, on a full year basis, each 5% move in European currency impacts revenue by approximately $55 million, but pretax operating profit by only $7 million due to our hedges.", "In summary, the results for the first quarter were solid. The sustained momentum in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, moderating revenue declines in Bill Payments and solid growth in Western Union Business Solutions. We made further progress on our strategic priorities and we have strong deployment of capital, returning almost $570 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends in the quarter and completing our European super agent acquisition earlier this month.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Hikmet, I wanted to ask you how much of the next leg, to whether the revenue growth acceleration and/or margin expansion will be driven by company-specific initiatives, and how much is relying on the macro settling down and becoming steadier? And the reason I'm asking the question is because the uptick in the principal per transaction that picked up a little bit in the quarter for the first time in eight, so I'm just wondering what that will do, too?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Adam, if you look at our business, the beauty of our business is being in the 200 countries, and obviously, being on 16,000 corridors has the different dynamics of the business. Some parts of the corridors have different pricing, some parts of the corridors have different dynamics. But generally, I feel comfortable with the outlook. I believe also that migration will continue. I believe also despite the crisis which happened recently in the Middle East, we are very positioned to be so far business being in 200 countries, it carries funds of different prices, differently. So overall, I would say that from business wise, I am satisfied. Besides that, having 445,000 locations, being in 200 countries and having such a strong brand gives us also specific -- we can also the specific activities on electronic channels, I'm pleased with our current development on electronic account-based money transfer which uses from Account-to-Cash gives us a very good position. And the other thing is also we have now 3% on electronic channels, our westernunion.com is growing very good and I believe also we are and very well-positioned. Do you want to add something?", "The only thing I'd add, Adam, in the near-term for 2011, we don't expect the economic environment to be substantially better or worse. It's about the same but our objective no matter what the economy is to continue to gain market share as we move forward, whether it's in the core money transfer business where we have a 17% share, or in our newer opportunities that probably play out over the next couple of years, whether that's prepaid, free at the electronic channels, but we think we really can control our destiny as we move forward.", "Adam Frisch - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And if could just follow that up with one more, in terms of flexibility on the marketing spending, let's say things do to take a turn down on the macro scene and the economy starts to sputter again around the globe whether be geopolitical reasons or what have you, if you want to preserve the bottom-line growth in terms of a steady operating margins and EPS at revenue growth decelerates, or even accelerates at a slower rate, do you have the flexibility there? Are you managing, if push comes to shove, are you managing for operating margin or are you managing for revenue growth?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think obviously, we are really much focused for the health for the business. I think we are a global brand, ever and as our expansions continue to grow, I mean we have 445,000 locations now, and we kind of continue to add new locations investor. We are going to invest in our brand's awareness. We're going to continue to invest also in the new initiatives. I think we are affirming our outlook for the year. We are very well-positioned to affirm our outlook and confirm our outlook, which we gave in February.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Credit Suisse.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I just wanted to talk a little bit about the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia corridor. The transaction growth moderated there a little bit, went from, I think 6% in the fourth quarter and transactions to 4%. Was that entirely, when you look at it, is that entirely due to some of the disruptions in the Middle East? I think you mentioned Ivory Coast, Egypt and Libya?", "Scott Scheirman", "Bryan, this is Scott. I would say on the EMEA division, if you will, what primarily impacted the transaction growth rate would be Libya, Ivory Coast as we move forward, including Egypt. But frank  want to remember too, that as we think about the C2C business although transactions moved from 9% in the fourth quarter to 7% in the first quarter, the constant currency revenue growth in our C2C business which is about 85% of our revenue was 5% in both quarters, so very strong, very stable. And in the C2C business, we were able to drive 120 basis points of margin expansion. With that said, Egypt, we're back up and running in that market there. Ivory Coast, we expect to be soon, hard to say for certain, but we expect to be soon. And I would say Libya was still down but compared to the other two markets, and important market, but it is much, much smaller than the other 2 markets.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Any impact at all, any spillover into the UAE or Saudi Arabia that you're seeing from this political unrest?", "Scott Scheirman", "Not really. We did see in the Gulf States in the first quarter both positive transaction in revenue growth, exactly what we saw in the fourth quarter. So those markets continue to perform nicely. We've had modest expectations for the Gulf States in 2011, But Q1 pulled through very consistent with the fourth quarter with positive transaction revenue growth.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And also, recently I've been to the Middle East. I have to say that our position is there pretty well there, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, terrific. Last question for me. It was great to see the margins bounce a little bit there in the Global Business Payments division. What do we expect, Scott, maybe going forward, is that -- should it bounce around that 16.5% level or will there be some shocks to that in the margin as we go forward?", "Scott Scheirman", "Bryan, in that business, we're really focused on a number of things. Clearly, we want to, with the U.S. Bill Payment Business is to continue to get the revenue declines to moderate, the revenue was down 5% in the fourth quarter, it was down 2% in the first quarter. So we're making progress. We want to continue to make that progress there. ", "In addition, as part of that segment, is Western Union Business Solutions. With that business grew 13% and we expect to grow it mid-teens. So the combination of working to get the top line going north and not south is going to be helpful. What we've also signed on more billers, we're now up to 10,000 billers in that business that I think will be helpful to us and then we're very focused on the cost structure there. Western Union Business Solutions will not be dilutive in 2011, so the profitability profile will get better. But the objective on a consolidated basis is really to grow our margins to 27% which should be up about 80 basis points compared to 2010. So we think the combination of what we can do with Global Business Payments and then our C2C business which is about 85% of our top line, the revenue growth, the restructuring, some pushback for investment in the future, we can drive margin expansion in the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Kissane with BAML [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Scott, can you provide a little more color on the spread between domestic revenue and domestic transaction, I mean and the spread definitely narrowed but seemed pretty wide and you anniversaried the price cuts in the fourth quarter. So just a little more color there.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, Jim, we still do have some spread there. We had 8% net revenue growth on the 21% transaction growth in the quarter and that's a business that carries a 30% margin, so we like that the revenue growth profile there. If you recall, we implemented the $5 for $50 program midway through the fourth quarter of 2010, so we still have some lapping of that as we move forward. I do expect that, that spread will probably narrow as we move throughout the year, we do expect that business, domestic money transfer to have revenue growth in 2011.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And just given the large buyback, is it safe to assume and you see better value in your stock than in potential M&A transactions?", "Scott Scheirman", "Jim, I would describe it as that as we think about our cash in our cash flow priorities. Clearly, our first two priorities are to invest in the business and to acquire good companies and as we acquire companies, we look at those strategic fit in the right cash-on-cash economic returns. But a close third priority is, clearly returning cash back to our shareholders.  So given the $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion in cash flow we anticipate, we have over $2 billion of cash in our balance sheet, that really gives us the flexibility to do a number of things. So as we move throughout the year, we'll prioritize our capital deployment in those terms. But we are pleased with the $525 million that we bought back and we still have $890 million left under the authorization.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And if I can get one last question, just maybe the performance of FEXCO, now that you control it versus the super agent relationship or arrangement you have?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I'll -- I mean, I think we are pleased with our performance in our businesses in Europe. We do have direct access now to the subagents and our brand awareness, our service quality is increasing.  I think also it has, it affects the acquisition as within our business plan and also, I am very excited about the recent announcement with Angelo Costa. If you combine FEXCO and Costa together and beat the PSD incentive [ph], I think they have the right treasuries to expand our business in Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just real quickly, Scott, on the conversation you made about margins expanding for the year, I apologize if I missed this, but did you give any clarity on where you thought the Consumer-to-Consumer segment margins would be relative to the Global Business Payment margins this quarter, 28.6 1/2%?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, not specific, Julio. We're going to -- our objective is to expand our margins to 27%, so clearly, I'd see the C2C margin since they're 85% of our top line, those margins will grow in 2011. And compared to the fourth quarter, our Global Business Payments where we did have a 13% margin which were 16.5% in the first quarter, we want to improve those margins as we move through the year. Clearly, getting the top line stabilizing that, getting the revenue to find some moderate will be helpful. But when you think about the C2C business, that's a majority of our top line and those margins were up 120 basis points. We feel like we've got a business model that with revenue growth we can drive margin expansion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "My question is, I guess, on pricing, and did I hear you right, pricing down about 1% in the quarter and if that's the case, then if you're still holding to pricing being down, call it, something approaching 3%, is that potential for upside down the road or is that an investment in growth that you think you're planning?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Ashwin, if you look at -- from a strategic point of view, if you look at our resale but generally our pricing and business was of around 2% to 3%. And I think we are staying within this guidance. And don't forget that our biggest price investment was about 15, 16 months ago, Scott, right? It was the DMT money transfer which is our biggest corridor, so-called corridor because business within that corridor, U.S. domestic money transfer. Despite that, we're going to continue to invest in the pricing, looking at corridors within the 2% to 3% pricing that many as I think the right direction. It depends on the form from quarter-to-quarter from the promotions we do it and also watching where we can gain market share.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And in the Global Payments business, obviously, a very good improvement, much better than we expected there. But should we continue to look for slow steady improvement or is there something structural that you can do that is more in the nature of a more permanent fix?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think if you look at the Global Business Payments, the sector, we are very focused on our U.S. Bill Payment business. I think the revenue declined moderated there to minus 2% and but the team is doing a great job there. We consolidated under Stewart Stockdale' team and we are really very focused on getting new billers. We have now to our aggregators of about excess to 10,000 billers. And this is a definite loss of diversifying our portfolio of the top line. But we also focus on the bottom line to expanding your margins.  And I'm very optimistic and also the business solutions part having 13% revenue growth, it's quite within our guidance saying that always we want to achieve the 10s revenue growth. So I am pleased with the results there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "I understand about the domestic growth business, you said transactions should moderate and that makes a lot of sense, but looking at the revenue growth you had in the first quarter, would it be accurate to assume that, that business can at least grow mid-single digits for 2011?", "Scott Scheirman", "Kartik, we haven't provided any specific color on that other than we believe in 2011, domestic money transfer revenue will grow with 7% in the fourth quarter, 8% in the first quarter revenue growth. We're off to a good start. We like what we're seeing. And as I mentioned earlier, the business has got 30% plus margin. So we're going to keep working hard at that business, but we like where it's heading and what it's doing.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "When you talked about Bill Payment business and since the ability to sign billers and it seems as though that business has enough potential to get better, as you look at that business, is this that you just need to sign more billers? Or is this more of the economy just needs to keep continuing to get better for that business to really turn around?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think it's a general answer here. It's a general question. I would say generally both, right? I think the economy has helped here also but also our efforts the team is really very focused to signing new billers under their focus on the top line. But also, as I mentioned before, they're focused on the bottom line and I think the team is doing a good job here.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "But I guess, my question was more, how much control does Western Union have? You seem to have executed better in that business and the business is moving in the right direction. But what I'm trying to figure out is, how much more control Western Union has and how much at some point you just have to rely on the economy getting better?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we are focused. Just -- if you think about our business, Bills Payments business, the consumer business, part of our consumer business under Stewart leadership in the global consumer leadership, I think we have some synergies here. We found that our sales force are on the road, approaching dealers, approaching our agents and we are increasing the service systems but also definite that the economy's helping us also.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then last question, what impact, if any, would you anticipate on the business from increasing gasoline prices, whether its impacted the domestic business or more revenue going into the Middle East that could create more projects and more immigrant flow there? Just your thoughts on impact on what's happening to oil and gas prices.", "Scott Scheirman", "Kartik, this is Scott. I'd say all those things, that it's hard to tell for certain.  But if I look at our customer profile, their objective is as they migrate from 1 country to another to support their families back home, whether that's for rent, medicine, school, or whatever it might be. So their goal is always to remit as much money back as they can to their home country. And so as we saw the international principle per transaction, it was up 2% in the first quarter, it's best to spend it in a couple of years, not necessarily declaring victory on that yet, but we like the trends we're seeing there. But my sense of for our customers, their spend on gasoline is probably a very, very small of their disposable income. So I think their goal is to get money back to their customers, to their loved ones.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "As you look at the restructuring efforts you're making this year, Scott, as you look out, say, to the future years, '12, '13, do you think there are sustainable cost savings associated with that, that are going to be an important part of the long-term margin drivers for the company?", "Scott Scheirman", "Andrew, I would describe it as that, we've taken actions that will save about $50 million in operating expenses in 2011 and then about $70 million in 2012. So we really like the progress that we've made. One of our key initiatives is improving our processes and productivity to ensure that we have efficient operating structure, that we're providing outstanding service to our customers, our agents that were able to effectively launch our new channels and so forth. ", "So all the things that go along with strong processes and productivity. So as we move forward, as we think about our business model and margin expansion that we believe the business model will set up to drive margin expansion in that, revenue growth will be helpful to that process productivity, the restructuring savings being operationally excellent and then offsetting some of that would be investment back in the business to drive the top line. But in summary, we think just all of those initiatives will be helpful as we move forward.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And Hikmet, could you clarify or elaborate on the comment in the press release about U.S. Bank? I know one of your efforts has been Account-to-Cash with the big U.S. banks and maybe that has developed a little more slowly than you would have liked. Is the U.S. Bank signing a step in that direction, specifically? And then how would you characterize the pipeline of deals like that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Having the beauty of our business having 445,000 locations globally, the cash pay outside, right? I think nobody can match that one. And connecting a console does meet 445,000 locations globally in minutes, it's a huge opportunity. We signed 45 banks globally. I think 29 of them we activated, Scott, 29 of ...", "Scott Scheirman", "25 of them.", "Hikmet Ersek", "25 of them we activated. We connect to direct to our host. The beauty of that is you got your constant electronic the money to 445,000 locations. Now the U.S. Bank is one of the first top banks globally and we are very pleased with that state. Also account holders can connect that to 455,000 locations globally. They can connect that. So I think they are more on the pipeline and I am very optimistic on that side.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. All right, and then one last quick one, Scott, housekeeping wise, looks like you bought back a lot of stock toward the end of the quarter. What should we think about as the fully diluted share count in the -- currently, I guess, or at the end of the first quarter?", "Scott Scheirman", "The input I would give you, Andrew, is, as we think about deploying our cash flow, we'll invest in the business, acquire companies that are strategically the right fit and have the right cash and cash economic return. And then we want to deploy capital to our shareholders through stock buyback and dividend. And I haven't provided any specific target externally. And the reason being is, I just want to keep the flexibility as we deploy our cash flow of what's the best way to use utilize our cash flow and our cash for our shareholders as we move forward. But we were active in 2010 in buying back stock. We've been active in 2011 and we still have $890 million available for stock buybacks through December of 2012.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Right. I appreciate all that. I'm just wondering if you could tell us what the share count is currently?", "Scott Scheirman", "When we file our 10-Q, you'll be able to see it at that point in time, of what are the outstanding shares, I'll probably just have you wait for them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Is agent productivity increasing or decreasing in the C2C business on a global basis? And can you discuss Asian productivity by the three major geographic regions?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure, David. As you know we have currently 455,000 locations and we're going to continue to add and expand our agent locations globally. It seems on the field are working very hard from that. I'm fairly pleased in our recent activities in South Asia, Asia and also in Europe with our new retail locations. But if you look at our business, you have to differentiate between send and receive sites. Obviously, our productivity is different on the send side with ethnic locations, with post office locations on the receive side, also on the different dynamics here. But generally, adding location means also adding transactions, getting more access to the consumers, gaining market share and getting new consumers at the time. We are targeted as gaining market share as we have 17.4% market share globally on remittance market and I'm going to continue to expect that.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "So is agent productivity increasing or decreasing?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, we never talk about the specific number here but I'm very pleased with our current agent productivity.", "Scott Scheirman", "The other thing I would add is, if you do the simple math, David, it's been about the same in the first quarter, if you will, but if you think about it as we add locations, we added about 10,000 locations in the first quarter, many of those were actually in Asia Pacific, in particular, India. But what's important about the business model is both the send side and the receive side. So as you think about productivity, we also have to take into consideration the send transaction overseas and having that right receive network is very helpful to send transactions to.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask just for some clarification with regard to the principal per transaction increasing 1%. Does that -- two questions here -- does that include the electronic channels which are now up to 3% of total revenue? And if you could share some color on the behavior of those electronic channels when you think about the principal per transaction that's actually moving.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, it does include the electronic channels and just to highlight that the C2C principal per transaction was up about 1%. If you segment that just to be international business which is about 70% of our revenues, that was up about 2% for the quarter, if you will. Today, the international -- excuse me, Electronic business became 3% of our top line, it grew by about 20% in the first quarter. But as you think about that, it's just a very still a small piece of the total C2C business today.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay. And then if you would, looking forward, which regions or corridors would you anticipate will drive C2C transaction growth this year? I know you don't always get that grade up, but like for China, we have the 14%. Is that the market or is that your presence, India, China, you're up to 100,000. Which of these corridors do you think are going to be the major drivers of growth this year? Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think Asia Pacific is definitely an opportunity for us. The 14% you refer is basically as a region for Asia Pacific I guess and the 100,000 locations are combined India and China. We will continue to focus on Asia Pacific? On the Stewart Stockdale leadership Drina Yue leadership, the team is doing a pretty good job there in China. We signed another major bank, it's the China Construction Bank, which gives us even more locations there. And I recently was in China, was in China, I have to say that the team and the agents are very motivated about our business, not only on China, I would say Asia Pacific generally is a huge opportunity and compared with the general market share, I think they are still below the market, we can expand our market penetration and become again market share there.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Thank you, Hikmet.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Parker with Lazard Capital Markets.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. I was just hoping you could possibly expand on some of the announcements you had during the quarter, specifically just expanding your distribution channel and prepaid with your partnership with income and then also with your bill payment with your relationship with Kmart.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. I think we are having now about inventory income design. We are very pleased with that relationship with income. That gives us the availability to sign more location to distribute our prepaid cards. We are currently, it's in the beginning stages though income we will have direct access to the retailers which we're going to continue to sign them and we are at 10,000 locations to distribute our prepaid cards. On the Bill Payments business, we are signing more and more billers. Also through our aggregators, we have access to 10,000 billers now. We recently had 5,000 and now it's 10,000. Scott, is that right?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, that's right. And what I'd add on Kmart, Kmart's a very important retailer in the U.S. as everybody knows and now they're taking on our comprehensive suite of Bill Payment solutions. So whether you need to make an urgent bill payment in five minutes or then the next day one, they've got a comprehensive suite of bill payment solutions that are granted Western Union and Kmart has been a really nice partner of ours for many years.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And this kind of retailer is important, they have traffic and I think our brands there earlier would drive really attractive to that retailers and they sit besides making billed payments and money transfer also selling the other products in their retail shops.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then just on a different note, with the Obama administration looking at or potentially looking at immigration reform, are you guys doing anything proactively or any thoughts on that topic?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we are definitely -- and as we do in every country, also in the U.S., we definitely talk with regulators and with governments. We are actively and hand-in-hand talking about that and we are constantly in contact with that.", "David Parker - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I just wanted to follow up on the discussion of prepaid. I wanted to know how, well, if it's -- if you have data yet, on how the prepaid cards might be impacting customer loyalty and what the spend rate is on those cards once they're loaded? Thanks.", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure. The number of the prepaid cards have been prior loyalty cardholders and what we do know about loyalty cardholders that the retention rates and frequency rates are higher from that standpoint. As we look at the Prepaid business, it's very early days now. We do have a million prepaid cards in force, but we are seeing some good consumer behavior around point-of-sale, utilizing for ATM withdrawals and so forth, and then, as you saw in the quarter, we have 500,000 loads onto those cards. So it's early to have comprehensive statistics on this, but the early ratings are, we're getting good usage out of the prepaid cards.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And what are the --- I don't remember if you mentioned it, but what the economics are on the loads?", "Scott Scheirman", "It depends how the customer loads the card. Our value proposition is pretty friendly, so that if you go to one of our 50,000 locations in the U.S. to load the card, we would charge $4.95. Some of those economics pass back to the agent. We keep some of those economics. But if they do a direct deposit, then there's no fee to the customer and then really, the deal we've struck with the card issuing bank as a lot of the economics pass back to us and the position is to be really be fee friendly and the goal as with our customers is we want to retain them over two- or three- or four-year period.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. And if I could just ask 1 more question, has the CFPB engaged you yet? What will eventually be a study of the industry?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes. We're in contact with the staff there. We've had meetings. We will have meetings. And then Hikmet can share more with you on some of his initiatives there.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think are very close in contact with them. I am meeting them also, the meetings are set up. I think, we are openly discussing with them with all these initiatives. So I think we are in contact with them.", "Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thanks. I guess first, what was the growth rate in the investment spending year-over-year during the quarter?", "Scott Scheirman", "Chris, we didn't break that out separately. Well the color we did provide is that our investment spending in the first quarter of 2011 was higher than the prior quarter. We definitely see good opportunities in the electronic channels, prepaid, B2B and the core Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business. But with that said, with that increased investment spending, giving our operation efficiencies, restructuring and then revenue growth, we still were able to expand margins by 70 basis points.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And I guess among those major categories of the e channels, with dot com, and account to cash mobile prepaid, I think, was the investment spending sort of broadly spread out among those areas or was there disproportionate amount in any of the categories?", "Scott Scheirman", "From quarter-to-quarter, it varies as far as the initiatives, the promotions, the programs that are going on. But I would say, for sure in the core money transfer business, electronic channels, prepaid, B2B, all of those we think are good medium to long-term growth strategies for us. So we've invested in those.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think also, under David Yates leadership, the team is doing a good job to focusing on the right approach. Given his background and the team's background, I think the -- plus building on our fundamentals, being on 200 countries and this connection, the cash dot com, cash electronic, I think that's a huge competitive advantage we have there. And so you have the right investments here combined.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then just a follow up on Account-to-Cash, with U.S. Bank, is that -- it seems like a pretty big breakthrough to us I mean given that this is the first major U.S. Bank the sign on for that. I mean is that the right way to think about this or I mean is it more just like the 46 banks to sign up for the service and I think that in my order of magnitude, this is probably a lot bigger and more significant than like, the Emirates Bank. But tell me if I'm wrong. And then also, could you just share any early expectations? Like is the U.S. Bank going to, have they committed to market behind that to make their customers aware of the service or how that's going to work?", "Hikmet Ersek", "First of all, I'm very pleased with the U.S. Bank. And yes, the answer is yes. They are dedicated to grow this business with us together and I think I'm very pleased that even in the U.S., also, we are expanding now, account based money transfer. If you recall that our success, as we mentioned several times with Canada, with Scotia Bank or in Switzerland the Swiss Post Bank. I think there are many examples, in Turkey, with the Currency Bank, I think we mentioned that several times in several calls about our success, we are building on that and now we are in the U.S. signing that one of the top 10 banks with U.S. Bank giving the access to the cardholder is a huge step. Other than that also it will take some time, right? You have to connect the host to a host and get the old right IT structure here. But yes, the U.S. Bank is very focused on that.", "Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Thank you. Just two questions. Number one, on the domestic money transfer and that revenue growth and transaction growth, directionally, does that translate, should we think about translating into margin expansion in the U.S. division? Could that you have talked about that generally the U.S. is still one of your highest margin markets? And then I have a follow-up.", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, Tim, this is Scott. I would say yes, that is hopeful to profitability or margin expansion the business that of a 30% plus margin profile.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. And then the second one was on prepaid and you referenced international expansion plans, I think, in the back half of the year. Could you talk about your expectations for sort of the, I guess, the scale of your Prepaid business with more of a sort of an international and global rollout? Do you still expect to see a pretty nice curve around margin expansion as revenue grows or will in international footprint maybe limit margin expansion relative to the type of revenue growth when we think about that business?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Tim, given our global presence, our opportunities is huge. The opportunities being in 200 countries and don't forget also that card issuance like having your own bank license in Europe, most of our agent international our banks and post offices, they have the license to issue cards with our brand, with our presence. I think the opportunity is huge to expand the prepaid model. As I mentioned before, we are stocking in the U.K. as a first market, but also other markets are online to expand our presence here and the Western Union brand, the Western Union presence, the customer relationship having 65 million senders and about 100 million receivers, in our portfolio expanding another product to these customers each opportunity.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay, that's all I had. Thanks so much.", "Scott Scheirman", "Thanks Tim.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Tim. I just wanted to say to thank you to everyone for joining the call and thank you for your questions also. I just wanted to summarize again that as I mentioned earlier, we are really off to a good start in 2011. There are still some challenges around the world, but our Consumer-to-Consumer business trends are good, Bill Payments is improving, Business Solutions is growing as expected and electronic channels grew to 3% of our total revenue.", "We are executing against our strategies, making good progress on margins and continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow. So thank you to all who joined us on the call and we hope to have -- I hope that you all have a good evening. Thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. That does conclude the presentation. You may disconnect.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chantilly, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor -- Investment Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Michael Salop", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we'll have comments from Hikmet Ersek, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in a supplemental table with our press release.", "As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2010 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Other than the replay, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome to everybody on the call. We continue to see solid trend across our business in the quarter. We reported revenue increasing 7%, and constant currency revenue up 5%. And we are pleased to be able to raise our full year outlook for both revenue and earnings per share.", "The consumer-to-consumer segment, constant currency revenue increased 5% for the third consecutive quarter. Reported revenue in C2C increased 8% and was aided by the stronger euro. Each of our regions provided good revenue growth. Asia Pacific increased 16%, which included double-digit growth from China. Revenue in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew 8%. Most of the large European markets continue to perform well, and we also saw good growth from the Gulf States and a double-digit revenue increase in India.", "There was still some negative impact from the Ivory Coast as agent locations were closed in April and then gradually reopened through May, but business is largely returning back to normal by end of the quarter. The Americas region delivered 5% revenue growth, with continued growth in the U.S. outbound, still challenging business in Mexico and further strong performance from U.S. domestic money transfer. Domestic money transfer revenue increased 9% on 19% transaction growth, and we continue to be very pleased with the results of the repositioning we undertook in late 2009.", "We were also able to make further strides with our North American banking strategy in the quarter as we signed Regions Bank and its 1,700 U.S. locations, as an agent for both money transfer and expedited bill payment, with plans to have account-based money transfer over time. Globally, we added another 15,000 Asian locations in the quarter, bringing our total to 470,000 locations.", "Turning to Global Business Payments. Revenue increased 4%, thanks to contributions from both Western Union Business Solutions and the Bill Payment business. In Bill Payments, we reported revenue growth of 2%, our first quarterly increase since 2008 and also delivered good margin improvements. Just this month, we launched a new service with Alibaba, a global e-commerce leader based in China. Now buyers of goods on the AliExpress.com e-commerce platform have the option of paying cash at Western Union Agent location in more than 160 countries and territories. This service provides convenience to buyers, quick cash flow to sellers and the new revenue opportunity for Western Union, leveraging our brand, agent network and cross-border money movement capabilities.", "Western Union Business Solutions delivered 14% revenue growth in the quarter. We also took our first steps towards utilizing our agent network to distribute business payment services in some markets. We've signed agreements with agent in the Philippines, Peru and Chile, which will offer the services to the SMEs in these countries later this year. These agents will develop sales forces, and utilize local contract and market knowledge to build the business. This model also lowers the cost of entering a new market for Western Union Business Solutions. ", "And of course, we announced earlier this month that we agreed to acquire Travelex Global Business Payments from Travelex Holdings. As I mentioned on our July 5 conference call, I'm very excited about the foundation we will establish in business-to-business cross-border payments by combining this business with Western Union Business Solutions. The B2B market is big and growing, and the cross-border payments needs of small business are largely underserved today. The acquisition will immediately give us a presence in 16 countries, including 7 where Business Solutions currently is not present. We will have a combined sales force of 450 people, strong product and service capabilities, and extensive bank and banking and payment connectivity across the world. ", "We also have the opportunity to leverage the Western Union brand, balance sheet, agent network and global financial institution and regulatory relationships. In addition to serving small- and medium-sized enterprises, Travelex Global Business Payments also has a sizable business providing international payment services to third-party distribution channels such as banks, with over 500 financial institution customers in North America and Australia. We expect this acquisition to close late this year. It will take some time to integrate the companies and platforms and implement our combined growth strategies, but we believe this will be a great growth opportunity for many years to come.", "Let me also give you a quick update on some of our strategic initiatives. In electronic channels, which include westernunion.com, account-based money transfer and mobile money transfer, revenue increased over 35% in the quarter and represented 3% of our total company revenue. Our electronic account-based money transfer transactions, which includes cash-to-account and account-to-cash through banks increased approximately 40% in the quarter. We now have over 60 banks signed to offer account-based money transfer services with 30 active. ", "In Italy, our ATM-based service with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo is now being activated. The bank customers will be able to send electronic money transfers from their accounts using ATMs. And we expect to rollout to 7,000 in Intesa Sanpaolo ATMs in the third quarter. ", "Westernunion.com had transaction growth in international markets of nearly 40% and globally, transactions increased by over 25%. In mobile money transfer, we have 18 agreements in place with mobile network operators and banks, and over 100,000 of our agent locations in 57 countries are enabled to provide cash-to-mobile service. ", "In the quarter, we added an iPhone app that allows U.S. consumers to transfer money from their phone with a debit or credit card. We also have in place, a service that allows Western Union Business Solutions' customers to initiate international payments from their accounts through smartphones. As you can see, all these examples, demonstrate that we are making good progress with our electronic channel initiatives. ", "In stored value, our prepaid cards in force in the U.S. now total 1.1 million, with retail distribution at 12,000 locations. In the second quarter, approximately $120 million of principal was loaded onto Western Union prepaid cards through 500,000 loads. We continue to expand our efforts in the U.S., and we have some very good potential partnership opportunities in the pipeline. ", "Due to the late timing of these partnerships and retail distribution deals, we probably will not reach our goal of doubling the cards in force this year, as we have been adding about 100,000 cards each quarter. However, as stated previously, we still expect prepaid revenues to be approximately 1% of total company revenue in 2011. We are also continuing our growth for international expansion launches later this year in the U.K. and other markets. International expansion of stored value is a great opportunity, but will also take some time to develop market by market.", "So our initiatives are moving forward and our overall business performance has been solid. We do not expect global economic conditions to improve significantly this year, but we have confidence in our business trends and are comfortable increasing our financial outlook. We continue to deploy our strong cash flow to invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions to aid our growth strategies and return funds to shareholders. ", "In addition to the Travelex Global Business Payment acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of 2011, we completed the Angelo Costa agent acquisition in Europe in April and plan to complete the Finint acquisition by end of the year. We also been active with returning cash to shareholders. In the first 2 quarters, we have purchased $660 million of our shares and paid $95 million in dividends, which included a 14% dividend increase in the second quarter. ", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the quarter and our full year outlook, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, for the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 7% on a reported basis or 5% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation added approximately $32 million to GAAP revenues in the quarter, primarily due to the strength of the European currencies. Transaction fee revenue increased 6%, while foreign exchange revenue grew 12%. ", "Within C2C, revenue increased 8%, with transaction fee revenue up 7% and foreign exchange revenue up 12%. Foreign exchange revenue was primarily driven by growth in cross-border principal, which increased 10% in the quarter. The consolidated revenue increase reflected continued solid growth in each of our consumer-to-consumer regions, the translation effect of stronger European currencies and growth in Western Union Business Solutions. In addition, our Bill Payments business turned to positive revenue growth in the quarter. ", "In the consumer-to-consumer segment, revenue increased 8%. Constant currency revenue growth in C2C was 5%, which was consistent with the first quarter, while transaction growth was 6%, down just slightly from the first quarter. The company's C2C cross-border principal increased 10% or 6% on a constant currency basis. C2C principal per transaction increased 4% year-over-year and was flat on a constant currency basis. ", "In the international C2C business, revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. International transaction growth was 5%, consistent with the first quarter. International constant currency principal per transaction increased 1% compared to the prior year, which was the third consecutive quarterly increase. This is a positive trend, as consumers sending more money generally indicates they have more confidence in our economic outlook or have a better employment situation. Including the impact of currency, international principal per transaction increased 6% in the quarter. ", "The market research from Aite just published its revised estimate of the cross-border remittance market for 2009 and 2010. Aite estimated the principal market at $398 billion in 2010, a 3% increase from 2009 and projects growth to improve to 5% in 2011 and 2012. Based on Aite's data, Western Union's cross-border market share was 17.2% in 2010, an increase of approximately 50 basis points from 2009, and we are confident we will gain share again in 2011. ", "Turning to the regions. Our C2C business in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region grew revenue at 8% on transaction growth of 4%. Transaction growth was consistent with the first quarter, while revenue growth improved primarily due to the strengthening of the euro. Constant currency revenue trends in Europe improved slightly compared to the first quarter led by Germany. France and Russia also continued to deliver solid growth. We completed the Angelo Costa acquisition in April and signed an agreement to purchase Finint, which we expect to close later this year for approximately EUR 100 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. Costa and Finint were 2 of our largest super agents in Europe and further advance our European strategy of having more direct access to the agent locations and creating scale efficiencies. In India, trends increased relative to the first quarter, with 11% revenue growth and 8% transaction growth. We still have some negative impact in the quarter on transactions and revenue from the Ivory Coast in Libya. Ivory Coast agent started to reopen about midway to the quarter, while Libya is still almost entirely shut down. Egypt was opened throughout the quarter. In the Gulf States, our growth rate improved from the first quarter. ", "Turning to the Americas region. Revenue increased 5% on transaction growth of 7%. Domestic money transfer continues to have strong momentum, with revenue growth of 9% on transaction growth of 19% in the quarter. Mexico continues to be challenging, as revenue increased 1%, while transactions declined 1%. Midway through the quarter, we began to pilot some new pricing from the U.S. to Mexico to test different levels of price elasticity in consumer usage. The tests include adding a $5 for $50 promotion, a mix of other -- and a mix of other different value propositions. It is too early to make any conclusions, but initially, we have seen some positive transaction lift and relatively neutral impact on revenue. The tests are ongoing and we will continue to tweak the model based on consumer reaction. One positive impact we are seeing is some shifts from Next Day to Money in Minutes, as we have reduced the price difference between the 2. ", "In the Asia-Pacific region, results remained strong, with revenue growth of 16% on a 12% increase in transactions. There was good growth across the region, with acceleration in Australia and China. China posted increases of 13% on revenue and 7% on transactions. For the overall C2C business, the spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter narrowed to 1 percentage point, excluding the impact of currency, which had a 3-point benefit. Mix was neutral in the quarter and the impact of pricing was 1%. For the full year, we now expect price decreases to be between 1% and 2%, as fee reductions are slightly smaller than planned and there are some offset by modest increases in FX spreads in some corridors. For the next couple of years, we expect net price decreases to be in the range of 1% to 3%, but we are constantly evaluating elasticity dynamics in the different corridors, and we will only implement where we think we can drive additional revenue over time.", "Moving to the Global Business Payments. The overall segment revenue increased 4%. The Bill Payment business turned positive, with revenue increasing 2%, as continued strong international growth increases in U.S. electronic payments and moderating declines in U.S. cash payments drove the improvement. Western Union Business Solutions revenue increased 14%, remains on track for mid-teen revenue growth for the year.", "Turning to margins. The second quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 25.7%, which compares to 24.4% in 2010. Excluding restructuring charges, the consolidated operating margin was 26.3% in this year's second quarter compared to 27.1% in the prior year. The current quarter includes $6 million of deal costs related to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments. Currency translation aided revenue by approximately $32 million, but negatively impacted operating margins. As a reminder, the strengthening of the European currencies favorably impacts revenue, but has a less significant impact on operating profit due to the company's hedging programs. As we stated at the beginning of the year, a 5% movement in the European currencies would impact revenue by approximately $55 million on a full year basis but would only impact operating profit by about $7 million. ", "The second quarter operating margin, excluding restructuring expenses, declined approximately 80 basis points from the same period last year, as the negative currency impact, higher spending on initiatives and Travelex costs offset operating efficiencies, including restructuring savings and revenue leverage. We recorded $9 million of restructuring expenses in the quarter related to our previously announced programs. Approximately $500,000 of expense is included in cost of services and $8.4 million is in SG&A. This compares to $35 million in restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2010. These charges are not included in our segment operating results. ", "For the full year, we now expect approximately $45 million of pretax restructuring charges, which is slightly lower than our previous estimate of approximately $50 million. We continue to expect approximately $50 million related savings for the year and $70 million in 2012. We realized $30 million of savings from restructuring activities in the quarter. We recorded a $29 million gain in other income and expense in the quarter. This gain reflects the remeasurement of our previous 30% equity interest in Angelo Costa upon closing of the acquisition. ", "The tax rate in the quarter was 21.1%, or 21.4% excluding the impacts of the restructuring charges, which compares to 18.8%, or 20.7% excluding restructuring charges in the second quarter of last year. Our full year estimated tax rate is now in a range of 23% to 24%, down from our previous range of 24% to 25%, primarily due to the resolution of certain foreign tax matters. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.41, or $0.42 excluding restructuring charges. GAAP EPS was $0.33 in the second quarter of last year, or $0.36 excluding restructuring charges. ", "Our C2C segment operating margin in the quarter was 28.6% compared to 29.1% in the same period last year. The decrease was due to the impact of currency and higher spending on initiatives, which offset other efficiencies, including restructuring savings and revenue leverage. Global Business Payments operating margins was 19.9% in the quarter, which compared to 18.9% in the second quarter of 2010. The margin improved compared to last year, primarily due to revenue increases, restructuring savings and lower integration and investment spending in Western Union Business Solutions. We continue to expect Business Solutions to be non-dilutive to earnings for the full year. ", "Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $506 million, and capital expenditures were $75 million. Our year-to-date depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $90 million. At quarter end, the company had total debt of $3.6 billion and cash of $2.1 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion was outside the United States. In the quarter, we spent $135 million to repurchase 6.6 million shares or 1% of the total shares outstanding at an average price of $20.35. We also paid $50 million in quarterly dividends. As of June 30, we have $755 million remaining under our stock repurchase authorization, which expires on December 31, 2012. Also, as of June 30, our basic shares outstanding were 627.5 million shares. We continue to manage our capital structure to target an A- credit rating. ", "Turning to our expectations for the full year. We are raising the outlook for both revenue and earnings per share. In revenue, our outlook now calls for constant currency revenue growth in a range of 4% to 5%, and GAAP revenue growth in a range of 5% to 6%. This compares to our previous outlook of 3% to 4% constant currency growth, with no impact from foreign exchange. Constant currency revenue is benefiting from better-than-expected revenue per transaction, driven by higher principal per transaction and slightly lower pricing reductions than originally forecast. We have also changed our currency assumptions to reflect current foreign exchange outlooks around the globe. As an example, we are now projecting the euro in the lower 1.40s, compared to the low 1.30s in our February and April outlook. Our outlook does not include any revenue from Travelex Global Business Payments, which is expected to close late this year. For earnings per share, the new outlook is GAAP EPS in a range of $1.48 to $1.53, and EPS excluding restructuring charges of $1.53 to $1.58. The 2011 projected GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.07 compared to our previously stated outlook. And the EPS range, excluding restructuring expenses, has increased by $0.06. Restructuring expenses are now slightly lower than expected at $45 million, down from approximately $50 million previously. ", "Excluding restructuring expenses, there are 4 primary drivers of the $0.06 increase in EPS. First, there's a $0.02 per share positive impact from the increase in constant currency revenue. Second, there's a $0.01 positive impact from the additional 1% increase in GAAP revenue due to currency translation, net of a partial offset from hedges. Third, there is a $0.01 positive impact from acquisition activity not included in the April outlook. And finally, the current outlook reflects a positive $0.02 impact from a 1% reduction in expected tax rate range. The current range is 23% to 24%, which is down from the prior range of 24% to 25%. The $0.01 acquisition impact is derived from the combination of Angelo Costa, Finint and Travelex. We are projecting a $0.02 benefit from an anticipated second half gain on our previous 30% ownership position in Finint and a $0.01 higher-than-expected benefit from Angelo Costa acquisition. These benefits are partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from the deal costs related to Travelex. Other than the impact of the Travelex deal costs and the negative impact of foreign exchange, our operating margin outlook remains similar to the April outlook. ", "The current GAAP operating margin outlook is in a range of 25% to 25.5%, including Travelex deal costs of approximately $15 million. Operating margins, excluding restructuring charges, are now projected at a range of 26% to 26.5%. On a constant currency basis, these margins are projected at 26.5% to 27%, including the Travelex deal costs. We are still projecting full year marketing expense similar to last year at approximately 4% of revenue. However, our second half timing will differ as we have extensive marketing plans for the third quarter. We expect marketing expense to be around 5% in this year's third quarter compared to about 3.7% in 2010 and then to be lower in the fourth quarter. Consequently, our fourth quarter operating margins are projected to be higher than the third quarter. The gains from the Angelo Costa and Finint are recorded in other income and therefore, not included in operating margins. GAAP cash flows from operating activities are expected to be at the lower end of our previous range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the year. Compared to 2010, operating cash flows are being negatively impacted by changes in working capital. ", "Two factors are impacting the working capital comparison. First, in 2011, we will spend the major portion of the cash relating to the restructuring charges incurred in both years. The cash outflows associated with almost half -- the cash outflows associated with almost all the 2011 restructuring charges of $45 million and over half of the 2010 restructuring charges of $60 million will be paid in 2011. The second item impacting working capital relates to an inflow in 2010 that will not reoccur to the same extent in 2011. Specifically, we realized a significant cash inflow in 2010 relating to closing out interest rate swaps when we completed our debt exchange in the first quarter of last year. Also, as a reminder, the gains recorded on Costa and Finint in 2011 are noncash items. In 2012, we do not expect to be impacted by these working capital items, as payments from restructuring activities will be largely complete by the end of this year. ", "In summary, we are comfortable increasing our full year revenue and earnings per share outlook based on our first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. We will continue to execute against our strategies, deploy cash against investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and share buyback and dividends and target a strong balance sheet. ", "Operator, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just on the guidance range and the raise there, I'm happy to see that, obviously, there's a lot of words out there about Europe. I'm just curious, Hikmet or Scott, what gives you the confidence that Europe is not going to get worse and potentially impact the guidance here? I'm wondering if PSD alone is enough to carry through any negative surprises in the region.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Tien-Tsin, if you look at Europe, I think we are very pleased with the numbers. I mean Germany is doing very well. Russia and France are also doing very well. Being in all countries in Europe, being in -- and actually being in 200 countries worldwide give us the comfort that every country has their own dynamics. And generally, we are pretty well positioned in Europe. There are always some issues in some countries. But I would say, our position is very well in Europe and we are growing the business. There will be different -- in different countries, different dynamics, but I would say that we are very well positioned in Europe. And regarding PSD, it's not only PSD -- I mean, as you know, we have PSD locations and we are comfortable with our outlook, 1% additional incremental revenue coming from PSD. We have about 3,500 locations active there and their productivity is quite high. They do good revenue. But we have also, post offices and the banks and we are expanding our presence. We recently signed also Banca Intesa Sanpaolo with ATM transactions where customers can go to an ATM and send money from the ATM or from their accounts. So I think Europe is pretty well.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Very good. This is my quick follow-up, the Bill Payment business that did turn up. I think, as you suggested last quarter -- the question that I have is, is this fix permanent, meaning is the growth sustainable here going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well I think, as I mentioned previously, the team is doing good, signing new billers. We do have the right marketing activities on place. Definitely, economic environment always helps us, right? But we started to diversify our billers and we see the first impact here. Now it's early to say, how -- I will be cautiously optimistic here, Tien-Tsin. I think we see early signs the team is doing great job, and so it's good.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet, I wanted to get your thoughts on the prepaid market. Obviously, it continues to evolve and the new rules that are in place will obviously have banks make different decisions. And I'm wondering how Western Union will evolve its prepaid business in this changing environment?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think if you look at our prepaid business cards, as I said before, we are in the U.S. only, a little bit of, what, a year active, right? We have about 1.1 million cards, and we have 12,000 locations. Now our sales could be better. We were estimating about -- doubling our card numbers than last year, but the activities on the cards are pretty good. So we are assuming 1% of our revenue will come from prepaid cards. Now our activities in the U.S. will continue. We will be having -- getting new retail sales here, but I also see opportunity in international. Next one is definitely the U.K., the team is focused to expand our prepaid activities in the U.K., our stored value, and other countries to come. But it's a market and market initiative and it takes some time to put your interest in the market, to understand the market and grow into market. And it has to be a good profitable business and we are focused where we do good revenue growth and similar profit margins that we have in our core business.", "Scott Scheirman", "And Kartik, the only thing I would add is that from a consumer value proposition, we're very focused on being fee-friendly and with the strength of the brand in the distribution, not only U.S., but globally. We believe on a long-term basis that, that's a winning combination for us.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then, just as a follow-up, on the C2C side, Scott, you said higher spending initiative. Does that mean just price reduction? And what could those initiatives means to C2C margins for 2011?", "Scott Scheirman", "Overall, for -- on a consolidated basis, we're calling for margins to be up in 2011 compared to 2010, excluding the restructuring charges. Specifically, in the third quarter, we're going to spend some more money on not marketing. So the margins in the third quarter will be a little bit lower, but margins will be higher in the fourth quarter. But really making investments to drive the top line growth as we move forward. Keep in mind, on a full year basis, Kartik, the marketing spend will be about 4% of our top line, which is generally consistent with 2010. But overall, we're on pace to expand our margins on a consolidated basis in 2011.", "Michael Salop", "And Kartik, we had higher spending in our initiatives factored into our original outlook. So it's really when you're looking at change right now, it's only just currency that's negatively impacting the margins.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And so -- it sounds like higher spending initiatives means more marketing, not price reductions, is that the right conclusion?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, I would say it would be around marketing, other investments we make. As you may recall on pricing, the original outlook had pricing in that 2% to 3% range and now we're closer to a 1% to 2% range. So it's not more pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "First question on the margin front, again, just the business segment, the Global Payments segment, obviously, had a very nice pickup on the margin. Is that, first of all, associated with the bill pay strength and the mix from that? And it sounds like -- you're at least cautiously optimistic that would be sustainable. So obviously, that should be impactful to the margin as well?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes, things that are helpful to that margin. We're pleased with it being at 20%, if you will. It's up from the prior year and up from the first quarter, too. Clearly, having 4% top line growth on Global Business Payments and then purely, the bill pay business had 2% top line growth. So that is helpful from that standpoint. We did have some restructuring savings and then some of the integration and investment spending in the Western Union Business Solutions has come in a little bit lower, if you will, as we anniversary some things there. So overall, we're pleased with a 20% margin. And clearly, that's up from where we were at a low point in the fourth quarter.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Right. And so if you think about that margin going forward, and that being somewhat sustainable ideally -- I mean, the C2C margin was obviously, impacted a lot by currency. First of all, what was the actual currency? I don't know if you said already, the currency impact specifically on this quarter's margin?", "Scott Scheirman", "We didn't provide a specific number but how I'd have you think about it is, we recorded a $32 million in, I'll call it, additional revenue because of currency translation. But the profit impact on that was significantly less. The full year metric, I would give you, Darrin, is back to the 5% movement in European currency is $55 million of revenue, $7 million of profit. So the margin on that analogy is about only 13%.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Right. Now just because, I mean, all-in, Scott, I mean, you have 26.5% to 27% constant currency margin guidance for the year, which is pretty similar to what the guidance you had before. Obviously, the impact, I would think, is mostly the 30 basis points or so from Travelex deal costs. And so theoretically, if you added back Travelex, you'd have about a 26.8% to over 20% -- 27% margin guidance for the year and I would imagine some of that's just benefit from the strength you're seeing again, finally, in the bill pay segment being a positive.", "Scott Scheirman", "The bill payment has definitely been helpful. And then I agree with your math, if you will, that what's impacting the full year margin is the -- roughly the 30 basis points or $15 million from the Travelex deal costs.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, Darrin, the math you put together is right on.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Great. And then just one more follow-up, if you don't mind. The spread between the transaction growth and revenue growth looks pretty good. I mean, international transaction growth was 5% at constant currency revenue growth, 5%. It looks like the spread between the 2 is tightened than -- versus prior quarters. I think you alluded to pricing being about a 1% to 2% adverse impact. I mean, is this less of a better environment from a pricing standpoint than, I think, you've seen in the past?", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, please standby.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Look, I was just trying to get some color on the pricing environment. Obviously, it looks like it's turning in the right direction based on the spread, and I think you alluded to about a 1% to 2% adverse impact on pricing. Is that -- is it a better environment now than it's been in the past? I mean, is it fair to say that? I mean, you said, 1% to 3% going forward. Can you just comment there real quickly?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure, Darrin. I mean, we stated 1% to 3% going forward. We do have a -- the pricing is a little bit seasonality, competition, geographical mix, and we currently see that we will -- for the full year, 1% to 2%, where we feel comfortable. We continue to gain market share with that, and we're going to continue to pricing investments, 1% to 3%, where we gain long-term revenue growth. So that will continue.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital", "Okay, all right. And just if you don't mind, last question on the buyback front, you had a nice first quarter with 500-plus million share -- dollars worth of buy back. Second quarter, I guess, had an adverse impact -- or you couldn't do as much because of the Travelex deal, still that over $100 million, should we expect a nice sort of aggressive buyback to continue now that the Travelex announcement came? And I'll leave you with that.", "Scott Scheirman", "No, Darrin, this is Scott. We believe investing in our stock, if you will, is a good investment and you're familiar with our capital allocation policies of investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. So we will continue to be active in doing that. Through December of '12, we have roughly $750 million authorized, so we'll continue to look forward to both investing in the business and returning cash to our shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Two quick questions. First, Scott, in your upgraded guidance for this year, are you including the $0.03 second quarter gain in other income?", "Scott Scheirman", "Yes. Half of that is included in that. At the beginning of February when we originally gave the outlook, David, we felt Costa would have a net $0.01 positive impact to the full year. Now we believe it's a net $0.02 positive impact. So it's really about a $0.03 gain offset by about $0.01 of integration and other costs related to that deal.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "And that's just from the mark-up of your stake from -- your initial stake from buying out the rest of it?", "Scott Scheirman", "Correct. Under the GAAP accounting rules, when we went from a 30% ownership to 100% ownership, the GAAP rules requires a revaluation of that 30% interest, which generated approximately a $29 million gain in the second quarter on a pretax basis.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.", "I see. And just a quick follow-up on capital allocation. Following the Travelex deal, can you give us a sense of what your dividend policy will be for 2012?", "Scott Scheirman", "We continue to want to be balanced in returning our cash to shareholders. I think over the last 12 months, you've seen us do a couple of dividend increases so periodically, the management team will review that. We'll spend time with our board, but our aim would be continue to return capital to our shareholders through buyback, but also -- and it aims towards as the business performs, ideally, increasing the dividend, but we'll have to wait and see as we move through that. But we clearly, want to balance the payback to the shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "My first question is, Scott, you mentioned, obviously, operating cash flow at the lower end of the prior range. Can you talk about the -- and that's primarily due to -- or a big factor there is the higher cash restructuring, can you talk about the forward-looking benefit from the 2 sets of restructuring? What should we expect for that on margins?", "Scott Scheirman", "Was the question on the margins, Ashwin?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "Yes, with regards to the -- specifically forward-looking benefit of the restructuring.", "Scott Scheirman", "Sure. Absolutely. Just to recap, the P&L benefit from the restructuring will be about $50 million of savings in 2011, and that, that will annualize a run rate into about $70 million into 2012. Our objective, as a management team, is to expand our margins as we move forward. We believe we've got a business model that we can drive leverage with growth in revenue, 65% of our costs are fixed, 35% are variable, so the revenue leverage, if you will, the restructuring savings or productivity savings will be helpful. And then, probably a little bit of offset there with investing in the business to grow it. But clearly, as a management team, our objective is to grow our margins.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc", "Right. And speaking of those investments and the impact that can have on market share gain, the market share gain of 50 basis points in 2010, obviously, a good number, the historical number has been more closer, I guess, to 100 basis points, if I'm not mistaken. Can you reaccelerate that with all the investments you're making, and specifically, what areas?", "Scott Scheirman", "That would be our objective, is to continue to gain market share and gain market share at an accelerated pace and where we've been making investments is both in the core business, but also investing behind electronic channels where we think there's a little bit of a different customer segment there with westernunion.com, account-based money transfer and mobile phone money transfer. So we believe there's opportunities, not only to grow the retail channels, but we're adding PSD locations in Europe, banks in the U.S. but then moving forward with the initiatives in the electronic channels, too. So hopefully, all those things with the objective, is to gain share at an increased pace.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I think -- just to add on that. With all these new channels and with all our initiatives, we are not growing and gaining market share only on our core money transfer and core customer segment, but we are gaining new customer segments with electronic channels. And also, with our B2B activities now, combining business solutions with Travelex, we are really entering some new customer segment. There's a need, and I think there will be a growth here also, so I'm very excited about the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kissane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Scott, I thought your pricing comments were very positive. Can you point to some of the regions where pricing is more favorable that's offsetting some of the pressure in Mexico?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, if you look at our business being 16,000 corridors and none of the countries are bigger out of the U.S., bigger than 6%. It's really differentiates from country to country and from bank to bank, actually within the thing. The beauty of our business, the beauty of our management is that we are really managing 16,000 pricing actions actually within the different banks. So I think it differentiates from country to country, from corridor to corridor. The good stable growth in the European business, we do increase. In the Gulf States, Gulf States start coming back are also in the receiving center are China and India business are growing double digit. So I think we are doing -- we really react to the market needs and the environment -- on the competitive environment.", "James Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And any comment on trends in C2C commissions? And if you look back, has integrating FEXCO helped C2C margins and as you look forward, the impact that Angelo Costa and Finint will have you integrate those?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, yes. I think we are very focused on the margin side, on the commission side, both we have now direct access with the PSD, direct to the sub-agents and I think that will help out also our long-term or our commission rates. And as you look at our agent negotiations, it has -- end of date has to be a win-win situation though, right? Agents have to win and we have to win. But we look at our position being in so many countries and having so many agents. I think we are in a very good position that having favorable commissions for Western Union.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "So it's nice to see some of the global economic trends creating a bit of a tailwind for your business, namely the principal per transaction, whereas transaction volume growth is held kind of steady. Should we think about this as kind of a cyclical or macroeconomic kind of evolution whereby you see the principal increase first and then the transaction volume follows? Or how are you thinking about the sustainability of transaction growth over the -- or the potential for acceleration over the next several quarters?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I wouldn't say that -- it's hard to make a global formula out of it. It really differentiates from region to region, from country to country, right? We do see in some regions higher revenue per transaction activities, that the consumer confidence increase some sent countries. But on other sent countries, I think to say the transactions are stable and revenue of our transaction is still the same. If you want to put it in a global formula, we do see revenue per transaction increase, which makes us -- we are very pleased on that, right? And also, as I mentioned earlier, on the pricing investment, we are probably going to have 1% to 2% pricing investment this year instead of 2% to 3%. So these are good signs. Though the economic state is challenging, I'm not seeing a big change on the economic environment globally. I think the management is very focused despite the economic -- continued economic challenges. The marketing activities on the market is pretty well to respond to the customer needs.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, I thought the Regions deal was a particularly important one on 2 fronts, both the expedited bill pay piece. I'm wondering if you can just comment on the competitive environment there. And then also, in terms of potentially turning on account-to-cash, can you just give us a sense of where you are in that product in the U.S.? Should we start to see more banks kind of initiate account-to-cash solutions powered by Western Union in the back half of '11 as we look out into '12?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I would say, long term, yes, definitely, Andrew. You will see that not only powered by Western Union, I think it's branded by Western Union that we are growing. But we did -- we have these activities now globally. We have about 60 banks, 30 of them we activated to make account-based transaction and each win is definitely -- the Regions Bank, and I believe with the our banking, U.S. banking strategy, we will get more banks. We have more banks in line to get them, starting with the retail money transfer and working on allocation and doing transaction, adding also account-based money transfer to give convenience to the consumers. It's definitely something we did with the U.S. Bank, and now the Regions Bank is online and other banks is to follow.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Two questions. The first one, just going back to the pricing commentary. Is there, in your opinion, just sort of tie that into the competitive dynamic and the 16,000 corridors that you manage? Are you seeing anything on the competitive front that maybe gives you more confidence in terms of managing pricing and maybe not having to discount as much as you would have thought when the year started, the competitive position has improved to that degree or competitors have weakened more than you have thought?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I would say, competition is still on the market and that has got to keep us fit. Probably, our reaction are being more intelligent, more closer to the market to give us the capability to adapt our pricing and being active in the market and that's why we are gaining market share. As I mentioned before, Aite just came out with the recent statistics and it looks like we, again, gained about 0.5% market share versus 2009. So these are good news. Generally, competition is here, continuous, especially the corridors, especially start active also brand is one. But in different corridors, we have very strong competition. However, people start to understand, being in 200 countries, as you mentioned, and having 470,000 locations, you can send from one point to 16,000 corridors immediately money. I think nobody can match that, delivering in 470,000 locations. So this gives us definitely an advantage, competitive advantage, and we are going to grow this brand, network, electronic channel. I think we have a good position to be more active and being competitive price.", "Scott Scheirman", "And I would add, it's always been a competitive environment out there, Tim. We continue to gain share, as Hikmet mentioned, and pricing, as we do pricing, it's one of the drivers we look at to gain share, promoting the brand, adding locations or distribution and differentiating the product. And then, as we do pricing, what we think about is pricing elasticity, what's the best thing to do to maximize long-term revenue growth and customers coming back to the franchise.", "Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. And then my follow-up was just around the tax rate. As we think about the slightly lower tax rate this year, is it something structurally and sort of your profit mix in your tax strategy that we should think about that flowing through in the out years? Or would this be just sort of an '11 type tax rate when we consider our models for '12 and '13?", "Scott Scheirman", "Two comments on that, Tim. One is, I would say, this one item is more of an '11 item, if you will. We resolved certain international tax items, so we were -- have somewhat of a small favorable benefit, expect a small favorable benefit in '11. Although, as we think about the tax rate on the longer-term basis, that as the international business, which I believe will grow faster than the U.S. business, the international profits are generally taxed at a lower rate, so that will be somewhat helpful to our tax rate on a long-term basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Meghna Ladha of Susquehanna.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Meghna Ladha - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "So in general, Hikmet, what do you see as the 2 or 3 key levers to manage your margins? And how should we balance these initiatives versus growth post 2011?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, I'm definitely looking for a long-term margin increase. And I think our business model is built for that. The revenue growth, obviously, helps to increase the margin. The top line is the best indicator for that, and we are very much focused for the growth. Given our core money transfer business is growing, given also our initiatives on the SME business with the growth opportunities for the future, I believe that's the one thing. The other thing is, we are also focused on our commission rates, right? Agent commission rates, which are very low costs and we do look at long term, long relationships with the agents and having a favorable commission rates for both -- [indiscernible] for both but favorable for Western Union given our global presence. And the third one is, Scott can give you a little bit more color on that, is our fixed cost structure. I think we are also pretty much focused on this -- our processes, our initiatives, we have corporate initiatives to focus on our fixed costs. We have operating centers globally, we have people, very effective people in a very cost friendly environment. So these are the major initiatives. Anything, Scott?", "Scott Scheirman", "No, just to add, it's really growing the top line revenue as Hikmet mentioned. 65% of the costs are variable, 35% are fixed, so we have a natural way to move margins up there. And then, one of our key strategies is improving our processes and productivity. And over the long term, we believe there's additional opportunities to create efficiencies, even further improve customer satisfaction and get to highly efficient and effective processes that we believe will be helpful on a go-forward basis.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "This is actually Roman Leal sitting in for Julio. The first question on -- which is kind of on pricing, what specifically motivates you to introduce that pricing initiative in Mexico versus other corridors? Does it make sense to introduce that elsewhere around the globe? And how much of that is kind of baked into your 1% to 3% pricing kind of guidance for the next few years?", "Hikmet Ersek", "On the pricing initiative, generally, we really look market by market. I wouldn't draw a global rollout of it at 5 -- introducing $5 for $50 in one market, implements also by other markets. Don't forget also is that the $5 for $50 in some currencies, some different than dollar currencies. So I believe there are certain customer segment, which we do look corridor by corridor and understand the environment. So I would say that, the pricing initiative, 1% to 2% is for 2011, and we do keep the flexibility on an investment, 1% to 3% long term to understand the environment.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And on prepaid, I know you mentioned you're kind of progressing nicely here with some potential partnerships. Are you looking more for -- to expand your current locations? Or is this perhaps something where you could -- you can push more aggressively to open your reload network to third-party prepaid for managers?", "Hikmet Ersek", "In the U.S., we currently have about 12,000 locations and some of the locations are -- have exclusivity with the competition, that's why we are kind of locked to expand our distribution. But when time comes we're going to get some also on our distribution channels to sell more cards. Generally, I would say, that I'm very open to reload the cards. Our network is ideal. Also, international, I believe, given the 470,000 locations. We are in a very well position to sell more cards than -- load more cards and be active with more cards. ", "Okay. I just wanted to say thank you for all questions, and I would like to summarize the quarter. And seeing -- if we summarize the quarter, you'll see that our business is solid and we are very comfortable to raise our revenue and earnings per share outlook at this time for 2011. Longer term, we have continue -- have opportunities to grow our core money transfer business, both in cash, retail money transfer and electronic channels. And also, the pending acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments, combining with Western Union Business Solutions, will give us a very strong second leg to expand to new customer segments. And we will continue to be active returning funds back to the shareholders through share repurchase and through dividends. So thank you very much.

On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss 2011 fourth quarter and full year performance, and our 2012 outlook.

And welcome, everyone. Overall, 2011 was a good year and we realized many accomplishments. We exceeded our earnings per share outlook from the beginning of the year and delivered our highest full-year revenue rate since 2008. This was accomplished in a challenging environment that included the Arab Spring, economic troubles in Europe and high global unemployment. ", "We believe that we gained cross-border market share, each of our consumer-to-consumer regions grew and the repositioning of our U.S. domestic money transfer business, which began in late 2009, continue to pay off. ", "We advanced our European strategy of being closer to the consumers and optimizing our operating model by completing the Angelo Costa and Finint super-agent acquisitions. In Asia, we've further expanded our network and now have approximately 200,000 locations across China, India and the rest of APAC. With our bank license, we also laid the groundwork for expansion in Brazil and continued the turnaround in consumer bill payments.", "In business-to-business payments, we completed the Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition in November, which gives us a strong foundation for a second leg of growth well into the future. Within C2C, our electronic channels business continue to advance in 2011 with 35% revenue growth, indicating that our combination of physical network with digital send and receive options is matching consumer needs in the marketplace. ", "We also signed a global prepaid and money transfer agreements with MasterCard, which will help us globalize prepaid services and allow us to leverage MasterCard's world-class global electronic network. Late in the year, we began our launch of prepaid cards in Europe. ", "Other accomplishments in 2011 include completion of the restructuring activities we announced in mid- 2010, which delivered approximately $55 million in cost savings. And also, we resolved our international tax position with the IRS.", "We also maintained strong cash deployment in 2011. In addition to the acquisition, we repurchased $800 million of shares and paid almost $200 million in dividends. So 2011 was a great year. ", "As we enter 2012, we are expecting near-term challenges, driven largely by economic conditions. I've just returned from the world economic Davos where I had the chance to talk to many business leaders, and the general expectation is Europe will be challenging in 2012.", "Our business has held up well in countries such as the U.K., France and Germany. However, Italy and other parts of the Southern Europe have softened. We also will face some challenges in Mexico and Russia in 2012 as we adjust our strategies in these countries.", "But our focuses on execution and positioning the company for future growth, we have defined our long-term opportunities and growth strategies, and now we must execute successfully against them.

There are many other types of underserved customers that could benefit from the services we offer. Examples include students who need to make some tuition payments in foreign currency; travelers who need cash; and small businesses that make cross-border payments.", "Last year, we organized our business around 3 key growth areas: first, global consumer financial services, which include core money transfer; second, new ventures and services, which includes expansion of our electronic channels; and third, business-to-business payments.", "We now have a strategic roadmap in place that will allow us to accelerate our businesses over the next several years.

I would like to spend a few minutes talking about each of these areas. ", "In core money transfer, over the next 2 years, we want to transition from being a transaction-based to becoming a truly customer-centric organization with added convenience and more choice. We have a long-term vision for the core business of 1 million agent locations, further market share increases and margin improvement from growth and efficiencies. ", "Over time, we want to further increase loyalty by continuing to improve the retail experience with simple, high-quality transactions at the right value. We want to increase share of wallet by leveraging our consumer database and providing access to new services. And we want to add new consumers through expanding our network with strategic agents and offering adjacent services, such as account-based money transfer, direct-to-bank or card, ATM money transfer and intra-services in key markets.

Last year, we created an internal team that took a deep dive study of our digital efforts and the market opportunity. In 2011, our digital base revenues from westernunion.com and mobile were over $100 million. I asked the team to build a long-term roadmap on how to achieve true leadership and scale in electronic channels.", "At the core of this roadmap is creating a separate digital business that will give us the dedicated focus and expertise. We have placed this business in San Francisco and are building a team, combining strong internal expertise and external digital talent. We are also investing in technology to redesign the consumer experience, offer multiple funding and receive options and optimize risk mitigation.", "Importantly, having a strong digital offering will allow us to add new customers, consumer who want to make account-to-account payments or transfers will be able to use our services. There's also significant portion of the remittance market that is run to account-based solutions and historically, this type of consumers has utilized bank transfer options.

Transaction fee revenue increased 2%, while foreign exchange revenue grew 20%, primarily due to the acquisition of Travelex.", "In the Consumer-to-consumer segment, reported revenue increased 3%, with transaction fee revenue up 2% and foreign exchange revenue up 6%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was 3% as compared to 4% in the third quarter, while transaction growth was 5%, the same as the third quarter.", "While we have revenue growth in each region, revenue trends were affected by the slowdown in Southern Europe as well as business challenges in Mexico, Russia and China. C2C cross-border principal grew 2% in the quarter or 3% on a constant currency basis. C2C principal per transaction declined 2% year-over-year or 1% on a constant currency basis. In the international C2C business, revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. International transaction growth was 5%.", "International principal per transaction declined 1% compared to the prior year on both a reported and constant currency basis. We ended the year with approximately 485,000 agent locations. This was the same number at the end of the third quarter because we closed approximately 15,000 inactive or lower activity Vigo agent locations in Russia and CIS countries. ", "Turning to the regions. Our C2C business in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region increased revenue at 2% and transactions at 3%. The revenue growth rate was down slightly from the third quarter due to currency and further challenges in Russia and Southern Europe, primarily Italy.", "As we mentioned in the third quarter, in Russia, we are losing business to retail-based competitors. We have action plans in place to counter this, but they will take time to implement, and we expect Russia to be a challenge throughout 2012.", "In addition to the economic situation in Southern Europe, new regulation in Italy are also impacting the business. Despite the headlines, other large markets in Europe, such as the U.K., France and Germany, held up well, and the Gulf States delivered good growth.", "In India, revenue growth remained strong at 12% and transaction growth increased to 15%. For the full year, the EMEASA operating margin was 28.7%, a 30 basis point increase from 2010.", "Turning to the Americas region. Revenue increased 3% on steady transaction growth of 6%. Although not as strong as third quarter, domestic money transfer continues to have solid momentum with revenue growth of 7% on transaction growth of 11% in the quarter.", "Mexico revenue declined 1%, while transactions increased 1% in the quarter. Our Mexico business continues to be affected by ongoing compliance procedures related to our southwest border agreement.", "In 2012, we will be evolving our business model and practices related to Mexico. We're in the process of renewing agent agreements and changing how we operate in Mexico, including further compliance-related changes. As a result of these factors, we expect our Mexico business to decline in 2012, as we modify the business.

Australia delivered good growth, but not as strong as the third quarter, while the Philippines delivered similar growth to the third quarter.", "In China, revenue declined 5% in the quarter, while transactions increased 1%. China was affected by currency controls or other restrictions implemented in certain countries in Africa and Latin America, which impacted high principal outbound activity from these countries to China.", "The Asia-Pacific operating margin for 2011 was 28% compared to 28.7% in 2010. For the C2C business overall, the spread between transaction revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points.

In fact, over 30% of our U.K. to Kenya transactions are now sent to a mobile phone. Also, our mobile apps for the iPhone and Android are gaining traction as access to points to westernunion.com.", "In prepaid, we ended the year with nearly 1.5 million cards in force, and retail distribution at over 15,000 U.S. locations.

In total, prepaid, including third-party top up, represented just under 1% of company revenue for the year.", "Moving to Global Business Payments. Overall segment revenue increased 24% in the quarter, including $35 million in revenue from Travelex. Western Union Business Solutions reported revenue growth of 13%, excluding the acquisition. The consumer bill payment business continued its steady improvement, with revenue increasing 2%, led by strong international growth. U.S. revenue trends were similar to the third quarter.", "Turning to margins. The fourth quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 25.0%, which compares to 23.7% or 24.5%, excluding restructuring expenses in the prior year.", "The improvement is primarily due to revenue leverage, restructuring savings, Durbin and lower marketing expense, partially offset by Travelex deal costs and intangibles amortization. Travelex results negatively impacted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points. This includes about $5 million of integration expense as we began integration in the quarter.", "In addition, there were $9 million in cost related to completion of the acquisition. Marketing expenses were 4.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to 5% in the prior year. Marketing for the year was consistent with 2010 at approximately 4% of revenue.", "There were no restructuring expenses in the quarter, as we completed all activities in the third quarter, and we realized approximately $19 million in restructuring savings in the quarter. As a reminder, restructuring charges are not included in our segment operating results.", "For the full year of 2011, GAAP operating margin of 25.2% is consistent with 2010 GAAP operating margin of 25.0%. Excluding restructuring charges, 2011 operating margin of 26.1% is also consistent with 2010 operating margin at 26.2% on the same basis.", "Excluding restructuring charges, the relatively consistent year-over-year margins of approximately 26% were a result benefits from restructuring savings and revenue leverage, offset by foreign exchange, spending on initiatives and acquisition-related costs.", "The company recorded a total of $47 million of restructuring charges in 2011. We realized approximately $55 million of related savings. We continue to expect approximately $70 million of savings in 2012.", "In 2010, we reported $60 million of restructuring expense with $8 million of savings. Our 2011 earnings per share include some nonrecurring gains in other income. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a gain of $20 million related to the revaluation of the company's previous ownership position in Finint, as we indicated earlier in the year. We also recorded a gain of $21 million on foreign currency forward contracts related primarily to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments. We entered into forward contracts to lock in the dollar volume of a portion of the anticipated purchase price, which generated a gain when the British pound appreciated. As a result of the forward contract gain, the overall impact of that Travelex acquisition on EPS was neutral in 2011, including the deal cost.", "For the full year, we reported $50 million of gains relating to the revaluation of ownership position in Angelo Costa and Finint, which were included in our last outlook, and we recorded the $21 million gain on foreign currency forward contracts related to the acquisition.", "The tax provision in the quarter reflects the benefit of approximately $205 million related to the agreement with the IRS, which was announced mid-December. We have previously established tax contingencies reserves over the last 8 years related to the restructuring of our international tax operations in 2003. As we resolve the appropriate tax treatment of the IRS, we agreed to make tax payments of approximately $200 million, which we anticipate as we made in 2012, in addition to the $250 million deposit we made in 2010. Since we have reserved at a higher level, we recorded a onetime noncash benefit of $205 million to our tax provision in the fourth quarter.", "Excluding the benefit, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.8%. This compares to an effective tax rate of approximately 23% on a year-to-date basis for September 30, as we had some international reserve increases and other items in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 25%, excluding the tax benefit related to the IRS agreement and the impact of restructuring expenses.", "Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.73 or $0.40 excluding the tax benefit. GAAP EPS was $0.37 in the fourth quarter of last year or $0.38 excluding restructuring charges. Earnings per share in the full year were $1.84 or $1.57 excluding the tax benefit and restructuring expenses. This compares to GAAP EPS of $1.36 or $1.42 excluding restructuring charges in 2010. Common shares outstanding as of 2011 year-end were 619 million.", "Our C2C segment operating margin in the quarter was 28.0% compared to 27.0% in the same period last year. The improvement was due to restructuring savings, revenue leverage and lower marketing spending. For the full year, C2C operating margin increased to 28.6% in 2011 from 28.4% in 2010, driven by the restructuring savings and revenue leverage, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and spending on initiatives.", "Global Business Payments' operating margin was 17.5% compared to 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The margin improved compared to last year primarily due to revenue increases, restructuring savings, the impact of lower debit processing expenses related to Durbin and lower integration and investment spending in Western Union Business Solutions. The reduction of debit fees due to Durbin is having a positive impact on our consumer bill payments margins, although it will negatively impact revenue in some cases as we pass through the savings.", "Full year Global Business Payments' operating margin increased from 17.0% in 2010 to 17.9% in 2011, driven by many of the same factors in the fourth quarter. Consumer bill payment margins improved slightly in 2011 compared to 2010.", "Moving to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our financial position remained strong. Cash flow from operations for the year was $1.2 billion and capital expenditures were $163 million. Capital expenditures were 3% of revenue for the year.

At year-end, the company had debt of $3.6 billion and cash of $1.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was outside the United States.", "As a result of the IRS agreement, we have been able to move additional cash back to the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we retired $700 million in maturing notes, which had already been replaced by issuances since earlier in the year.", "In the fourth quarter, we declared $50 million in quarterly dividend, which were paid on December 30. Consistent with our comments on our third quarter call, we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter, but plan to resume buyback activity in the first quarter. We had approximately $650 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization as of year-end.", "Now I'd like to review our outlook for 2012. In general, we're anticipating a more challenging economic situation this year. We saw some slowdowns in our C2C business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and expect similar growth rates in 2012. Our outlook assumes softness in Europe. In the Americas, we expect our U.S. outbound and domestic money transfer businesses to remain solid, but we're anticipating decline in Mexico, as we evolve our business model and compliance practices. ", "The C2C revenue outlook includes solid double-digit growth in electronic channels. In Business Solutions, we anticipate constant currency revenue to grow in the low double-digits on a pro-forma basis. Revenue from current business-to-business customers are impacted by movements in global trade, but we still anticipate strong new customer acquisition. Our bill payments business is expected to be steady, although reported revenues will be somewhat negatively impacted by Durbin pass-throughs.", "Overall, we expect constant currency revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% in 2012. This includes a 4 percentage point benefit from having a full year Travelex Global Business Payments revenues compared to approximately 2 months in 2011. We expect GAAP revenues to be approximately 2 percentage points lower than constant currency. As you are aware, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly compared to the 2011 average euro rate of approximately $1.40.", "As a reminder, we hedged the majority of our European profits, so currency movements have a larger impact on revenue than operating profit. Moving forward, we would expect any additional 5% move in the European currencies to have a full year impact to our 2012 outlook for approximately $55 million on revenue and approximately $6 million on operating profit.", "Our operating margins are expected to be similar to 2011 levels, including the negative impact of intangibles amortization from the Travelex acquisition. However, we do expect EBITDA margins to increase in 2012. We anticipate GAAP margins of approximately 25%, which compares to 25.2% in 2011.  Current year GAAP margins include approximately $50 million of integration expense from Travelex Global Business Payments, while prior year included $52 million of restructuring expenses and Travelex integration costs.", "Excluding Travelex integration costs, we expect 2012 operating margins of approximately 26%, which compares to 26.2% excluding restructuring expenses and Travelex integration costs in 2011. Items that are favorably impacting the margins include: revenue growth, currency hedges on European profits, Durbin, lower deal costs and approximately $15 million of additional restructuring savings. These benefits to margin are being offset primarily by increased amortization and incremental investments in the business.", "The acquisition-related intangibles amortization for Business Solutions will increase for approximately $20 million in 2011 to around $60 million in 2012 due to the Travelex acquisition. We also plan to build out our digital business, which is already well underway. From a P&L standpoint, we are investing about $35 million of incremental expense into this initiative in 2012, hiring talented digital employees, enhancing technology solutions and increasing consumer marketing. This will become new infrastructure and our goal is to create $0.5 billion-plus digital revenue business by 2015.", "We're also investing in network expansion, allocating additional funds to increase sales forces and to drive new accounts acquisition. As a result of all these factors, we expect essentially flat operating margins compared to 2011. Due to the increasing magnitude of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, we will also provide EBITDA metrics going forward. The EBITDA metric will reflect operating income with depreciation and amortization added back. All other income and expense is excluded from the metric. We expect 2012 EBITDA margin of approximately 30%, excluding the Travelex integration expenses. This compares to 29.6% in 2011, excluding Travelex integration costs and restructuring expenses.", "Our 2012 net other expense is expected to increase from 2011 due to the $71 million in non-reoccurring acquisition-related gains recorded last year. We expect an effective tax rate in the range of 16% to 17% in 2012, following our agreement with the IRS late last year on treatment of our international operations. This compares to an effective tax rate of 25% in 2011, excluding the tax benefit related to the IRS agreement and the impact of restructuring expenses.", "Bringing this all together, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 in 2012. GAAP EPS was $1.84 in 2011, aided by the onetime $205 million tax benefit. Our outlook calls for EPS, excluding Travelex integration costs, to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 compared to $1.57 in 2011, excluding restructuring expenses and the non-reoccurring tax benefit. The increase in 2012 is driven by revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the acquisition-related non-reocurring gains in 2011 and other income and expense.", "As mentioned, operating margins in 2012 are expected to be similar to 2011, as benefits are offsetting increased amortization and investments. We expect cash flow from operations in a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, excluding the anticipated tax payment of approximately $200 million to the IRS and state tax authorities related to the agreement announced in December. Our future cash flow is now expected to be roughly 65% international and 35% domestic, which reflects some standard repatriation each year. However, based on the IRS agreement and other factors, we also anticipate being able to bring back additional international cash to the U.S.", "Capital expenditures are anticipated to be 4% to 5% of revenue in 2012. This year, we anticipate a significant increase in signing bonuses on Asian contracts, as we have several major renewals, and we are aggressively pursuing new agents. We're also adding to investments in westernunion.com and new technology.", "Longer term, we expect capital spending to come back down to approximately 3% of revenue. We plan to continue to manage our capital structure to balance returns with strong credit ratings, while maintaining appropriate debt and cash level. At this time, we do not anticipate pursuing any sizable acquisition. However, we may continue to evaluate smaller acquisitions that support our growth strategies.", "Before opening the call to questions, I would also like to mention that in 2012, we would be evolving our segment reporting. We will maintain our consumer-to-consumer segment, but we'll now have separate segments for business-to-business and consumer bill payments, rather than the Global Business Payments segment.", "Within the C2C segment, we will provide metrics on 5 regions that align with our regional leadership team. The 5 regions are Europe and CIS, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, North America and Latin America. India and South Asia will be included in the Asia-Pacific region.", "Our prepaid and retail money order businesses will continue to be reported in the Other category. We'll provide restated comparisons for these changes, prior to our first quarter earnings release.", "To summarize, we believe 2011 was a good year, given the environment. We exceeded our initial EPS outlook for the year and recorded our highest annual revenue growth since 2008. We advanced our strategies, and we added a strong foundation for growth in business-to-business payments with the Travelex acquisition. We also successfully executed our restructuring and reached resolution with the IRS on our international tax position. Finally, we returned to $1 billion to shareholders, and today announced the 25% increase in our dividend.

Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Tien-Tsin here. I just wanted to clarify, on the margins, I heard the flat comment, but just wanted to confirm. Excluding the Travelex intangible amortization, margins will be up 40 bps including the investments. Did I hear that correct? And secondly, the digital investments you're making, what kind of growth do you expect that to drive in fiscal '12? I heard it's 3% of revenue now, but what could that look like this year?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Tien-Tsin, this is Scott. Let me address the EBITDA margins, then I'll turn it over to Hikmet for the .com for 2012 and forward, which we think can really grow very well. But on the EBITDA margins, 2011, we had an EBITDA margin of 29.6%, excluding restructuring charges and Travelex integration expenses, which were only about $5 million in 2011. In 2012, we expect EBITDA margins of 30%, which excludes the Travelex integration costs. So the EBITDA margins, we anticipate to increase in 2012.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, on the westernunion.com investment, Tien-Tsin, I believe that, that which the company does, and I think that's great, because we're already growing with our limited capabilities about 35% internationally, even 40%. What we do, what the other companies can't do, is that we are connecting the electronic channels with our retail, 485,000 locations, 200 countries. Not many companies have the capabilities to use the iPhone or use a computer to send in minute and payout in 485,000 locations. We believe with special focus within the branches, the team is working very hard in San Francisco, and we hire also digital talent there. We believe that we can grow this business to $500 million. Now it's to about $100 million, right, Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "$100 million. We can grow to $500 million by 2015.

And just, I guess thinking about the core including the digital piece, I guess you're targeting 2% to 4% growth, excluding the Travelex piece. And you did, I think, 4% growth in the fourth quarter and most of '11. So is that deceleration all just the Mexico and the Russia adjustments that you're making? What's your underlying assumptions, I suppose, here on the macro, to get to the 2% to 4%?", "Hikmet Ersek", "From the macro environment, I stay cautious in Europe. Parts of Europe is doing pretty well. I mean the north part of Europe, like Germany, U.K. and France, we are doing -- growing there very well. And but in the parts of Europe like Southern Europe, we do have some challenges. Here, we see some slowdown. Partly also, which -- in Russia, we do have a lower price competition there and the retail markets. And Mexico, we do have some southwest border compliance issue. We are upgrading there our compliance environment and also changing our business model. But from general environment, economic environment, I would say that I'm a little bit cautious on Europe, generally, but that showed also into Q4, the numbers has been a little bit slower than Q3.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Last one, I promise. Could the digital component add 100 bps to growth again in 2012 versus '11?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Well, we think it's got a lot of opportunity in digital. I won't get specific about '12, but we do expect strong double-digit revenue growth in digital. And we do think that could be a $0.5 billion business by 2015. So it's going to, for sure, add to the growth rates in 2012.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It will be, Tien-Tsin, and we have a roadmap to get to $0.5 billion, and we all feel confident about that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Sorry if I missed it, but the -- what's the goal for fiscal '12 marketing spend as a percent of revs? And you talked about these expansion efforts having more customer-centric view. That's a fine strategy. But I just want to know, what type of impact could this have on marketing spend over the long term. I mean, imagine it should increase, but the offsets possible from the electronic and mobile channels, how do you look at the moving parts there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I'll take the second part question of Glenn. If you like then, then Scott, you jump in, okay? I think from the digital strategy from the -- being customer focus is really putting the customer in the middle. And see digital as the fixed region besides our 5 region and sending from digital consumers to new -- to our -- sending money globally. I think what we are doing here is really connecting the digital with our network, 500,000 network. One site you have good funds from cards or from accounts, and sending cash globally, but also account -- the account is growing very fast in certain markets. We believe that's a huge opportunity also. Putting the customer in the middle, we don't believe that we need additional huge marketing investment. We already captured the customer. We're communicating to customers in a different way, but still, with our ethnic marketing we'll continue to do, we still believe that we will have -- we have strong brands sending and receiving connection will drive digital, as we do it in the retail money transfer. One thing I just want to make sure also is that our retail money transfers, our core business, is the core and we still believe that there is a huge opportunity to grow that. Otherwise, I wouldn't have this strong ambitions with the team to grow our retail network to 1 million locations.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And then, Glenn, on the marketing for 2012. We'll be right around the same levels we were in 2011, about 4% of the top line we'll spend on marketing.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then, second to last question. Just a little more granular color on expectations for C2C versus B2B, well, Business Solutions margins. I know one's going to be under pressure because of the amortization, but just the magnitudes of the trajectories. I mean, you're expecting 25 bps expansion in C2C or 50 bps?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. I'd say, if we look at the overall, company-wide, to give you a sense, Glenn, operating margins, company-wide, we expect them to be flat, if you will, to 26% in '12 and '11. The EBITDA margins, we do expect those to be at 29.6% in '11 versus 30% in 2012. Again, as we've looked at the C2C business, I continue to expect to have strong margins there. Clearly, in the C2B business, because we are through some investment cycle with Custom House integration there, the C2B margins I do expect to strengthen there. But we are going to invest $50 million to integrate Travelex Global Business Payments. And we think that's really important to help move that top line to the low double-digit revenue growth. We have a 2% share. We think we have an opportunity to have much greater than 2% share, so we'll invest behind that. But overall, we expect EBITDA margins to be slightly up next year and operating profit margin to be flattish with 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Ashwin from Citi. So I guess my question is, you run basically a portfolio of corridors. And when I look at the year-over-year comparison of what was not working last year versus what's sort of not working this year, can you provide where we stand? And Europe was weak both years, last year and this year, so where do we stand with Ivory Coast with the -- with countries in the Middle East? And then, is there a timeframe for Russia or China or Mexico to get better here into -- of your own actions?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So Ashwin basically, we have 16,000 corridors, right? So I mean, that detail our business, and it's hard to come up, but generally, I would say that I wouldn't see Europe as weak. Certain corridors in Europe, especially from southern Europe to certain corridors, that had some impact. That our business from Gulf is doing good. Its growth business is back again. I think specially to South Asia, and Philippines, Asia, parts of Asia is doing very well. Our U.S. outbound business is doing well. We did do -- saw some challenges, obviously, to Mexico, do -- as I mentioned before in the call, but I think that's going to. The Russia business is mainly driven to Central Asia business. And that has been impacted by strong pricing competitors, which we think that we can -- we have a plan to compete against it in the long term. But it will take some time. I would say, overall, from corridor point of view, I except Southern Europe, I would say that the business is holding pretty well and the Gulf is back.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. I guess, my next question then would be on growth then, looking at margins and the digital business as you grow that. What should we expect for the margin profile in that business? I mean, given the potential to eliminate the agent on one or both ends. Do you expect margins to be correspondingly higher?", "Hikmet Ersek", "First of all, I don't believe that eliminated agents, Ashwin, as you know, what I said before is that Michael is having 1 million agent locations and I get challenging questions about few years ago, \"Would you ever have 500,000 agent locations?\" And we are almost there now. First of all, I would say that you need the agent locations to connect the digital with the agent. Otherwise, this business has -- many people tried to build this business and the issue is that building the retail with the digital, and we have it. I would say that, on the send side, we do believe that that's a high-margin business and we're going to increase the margin, definitely, because we had agents on the send side and we do have operating model to drive this business. But we have to invest in the beginning and to grow -- to come to a revenue expansion and margin expansion business.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Real quick bookkeeping question. How much of the buyback is included in your guidance?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Ashwin, this is Scott. For a variety of reasons, I don't give you a specific number. But maybe let me give you some color of our thinking. And clearly, we want to be returning capital to our shareholders, both in a balanced way through dividends and buyback. In fact, we increased the dividend by 25% today. But what we're trying to do with buyback is get cash for our shareholders, but also balance it out with keeping a strong balance sheet, if you will. So as we think about 2012, you probably won't see buyback to the level we did in 2011 at the $800 million. But I'd probably have you think about the years of 2009, 2010, as we see things today, probably at that type of level as we move forward through 2012.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet, I wanted to get your thoughts on the new regulatory environment because of the CFPB, and if you think that'll have any impact on business conditions or your ability to grow market share.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, on the consumer protection side, I believe that, first of all, we are looking at it from the U.S. side very carefully on that, how the new regulations are. But our -- Kartik, our business, well, as you know, is quite simple and quite transparent. The sender, we call this fixed offset. The sender exactly knows what the receiver will get, what -- how much we're going to payout. That puts our business model in a very advantaged part that we are quite transparent. Saying that, though, if you look at that -- the new rules, we believe that we cannot adopt our business model also where it's needed to the requirements, and but we don't see a huge change in our business model. We believe that we are -- can apply the regulations very easy.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then, what are your expectations for the C2C market growing in 2012, considering some of these headwinds that are being posed by the economies of the world?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I would generally say that our C2C business is very well-positioned, right? If you exclude the electronic channels, the digital part, I think we are very well-positioned. The -- I'm still saying cautiously, as I mentioned before, on Europe. Parts of Europe, especially south parts of Europe. Today, I think Spain announced again the unemployment rate of about 22%. And Italy have some issues also. But Germany, U.K., France, our business is doing well. I think the employment rates are -- or they are stable. So it impacts all that. But Europe, I would like to stay on 2012 cautious on Europe. You want to add something on that?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "No, I think that, that frames it well, Hikmet.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then just one last question. The margin decline in Asia-Pacific, was that just pricing pressure or was that Western Union investing more money to grow market share or something else?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, it's still very strong at that 28%-type level. And it's really the latter as you described. We invested more in marketing. We had a little bit more in compliance, which I think is an investment in the brand, too, but really things to help drive the top line on a long-term basis. But overall, strong margins in APAC, it almost -- not quite 30%, but nearly 30%.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think, Kartik, I would like to be really invested on that stuff. I mean we have now in Asia-Pacific, including India, China, in APAC about 200,000 locations, Kartik. I mean, that's a huge coverage there. And I think there's still room to grow, though.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just quick question. Could you just provide some color on thoughts around the new restrictions we're seeing in Italy, maybe how impactful that is to you, and is that in your guidance assumptions? And then maybe on the other side of that, are there any macro assumptions built-in for potential pickup in housing starts? Maybe if you can give us a little more color on what you think might come out of any type of housing recovery and how impactful that could be to your fundamentals?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, jump in, Scott, I'll try to answer the first part and the second of the question. First part is on Italy. I think that has been some impact at some of the higher brands of the revenue on PPT, principal per transaction, has been impacted for putting some regulation from non-European Union Citizen showing ID. But I believe long term, look at Italy, we have the retails and we have the banks there, right? And bank customers don't -- who have the Know Your Customer registered already, don't have to go through the process, only the retail customers have to go through the process. So our portfolio is pretty well settled. And we -- it's not the first time we have it in some countries. In the beginning you'll see some changes on the process that impact on the transaction numbers. But long term, we always come back to customers and they said, well, then -- still use our service. On the housing then, I would say that it will help, right? Everything, building new houses, building in the construction, it helps. They are our first sign in the U.S. that employment rates are picking up. That will definitely help that our customers, many of our customers do work in the construction area, they do make money and send back to their loved ones. In Gulf states, you saw some investments, as you recall, in the last 3 quarters or some -- I talk about the investment in Saudi Arabia. And that started to payback and the customers are sending -- working there and sending back to the south Asian corridors.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, and Darrin, in regard to the outlook. In the fourth quarter, we did see some impact from the Italy regulations, so we've built that into our 2012 outlook. And likewise, for the U.S., we haven't built in an assumption that things are going to improve due to housing.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. That's great and helpful. And then one quick question on the margin again. I know there's been a couple of points discussing it, but correct me if I'm wrong, I was under the impression that depreciation and amortization, or incremental DNA from Travelex was around -- it was, I think, over $50 million in the year. That's somewhere around 90 basis points of pressure on a year-over-year basis. But your guidance on EBITDA margins is really only for mildly higher, right? About 30, 40 basis points. So is there maybe just some conservatism built into that, or is it just an approximation?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. We just called out the intangible amortization, which is going -- combined for business solution and Travelex going from about $20 million to $60 million, so there's a $40 million impact there, which is roughly 70 basis points or so. There is additional depreciation as well. There's additional, I think, about $50 million or so of depreciation coming from Travelex.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And then just last question on Mexico. Can you just give a little more color on what exactly you're doing there? I just, maybe, I think you mentioned before how you're expecting a little bit of slower trend, but maybe give us some -- a little more explanation, and then I'll just go back to the queue after that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Hey, Darrin, if you look at our Mexico business, it's really -- it's a little bit affected by ongoing compliance pressures which we are changing, especially from southwest border. As you recall, we had agreed on 2009 to work with an independent monitor on our compliance activities. And that we see that some of the activities has been impacted our business. And we're also looking at 2012, all our model of practices in Mexico. We are in process of reviewing some agent agreements and changing our operating model in Mexico. We're going to upgrade our compliance-related changes. We're going to be more -- we really want to be the industry standard and the highest standard of industry. I think we want to really be the highest there. So I believe that we have the right approach there. And just to put the things in perspective, as you know, none of our business -- Mexico is not larger than 6% in 2011 of our business, right? So ...", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just had another question on the margin. Just trying to conceptualize longer-term. I know you guys have always talked to the management team as being committed to long-term margin expansion of the business. And obviously in '12, you've got kind of this one-off situation with the intangibles due to the Travelex deal but at the same time, you're telling us that you don't see any other large acquisitions on your near-term horizon. So if you kind of take that factor out longer-term, can you just talk us through where you guys stand from a strategic perspective in terms of the priority of margin to expand longer-term, both on an EBIT and on EBITDA basis?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think -- first of all, management is committed for the margin expansion. To do that, we need to grow. And I think we are investing in the right way to do -- to get the growth, right? We have been -- as you saw in 2012, a little bit impacted -- we believe we're going to be impacted from the economic slowdown, especially in Europe. And that will impact our growth rates, which were being similar to 2011 Q4. That's the projection we have it from 2012. So on the growth rate, I have to say that besides the card business will grow on the C2C, but we believe also the B2B growing low double-digit and also electronic channels growing on the 40% approximately. I think we are really set for the growth. And with that investment, they will be definitely a help on the margin expansion. So my team and I am very committed for the margin expansion, but for that, we need definitely growth. You want to jump on that?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. The only thing I would add, Jason, is that these business models are set up to drive margin expansion with roughly 65% of our cost variable, 35% of our costs are fixed. As a management team, on a long-term basis, we're committed to drive margin expansion, whether that's operating margin or EBITDA margin. And just review the 2 things that are impacting the operating margins in '12, the additional amortization, and then, if you will, the investments we're making in the business, the $35 million for digital, we believe that will be a $0.5 billion business in 2015. So we think it's very much well worth the investment today for the future.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That all makes sense. Just to shift gears for a second over to Travelex because I think the execution that, that part, that people are really focused on. And if I recall, when you guys announced the acquisition, you suggest that it would be accretive to cash EPS in 2012. So I wanted to confirm, is that still the case? And any sense you can give us on order of magnitude there?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. It is, for sure, still cash accretive to EPS in 2012. Looking forward to 2013, we expect it to be both GAAP accretive and cash accretive in 2013. As far as magnitude, I'd probably have you think about roughly the intangibles going from $20 million to $60 million as a noncash charge, if you will, Jason. And then, we do have $50 million of integration charges, although those are cash, we expect those to go away in the future, as we get it integrated.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one follow-up on Travelex, and I guess more broadly on Business Solutions. Can you give us an update on the size of the sales force there and growth plans for the sales force in 2012, as you continue to pursue the double-digit top line growth opportunities on that side of the business?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I mean, if you think about our business, we are very active on the set, now we are in 23 countries. We have about 500 people selling our products there, getting to SMEs. We have about 100,000 SME customers in our portfolio. Our approach is really using our existing agent network, which do consumer-to-consumer money transfer, also selling B2B. And it works already, we have about 16 agents signed on that, 6 of them are already active selling this, our business. So we are very much active on selling that, and our sales force is about 500 people selling our products there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Just to back up real quickly and to make sure I have the growth rates for 2012 correct. Can you just give us that target growth rates for C2C? And then maybe if you can decouple electronic channels in '12? And then lastly, the Business Solutions piece, please?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, well, I'll work backwards with Business Solutions. What we expect there is low double-digit constant currency revenue growth, not only for 2012, but really over the next several years. For electronics, we expect double-digit, strong double-digit revenue growth in the electronic business. And then, Julio, the color on the C2C business is that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter, those type of growth rates, we're cautious about Europe, but we expect C2C to see those type of growth rates throughout 2012.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And maybe, Hikmet, this one more directly for you. If we go back and compare the strategy that you laid out back in 2010 at the end of the year. You had identified a lot of the -- quite frankly, a lot of the same things that you're talking about today in terms of areas of investments. And yet, as we go into 2012, it feels like you have to do more in the way of incremental investments to sort of to keep pace. Is it the economy that's driving some of the requirements for incremental investments? Is there more competition? So if you could just kind of help us bridge the gap between what you guys sort of laid out as your investment strategy in 2010 versus where you are now to 2012. Where is the change on the margin in the sense that you guys actually have to go out and invest more to stay more competitive?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I mean, if we -- as we talked in 2010, and as you recall, our investors meeting there, we outlined our strategy. I think we are really executing against our strategy now. What we did is also -- we won't forget that we expect the margin in 2011, and think we are doing the right thing. We grow the revenue since 2008. The highest growth was in 2011, the best year on the top line. So I think we have the right strategy. Plus last year, we built a second leg on the B2B. We have, on customers and Travelex put together to rescue Business Solutions, and we want to grow that by double-digit, low double-digit growth. So on the electronic channels, Julio, really, we are -- one, that was growing 35% to 40% already with limited capabilities. So what we are doing here is that taking this business channel, a new region called, or whatever it is they call it, the new channels to $500 million, $0.5 billion business. And that needs some capability investments. That needs some investments to around the consumers and that's what we are really doing on that part. I wouldn't say that big pricing -- big pricing challenge globally. As you recall, our pricing investment was around 1% 2011, and we assume that it will be 1% to 2% in 2012.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just lastly on the competitive front, with all of the different P2P options that have popped up over the last couple of months now with, obviously, PayPal and Fiserv, and in MCR, yesterday, all kind of jump in to B2B. How do you think about that from a competitive dynamic going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, from the competition side, I think we are very well-positioned. What differentiates us from the competition, as I said, is our global brand, our regulator relationship present in 200 countries, and our connecting the electronic with the retail. Plus, I just wanted to say also, on the prepaid side and also on the top up side, we have a partnership with MasterCard. And I'm very excited, actually, with our partnership with Ajay Banga and I sit together, we talked about how that could be. These 2 companies, Western Union serving the underserved customers having the brand awareness in emerging markets combining with MasterCard's capability with electronic capability makes big sense to take that, our stored value, to the next stage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Kissane with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just following up on Darrin's question. The compliance issues in Mexico, are those industry-wide or company-specific? And maybe, if you can be a little more specific in terms of how you're going to change the model and maybe some of the agent, how you deal with the agents, and will there be any impact on pricing in Mexico?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thanks, Jim. On Mexico, I would say that it's more company-specific because we came on the 2009 in an agreement, as you recall, and we are implementing really with the independent monitor, the agreement requirements. And it does impact our business. I would say that also it sets industry standard, at which we are very proud. I think we are building on that, but it does impact our business, especially in some southwest border. I think that's where we are really focused on that. And that's really -- it's a high priority within the company, and we believe that long-term, we're in a very well-positioned environment with that.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And Jim, on the agent model, we're currently in negotiations for agent renewals in Mexico. So it's premature for us to talk about what's going to happen there. But once things are finalized, we'll be able on the discuss that.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. But that's on the receive side, not so much on the send side?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, you're right.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. On the southwest border is on the send side, the compliance issues, Jim.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then in Russia, you talked about the retail competition being more intense. Looking out, how are you -- plan on countering the retail competition in Russia?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, we're going to do that same things which we do with the European Union with the PSD. I think we will have the right sales force there also. The big thing is also it's a pricing issue there. I think we have to balance between pricing and gaining market share and gaining transactions. I think that that's all in our business plan, and we have the right plan to expand that.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just last question on China. Can you give us an outlook on the revenue growth there, and did the time or the new year have any impact on the fourth quarter growth?", "Hikmet Ersek", "As you know, we don't give -- we didn't -- we never give specific numbers on China. But generally, I think we are very well-positioned in China. It had some currency impact, Scott, believe me, right? That's currency. It had impact, some on the higher RPG. Also, some corridors had some regulations from Africa to China and to South America...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "To South America.", "Hikmet Ersek", "To South America, was not China. But China have some impact on our business on the regulation side. But generally, I would say that with our locations there, we had top banks, now we have also the regional banks there, I would say that we've -- good position. And don't forget, China is currently an inbound country only.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Follow-up on the Travelex or the B2B business. I think when you bought Travelex, you were looking for about $400 million in revenue in 2012, and I know currencies moved, then the dollar strengthened a little bit since then. But what is your outlook for revenue for that B2B piece in 2012?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, it's very similar to use a round number as we combine Travelex-Western Union Business Solutions, we expect it's about that $400 million number.", "Robert P. Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on your digital business. $100 million to $500 million. I mean, that's a 50% annualized growth rate. Are you on track for that in 2012, that kind of growth organically? And this is all without acquisitions?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, yes, that's without acquisitions. And I believe that we are on track on to reach our $500 million business. We are very confident about that.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And Bob, you can imagine, we're investing in a lot of these things that's going to help the business. So until the investments are in place, the growth will come a little bit later. But we have strong growth last year in the existing business, we expect strong growth, but the growth will probably ramp up as we go out towards 2015.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just on your growth rate, I mean, do you think you're losing some market share now? I mean, the World Bank is looking for, I think, upper mid-single digit transaction growth. I mean, you saw MoneyGram report mid-double digit near, I think, 13% transaction growth. I mean are some of these issues in Mexico, in Italy, in Russia, are you currently losing market share, do you think?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We believe in the cross-border money transfer, we gain market share. We compare, as you know, Rob, usually with Aite, our numbers. We believe we gain share. We do have, as I mentioned before, seen some countries like Russia or Southern Europe, some challenges. But I would say that our belief is gaining market share, and we believe we've gained market share in 2011.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And if you look -- yes, last question. Your Bill Pay business. If you go back several years, I mean, that Bill Pay business, the U.S. piece, I think, was -- a lot of that was rapid pay. Your margins, you were generating operating margins in the 30% range. And granted the mortgage piece isn't coming back to rapid pay, but the auto finance is screaming back in the U.S. as far as the growth and -- or I mean, is that business changed such that you don't have the operating leverage, you're not going to get -- I mean, I would have expected to see a little bit more acceleration in growth in the U.S. business, given the growth of -- I think, auto was -- is a big piece of that business. You've added a lot of billers. But what is going on with that business? Can -- I mean, are the margins that we saw in the past just not achievable in the future? Is there more competition?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. Definitely, that business has evolved over time, especially as we move through the financial crisis of 2009 and 2010 with subprime and so forth. We do now have 10,000 billers, so we're further diversifying our biller base. The one thing I'd probably point out, Bob, that might be helpful in the fourth quarter, out of the Global Business Payments segment, if you take out Travelex now in that -- if you take Travelex out of that, that segment would have had margins over 20%. So the margins are getting better there. When you kind of look more on of an apples-to-apples basis. And we do believe that business, in 2012, the C2B business would be steady. Although the revenue could be somewhat impacted by some of the Durbin pass-through, but we do see a steady C -- C2B business in 2012. In the last 3 quarters, we have grown that business 2%, where it was declining before that. So we feel like we are on the right path to improving that business.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Didn't Travelex have margins in the 30% range, excluding amortization expense?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. Travelex had EBITDA margins right about 30% range. Travelex Global Business Payments. But you have to remember, in the fourth quarter, we had $5 million of integration expense, we had depreciation and amortization, so all those things impacted that segment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just a few very quick questions. First, Hikmet, at the time of the September 2010 Analyst Day, you highlighted agent commission as a significant source of possible cost savings as you go through the 5-year contract renewal cycle. Where do you stand with respect to that renewal cycle? And do you still believe that you could bring commission rates down over time?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I think, yes. The answer is yes. We are bringing down and it's -- especially the agent contract renegotiation, there's always the seasonality. In some years, it's higher because of the agent contracts are coming to renewals with CapEx investments, everything, the effective rates impacts there. But generally, our current cost of services going south, which is going down, which is great, and helps us. And it's also win-win situation, long-term agreements, I think we have the right formula here, bringing the agent commissions long-term down, and keeping the agents for a longer time with -- in our network.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And second, Scott, do you still expect to have ballpark $70 million of restructuring cost savings in 2012?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "We do. It was $55 million in '11. We think there'll be an incremental $15 million. So $70 million in 2012.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just a quick final question, nice to see the 25% dividend increase. Can you be a little more granular on your acquisition appetite? Are you done with the big deals for now and it's, basically, all share repurchase and dividends? Or are you still on a lookout for large transactions?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Oh, I think obviously, constant -- as a business leader, you are constantly look on acquisition opportunities, right? That's my -- is that an opportunity, we have a healthy capital structure, so we do look at it. But I think our focus for 2012 is mainly on the integration of Travelex. We did a big move in 2011. We built a second leg of business and we are focused on our -- now I don't see from today's point of view, on a bigger acquisition like the Travelex one, but we do see opportunities on the smaller one, which will expand our capabilities in electronic channels or in other parts of the business. So I will say that we are constantly looking for an acquisition but not on a larger scale. Current, I don't see another opportunity.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Quick final question. Where are the TGBP integration costs located in the P&L? Are they cost of services or SG&A?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "The $5 billion, it's split, a little bit in cost of services and SG&A. And what we may do, David, on a go-forward basis in 2012, is give you color on how those break between the 2 lines.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I had 2 questions. First one, just going back to the capital a bit. Can you at all talk about ultimately what you think the capital returns, sort of what the profile might look like between buyback and dividend? You currently sit, I guess, roughly around a 20%, 25% payout ratio, which is obviously much better than it was, and you've done a good job there. Do you see that as a ratio, as we look out 3, 4, 5 years, that it could be notably higher than the current payout ratio, with more emphasis on the dividend versus the buyback?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Tim, it's Scott. As we think about our business, we clearly want to invest in our business, but also get cash back to our shareholders, and we want to do that in a balanced way. Probably, one way to look at that historically is the last 4 years, we've raised the dividend, at least once per year, if you will, from that standpoint. So we'll continue to work closely with our board and our management team to have dialogue around that. But as the business performs, as things work, we would like to do things to move the dividend up. But also be balanced with the stock buyback. The good news with our business, we generate so much cash flow, it allows us to do a number of things, whether it's investing in the business, moving the dividend up like we did today, about 25%, and returning cash to our shareholders through stock buyback.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Also, keeping the -- in the right balance cash availability, because it's important also for us in parts of the world to have the ratings in place. And if you go to the several parts of the world, you want to keep a good rating company, which other big companies want to work with you. That's the financial strength is also important to keep the business and have a good relationship with many partners.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up I have was just going back to the electronic channels. I apologize if you hit on this in prior answers in your comments. But do you at all have any kind of feel for, if there's any, even if it's minor, cannibalization of sort of the legacy customer base or legacy transaction that is occurring with your growth of account-to-cash or through mobile? And then as you think about this $500 million target, do you all expect people that are typically going in and sending money as an agent are going to be part of that equation, and now they're going to do it from their mobile phone or off the computer instead going to an agent and sending money to a relative or somebody overseas?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, well, most of the customers are new customers, we are getting to New Customer segment. There may be some of the cannibalization. But depending also on the geography where you are. In some countries, it's really new. In some countries, the existing ones are using. That I would say that generally, I would say, it's the new customers. We believe we are really coming to a New Customer segment. And on the receive side, we are being -- I mean, I give also me as an example, right? I used to go to a location, Safeway location, since we have westernunion.com in the U.S. and me, I'm a new migrant, I send money to my father in Istanbul with electronic because I don't have time to go through that. But I still on Saturdays and Sundays, I go to Safeway and still use it. So it's a balance between that, absolutely.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.", "Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to go back to segments and these investments for the year. You called out the $35 million incremental for the digital channel. But could you either put a round number around the consolidated investment that you're looking at this year, or at least can you help us with your costs to the build out the sales force? And then these other incremental expenses as it relates to Mexico, Italy and Russia?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, to kind of give you a sense, and you hit on the $35 million to the digital investment, and I would say that's, of all the investments, that's the larger piece of it for sure. We are investing in the sales force. We think, we believe, we have opportunities to increase even more market shares and march towards that 1 million locations down the road, if you will. Also to make some investments behind the technology and customer acquisitions. But I don't want to parse it too fine, Dan. But think about digital, $35 million is the bigger -- biggest part of that investment.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, as you think of -- yes, so when you think about these investments in WU-dot-com, and sales force, I  mean, these are infrastructure investments, so we're hiring people and creating technology that will be there as ongoing as well.", "Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And as you think about doubling your agent network from here, how do we think about the incremental margins associated with those? I suspect they're smaller in size, will there be any super agents that you have to rely on? Is there a new infrastructure that you think you have to have in order to get you to doubling of that size? It's a pretty significant call-out for you guys.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, it is significant expansion of our retail thing. Don't forget that we really started to get -- first of all, we do have direct agent relationship. I think the super agent model, what we had in the past, opening account to be done, entrepreneur, and expanding, it's all where you are really having the direct agent model, which is also more cost efficient with us. So we believe that certain geography, certain class of trade is still untapped. Certain banks in U.S. are still untapped, and some retailers in Europe. But most importantly, emerging markets, there are still a huge numbers, as we -- nobody -- as I was over the seas, a few years ago, we wouldn't come up, coming up with 200,000 locations in Asia-Pacific. I think we significantly changed the environment. And knowing the market a little bit, there are still opportunities to grow that, and I believe we can do that.", "Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And on the types of the transactions that you would expect from this kind of the next bucket of agents. are you expecting as much cross-border transaction or more kind of intra-country transactions, where you might not get the spread?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Several financial services, which I outlined from my strategy could be cross-border, intra-transactions also, but cross-border also. And some of the countries which are inbound-only will be turned to outbound also, because the migration patterns are changing. And in the rural areas, still, we have a need to expand that. Also, could be with our MasterCard agreement, some of them using as a top up location as we expand the -- our prepaid and stored value activities, globally, with partners. That will be also part of it.", "Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, can you just from the appetite that the super agents are having to sell this business-to-business or Business Solutions -- I know you said there are 16 that signed up, 6 are active. Are you expecting that to be at all significant as you look at maybe just Business Solutions as a standalone segment in 2012 and '13? Or is that in the still kind of early days as a cross-selling opportunity?", "Hikmet Ersek", "First, we just started with that, right? So I think it's the early days to tell how that will be. But I believe really on that model, the reason for that, it reminds me how we expanded our consumer-to-consumer money transfer business. It's a similar part. And the more and more request is coming actually from the agents saying that, \"Yes, eventually, you have a new business segment, we can also send this -- sell before -- besides the C2C also B2B with our existing.\" Is it in Latin America or is it in Philippines? They say that, \"Hey, you have already existing Western Union brand there. We have the regulatory environment there, why shouldn't we sell also to money transfer part also to the small business entities?\"", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'll be quick, just 2 questions. I guess it sounds like compliance and regulatory challenges are hampering the growth rate in several countries, Italy, Mexico, China. I guess, Hikmet, do you worry that, that could spread to other nations and just becomes a global phenomenon?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think, first of all, with our compliance one, we are really on it. I think Western Union is, I believe, has the focus, and it's a higher priority in our environment. I think they're really setting the industry standard. And my aim is, with our general counsel and with around the money laundering activities, to set up in our very high priority. That's the thing. I would say that regulatory environment and this business has been always challenging in 200 countries. I wouldn't say that as a spread out because we have the right environment, in many countries, don't forget that we have already 0 thresholds, which we did implemented. We work very closely to regulators. And some of the competitive that has been always a challenge to enter some markets because of the regulatory environment. I feel quite confident that we have the right structure to meet the regulatory environment needs.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one for Scott. I think operating margins ended up at 26.1% for the year. And that's excluding restructuring. I think the guidance was 26% to 26.5%. So that was a little bit on the low end. Just was wondering, Scott, if there were any takes that put us there on that side of the fence towards the low end?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Not particularly. We had a wide range -- or I shouldn't say a wide range, but 26% to 26.5%. FX did have some impact on that. And then we did pick up $9 million of deal cost in the fourth quarter. So there's a variety of things, but they came in, basically, exactly where we expected. And then, 2012, we are expecting to improve the EBITDA margins. So we're on path to do that.", "Michael A. Salop", "For the full year, we had $20 million of deal cost related to the Travelex acquisitions which at the -- I mean, FX was a big impact on margin last year as well.", "Well, thanks, everyone, for the call. We hope you have a good evening, and we'll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you. And good morning, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Global Operations, will discuss 2012 first quarter results. Following the remarks, we will open the call for questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "As we noted in our February earnings call, beginning with this quarter, Western Union has implemented a new segment structure to reflect the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments, management changes and strategic initiatives. We now classify segments as Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business, Business Solutions and other. The Consumer-to-Consumer segment has not changed from our previous reporting. Other primarily includes retail money order, prepaid and Mobile Money Transfer. Within Consumer-to-Consumer, we now provide metrics on 6 regions. These include Europe and the CIS, North America, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean and westernunion.com online money transfer. Our India and South Asia business is now included in the Asia Pacific region. As a result of reporting these additional regions, we will no longer be providing individual country metrics in our supplemental tables. However, we will give you color on country performance and will continue to provide domestic money transfer and Mexico results throughout 2012. We issued an 8-K last week, which describes the new segments and regions as well as provides historical reclassifications.", "As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2011 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone.", "Overall, our performance in the quarter was generally in line with our expectations, and we made some good progress in our 3 strategic growth areas of Global Consumer Financial Services, Business Solutions and Ventures.", "In consumer-to-consumer money transfer, our revenue growth accelerated compared to the fourth quarter as constant currency revenue growth increased to 5%. Our North American business was generally strong, and we also saw improved revenue trends in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions. U.S. domestic money transfer continued to deliver good growth, and Mexico revenue increased in the quarter. The expected softness in Europe and Russia is here and we did see flat results for the region compared to a year ago, but revenue trends were slightly improved relative to the fourth quarter.", "We made more progress in advancing our class-of-trade strategies in money transfer. We recently signed SunTrust Bank as an agent in the U.S., adding to a list that includes U.S. Bank, KeyBank, Regions, Fifth Third and others. Globally, almost 60% of our Western Union agent locations are banks and post offices, but we are also widely present in retail, supermarkets, travel agents, other financial services and many more classes of trade.", "I'm also very pleased to announce that in April we reached 500,000 agent locations around the world. This is a huge milestone in Western Union's 160 years of history. We believe the expansion of our presence in 200 countries and territories will continue and it will remain a competitive advantage to grow our core money transfer and other products.", "Beyond our core Global Consumer Financial Services, we are also making progress evolving our new businesses. Although our Business Solutions pro forma revenue growth of 5% was below our target due to some softness in North America and the U.K., our new customer acquisitions remained strong and our geographic expansion is progressing. Business Solutions is now able to offer services directly or through partners in 25 countries. Our integration efforts with Travelex are on track. Our growth strategies are being implemented, and we remain committed to low double-digit constant currency revenue growth for this business over the next several years.", "In Ventures, we continue to make excellent progress with digital money transfer as westernunion.com revenues increased almost 40% in the quarter and shortly will again deliver double-digit revenue growth. We have begun our additional investment in digital. Our San Francisco office is up and running and we remain very excited about the opportunity and results we are seeing with this business. The innovation regarding additional channels and products at Western Union is happening.", "I'm also pleased to announce the appointment of David Thompson as Western Union's new Chief Information Officer. David will serve as the company's Head Technology Officer responsible for building and supporting the next-generation payments, products and services. He was most recently Global CIO of Symantec and was previously at Oracle and PeopleSoft.", "Turning to our results for the quarter. Our operating margins was below last year's level. It was primarily the result of the impact of Business Solutions and the Travelex acquisition, investment and some expense timing. However, we believe we will see the margin improve from the first quarter as we move through the year and are forecasting the full year margin to be similar to last year.", "We resumed our share repurchase program in the quarter, buying back almost $150 million of stock and increased our dividend by 25% to $0.10 per share. In total, we returned over $200 million to shareholders in the quarter through buybacks and dividends.", "I also want to mention a few events in the quarter that do not show up in the financial results but are examples of the many ways we are evolving our business for the future as we continue to add new services and customers. We recently introduced WU Pay, a new and innovative electronic payments platform that allows online shoppers in the U.S. to pay for purchases from their bank accounts or in cash at Western Union agent locations. This provides ease for consumers, many of them who are not comfortable providing credit card numbers or other personal payment information online. WU Pay is also being added as a payment option for consumers to fund money transfer on westernunion.com.", "In Mobile Money Transfer, we signed a strategic agreement with Ericsson to integrate Western Union's Mobile Money Transfer services with Ericsson's platform. This will enable mobile networks operators who use Ericsson solution to easily add Western Union Money Transfer to their suite of offerings. And Ericsson has a relationship globally with over 450 mobile network operators.", "In Canada, we are teaming with Acxsys, a leader in debit payment services. This agreement will allow customers of the bank that connect to Canada's Interac funds transfer system to access Western Union money transfer services. Previously, these customers had a domestic account-to-account money transfer system, but now they will also be able to send and receive international money transfer through their online and mobile bank accounts with funds for payout at Western Union locations around the world.", "And in Business Solutions, we launched an exclusive agreement with Mercer Outsourcing in the U.K., the largest pension administrator, to handle payment to retirees living in 80 countries.", "These are just a few examples of actions we have taken to evolve Western Union. We believe strongly in our core, but we also know we are -- have a great opportunity to leverage our assets and extend more services to more customers as we execute our vision to be the premier financial service provider to the underserved.", "We hope you will be able to join us for our Investor Day on May 9 in New York City where you will hear much more about our strategies and plans to grow all of our businesses. However, right now, I would like to turn the call over to Scott to give you a more detailed review of the quarter. Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet.", "Overall for the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 9% on a reported and constant currency basis. Consolidated pro forma revenue increased 4%, or 5% constant currency, including Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior-year period. Consolidated pro forma revenue growth was driven by improved trends in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment.", "The Consumer-to-Business segment again delivered a slight revenue increase in the quarter. And Business Solutions revenue grew 5% on a pro forma basis, adjusting to include Travelex in the prior-year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenue growth accelerated to 5%, up from 3% in the fourth quarter. Transaction growth also improved to 7%, up from 5% last quarter. C2C cross-border principal increased 2%, or 3% on a constant currency basis, which was steady with last quarter. C2C principal per transaction declined 4% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis.", "Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of consolidated revenues, was flat year-over-year due to the expected softness in Southern Europe and Russia. This was a slight improvement from the 1% decline last quarter as the rate of decline in Russia moderated. Our turnaround strategies in Russia are being phased in, including adding a retail network, further developing our existing bank network with new locations, planning ATM kiosk providers, adjusting prices for various corridors and renewed marketing for the brand.", "Turning to North America. The region's revenues increased 5% compared to 2% last quarter. U.S. outbound and Canada strengthened while domestic money transfer continues to have solid momentum with revenue growth of 9% on transaction growth of 12% in the quarter. Mexico improved from last quarter with both revenue and transactions increasing 3% in the quarter. As we mentioned in February, we are still determining and implementing changes to our compliance-related practices in Mexico. Although we still expect to see some negative impact on the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands as we evolve our business model and compliance-related practices throughout the year, our Western Union brand is performing well.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue increased 6% in the quarter, an improvement from 2% last quarter, with good growth from both the Gulf states and Africa.", "The Asia Pacific region grew revenues 7%, which is up slightly from last quarter's growth. This quarter's results were driven by growth across the region, including India and the Philippines. China revenue declined, although this was primarily due to our decision to restrict transfer from Argentina to avoid currency risk on our cash balances in that country.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue grew 2%, which was down slightly from last quarter. Lack of revenue growth is being negatively impacted by currency translations compared to the prior-year period.", "Westernunion.com, which we now report as our sixth region, again delivered strong results as revenue increased 39% in the quarter. Westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates for the other 5 regions.", "Total electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com as well as account-based money transfer and mobile, increased 38% in the quarter and represented 3% of total company revenue. In addition to westernunion.com, we also continue to make strong progress with adding our services to online banking platforms.", "Revenue from account-based money transfer transactions increased 43% in the quarter. We now have nearly 90 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with 44 active, including U.S. Bank and Regions Bank in the U.S.", "Prepaid revenue increased 17% in the quarter. In total, prepaid, including third-party top-up, represented just under 1% of company revenue for the quarter. Our prepaid cards are now available at more than 20,000 retail locations globally, including over 19,000 locations in the U.S. We're now in 7-Eleven stores in the U.S. and have launched cards in the U.K., Germany and Austria. In the quarter, we had over $260 million loaded onto our cards through over 600,000 loads.", "Turning back to the total C2C business. The spread between transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points, excluding the impact of currency which negatively impacted the spread by approximately 1 point. The impact of net price decreases was less than 1% in the first quarter, and mix was about 1%. For the full year, we continue to expect C2C price decreases to be in the range of 1% to 2%.", "Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. This business continued to have steady results, with the revenue increasing 1%, or 3% on a constant currency basis, led by international growth in South America.", "Business Solutions reported revenue of $87 million in the quarter, which compared to $28 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis adding last year's Travelex results back to the 2011 first quarter, Business Solutions revenue increased 5%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. Australia performed well where we saw some slower-than-expected revenue growth in our North America and U.K. businesses in the quarter. This was primarily driven by slower global trade growth and lower currency volatility in some markets. Currency volatility benefited Business Solutions in the second half of last year.", "Despite the slower growth in the quarter, our customer acquisition remained strong and we're continuing to expand to new markets. And the integration of Travelex Global Business Payments is progressing well. And we remain committed to delivering constant currency revenue growth in low double digits this year.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The first quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 23.9%, which compares to 24.4% in the prior year. Excluding $6 million of Travelex integration expenses, our consolidated margin was 24.3% compared to 26.3%, excluding $24 million of restructuring expenses in the prior-year period.", "EBITDA margin, excluding integration expenses, was 28.9% compared to 29.7%, excluding restructuring expenses, in the first quarter of last year. The primary driver of the reduction in operating margin was Business Solutions and the impact of Travelex Global Business Payments acquisition, including an incremental $10 million of intangibles amortization.", "The first quarter consolidated margin was also negatively impacted by higher marketing expenses, additional costs related to investments into new ventures and southwest border compliance, acquisition-related expenses for Costa and Finint and the timing of certain expenses. In addition, marketing expenses were 3.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to 3.4% in the prior year. For the full year, we expect marketing expenses as a percent of revenue to be similar to last year at around 4%. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from revenue leverage, currency, restructuring savings and reduced bank fees related to Durbin.", "We believe our consolidated margins will improve as we move through the year, and we are still targeting GAAP margins of around 25% or margins, excluding Travelex integration expenses, of around 26% for the full year. Business Solutions margin should improve throughout the year as we benefit from revenue leverage and the beginning of some operating synergies in the second half. Consumer money transfer margins should also improve due to revenue leverage and timing of expenses.", "There were no restructuring expenses in the first quarter of 2012 as we completed all of our activities in the third quarter of last year. We realized approximately $18 million in restructuring savings in this year's first quarter. We continue to expect approximately $70 million of savings in 2012, or an incremental $15 million, compared to 2011.", "The tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, which compares to 23.5% in the first quarter of last year. The decrease in our tax rate is primarily due to the resolution of the treatment of our international operations, as we noted in the announcement of our agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on December 15, 2011, and the benefit of some small non-recurring adjustments in the quarter. For the full year, we still expect a tax rate of between 16% and 17%.", "Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.40, which compared to $0.32 in the prior year, or $0.35, excluding restructuring charges. Excluding last year's restructuring expenses, EPS increased 14%. First quarter 2012 EPS also rounded to $0.40, excluding the $6 million of pretax Travelex integration expenses.", "The C2C operating segment margin was 27.7% compared to 28.6% in the same period last year. The margin benefited from revenue leverage, currency and restructuring savings and was offset by increased marketing, Costa and Finint acquisition-related expenses, investments in westernunion.com, compliance costs and timing of some expenses.", "Within C2C, marketing as a percentage of revenue increased 60 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Costa and Finint are currently negatively impacting margins, but once we complete the integration and begin to realize cost savings, we should see positive contributions to margins later in the year.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin increased to 26.5% compared to 22.6% in the prior-year period. The margin increased primarily due to the impact of lower debit processing expenses related to Durbin. As a reminder, the reduction of debit fees due to Durbin is having a positive impact on our C2B margins, although it will negatively impact revenue in some cases as we pass through the savings.", "Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $15 million for the quarter compared to an operating loss of $4 million in the prior-year period. Last year's loss does not include Travelex Global Business Payments. This quarter's $15 million loss included $14 million of intangibles amortization and $6 million of Travelex integration expense. Intangibles amortizations in last year's first quarter was $4 million. As mentioned, the Business Solutions profitability should improve throughout the year as we benefit from revenue leverage and cost savings.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We remain in a strong position. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $215 million, which includes the impact of approximately $65 million of tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $76 million or 5% of revenue. As we noted in February, capital expenditures as a percent of revenue will be higher this year due to increased signing bonuses on agent contracts for several major renewals, and we are aggressively pursuing new agent signings. We are also adding to investments in westernunion.com and other new technology. We expect capital expenditures to get back to 3% of revenue on average after 2012, although any given year could be impacted by additional new agent signings or other initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $64 million in the quarter.", "At quarter end, the company had debt of $3.6 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 1/2 of the cash was in the United States.", "We continue our strong capital deployment policies. We resumed our share repurchase activities in the quarter, repurchasing 8 million shares totaling $147 million at an average price of $17.69. This represents 1% of the total shares outstanding. As of March 31, our shares outstanding were 614 million shares. We have approximately $470 million remaining under our existing authorization, which expires at the end of 2012.", "We also increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.10 per share and paid out $62 million in dividends. We remain committed to continuing with strong return of funds to shareholders throughout the year.", "Finally, we are affirming our full year 2012 financial outlook, including all the metrics provided in our February earnings release.", "In summary, our Consumer-to-Consumer business has started the year well, and we believe we will see better results from Business Solutions and stronger margins as we advance through the year. We are making good progress with the Travelex integration and in establishing other new growth areas in Ventures. We will continue to deploy our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business and return funds to shareholders.", "Operator, we're now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It looks like the trends on the transactions were a little bit stronger than, at least, we expected, and I'm curious. I mean, a lot of the corridors that you had some questions about last quarter, including Russia and Mexico, seem like they've hung in there, especially Mexico. Your revenue is also a little bit better than your guidance range, your constant currency revenue at least at about 5%. So what's inhibiting you from bringing the guidance up? Or are we just too early at the point right now, given, I guess, last quarter was around 3%?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Darren, this is Hikmet. Yes, I think, generally, I would say that we have stayed too cautious because given the uncertainty in Europe. We do have some improvements in North America and in Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific regions, but I would say that I would -- it's too early to give a different guidance than it is. We are affirming our guidance. We are very pleased with the quarter with our -- especially in the C2C revenue. I think the transactions are coming. There are some positive improvements here. But given also with what yesterday announcement already, what happened to the stock market, right, on the -- about the U.S., about the European news, I would say that I'm staying still cautious here for generally, and we -- but I'm affirming the revenue guidance.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Hikmet, just to clarify: I mean, we're now at, again, a little bit of a higher growth rate. Can you just give us a little more color, specific color, on what actually might have surprised you this quarter versus what you had expected when you gave that guidance? Because it looks like some of the corridors certainly were a little better.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think I didn't -- nothing specific surprising. I would say that the people are on the field and they are really giving us good indications about that. I think we have the same challenges, like in Russia, like in Mexico corridor. Their continuance to softness in some parts of Europe is here. But also, that gives us how good our business, how good is that, to be in 200 countries. The portfolio, managing the portfolio being in 200 countries has up and downs. But also the -- within the Europe even, like countries like Germany are growing good and gives us a comfort zone to affirming our guidance.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Just last question for me, and then I'll turn back to the queue. But on the margin side, you said -- I think, Scott, you said earlier the margin should show improvement through the year. Is it just growth on the top line and scale? Is it the timing of costs and marketing? Can you give us a little more color on specifically why through the year we'd expect it to ramp up?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure, Darrin. If you will, on a full year basis, we're still targeting operating margins of 26%, excluding the integration costs and EBITDA margins of 30%, excluding the integration costs, if you will. So we see a path there. A couple things that will be helpful as we move forward the next 2 to 3 quarters: First, it's the fixed cost leverage from higher absolute revenue as we move through the quarters; and then also improvement in Business Solutions. We currently have some heavy upfront spending there. We'll see some cost savings as we combine Travelex and Western Union Business Solutions later on in the year and then just better revenue growth from Business Solutions as we move through the year. Also, there's other things, Darrin, to a lesser extent, but Costa and Finint will have a lower integration spending and begin to see some of the synergy savings in the latter half of the year. And then we just did have timing of operating expenses, some with IT and operations. So some of the timing was heavier in the first quarter compared to other quarters. And the other thing I would add is as we run the business, you'll see some variation in margins from quarter-to-quarter but really making the right investment decisions, the right business decisions to drive growth and market share.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Just on -- add on that, Scott, Darrin. Incremental investment in -- like in westernunion.com, right? I mean, it pays back. You could see there\u2019s almost 40% growth. And people. We opened our office in San Francisco. We are hiring people. I think they are growing, and we want to grow that business faster. We have a target about, in 2015, $500 million. And I'll give you -- going to give you more color on that at our May Investors Day, 9 -- May 9 Investors Day in New York. But I'm very pleased with the investments. And they are long-term investments and they are going to pay back.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just want to ask about any correlation to the improvement in the C2C transactions. But the margins were a little bit lower than we expected. Is that due to -- I mean, any of that pick up in transaction growth due to the marketing or anything we can point to exactly that actually hurt the margins but helped transactions?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Bryan, not specifically, if you will. If you look at each of the regions, 4 of the 5 regions did see improved revenue growth Q1 over Q4, if you will, so it was very much on a global basis. And markets such as the Germany were strong, Philippines, India, U.S. domestic, so it was really around the globe where we did see strength for the most part. Again, there are some challenges in certain geographies, but as we look at the C2C margins, they were down about 90 basis points, if you will. Year-over-year, marketing was up about 60 basis points, but on a full year basis we'll run marketing right around 4% of revenue, so you will get some variation quarter-to-quarter. We also had some costs for the Costa and Finint integration. Again, as we move through the year, we think that will be helpful to margins. And then, just some timing of expenses. So nothing particular line of sight. I think it's a good execution around the globe and the benefit of having the portfolio of being in 200 countries. No country outside of the U.S. is greater than 6% of the top line, so the portfolio is definitely helping us.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just looking at the metrics, last year, C2C transactions started off the first quarter at 7%, then it went 6%, 5%, 5%, to fill out the -- 6%, 5%, 5% to fill out the rest of the year, so it decelerated slightly. I guess any thoughts on what the outlook might be for transaction growth? Will it remain at this 7% level? Will it increase; will it decrease a little bit, like it did last year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Bryan, in our business, it depends really change in by corridor-by-corridor and by quarter-by-quarter, right? But generally, I'm -- once again, I'm affirming my revenue guidance. I gave it beginning of the year. I feel quite comfortable with that. And we had a good quarter and a better quarter than last, Q4. And I think I'm pleased with the business results.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Last question for me, just on the Latin America region. I guess revenue grew 2% and then transactions grew at 8%, that's a 6-point delta, a little larger than typically we've seen. Can you just help us understand the delta there?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Bryan. There definitely was some currency impact there. So if you were to currency-adjust the lack of number, the 2% -- I'm not saying it would be 8%, but it would be 2% revenue growth would be closer to 8% than the 2% that you're saying. The delta would be much smaller.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just want to ask about the B2B, the Business Solutions segment. I didn't quite hear. How did that perform versus planned in the first quarter? And I think I heard that it was cyclically a little bit challenged, but I also wanted to confirm if we're still looking for $400 million for the year in terms of revenue.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, first, Tien-Tsin, we are -- as I mentioned before, we are committed to our low double-digit growth for the coming years. I think we did some -- see some softness in our U.S. and U.K. business due to global trade and due to currency volatility and -- but we did also very strong growth in our Australia business. I would say that the quarter came a little bit softer than I expected, but I am committed -- we are committed for the low double-digit growth.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, the only thing I would add, Tien-Tsin, from quarter to quarter in this business, you do see some variation in revenue growth rates. If you look at the second half of 2011, because there was a lot of currency volatility in the marketplace, you did see some higher growth rates and some variations among the quarter. While we think, in the first quarter, we had good -- very good growth in Australia, Asia Pacific, some softness in U.S. and U.K. Some of that is really due to trade being a little bit soft and then just, I'd say, lack of currency volatility. But we are committed. I -- we see line of sight to growing that business low double-digit, pro forma revenue growth for 2012 and right around that $400 million of revenue that you asked about.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. So some of it is going be easier comps around FX volatility, but did you also sign some new distribution points as well? I'm just trying to...", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, absolutely, Tien-Tsin. We are -- as you recall, we were in 16 countries as we acquired Travelex and put them together. Now we are in 25 countries. We just announced the -- one of the biggest pension payments organization in U.K., Mercer, and they are paying out to U.K. pensions and retirement people in 80 countries, so I think we are getting new accounts here. So the -- we have sales people that are quite active. And our agents. I just came back from Asia, from Indonesia and I met some agents there. They are very excited about the opportunity to launch new services B2B.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. Last one, just sort of a bigger picture question, I'm sure you'll talk about this at the Analyst Day. But WU Pay, I've just been doing some work around that area. Is it fair, Hikmet, to call this your, I don't know, a digital cash wallet, maybe...", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I'm curious, is it live now? What's the activity like? How many billers do you have? And is it -- should we think about this potentially being added to other marketplaces in the future? I'm just curious what the quick plan is on that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Absolutely. I think it's too early. We are going to give you more color, as you say it, in May 9. But you could -- you may call it a wallet, but I call it WU Pay. It really gives the capability to the -- to our customers to use also not only their account from a credit card fund, their account from a credit card, but also cash funding. Many customers are not -- don't want to give -- purchase online goods, don't want to give their credit card numbers or online account numbers. They can go through 1 of the 500,000 locations in the future. Now it's only in the U.S. but also in the future -- and pay their bills there. So that gives the capability. And the good thing here also, we want to also add that on our westernunion.com, which is growing, by the way, by 40%, as you know. And having direct access to the customers, their accounts, I think it's a -- that's the eBillme, which we acquired about 6 months ago, and now we changed it to WU Pay. We are using our existing brands, Western Union brands, and promoting that to our new potential customers.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. So Tien-Tsin, it's live for online payments to merchants. So we've got several hundred merchants there where they're connected to. And then it'll be live for payment on westernunion.com in the next couple of months.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess my first question is -- you do have, this year, several major renewals in C2C. What should we expect from that? I mean, lower commission rates, is that on the table? Exclusivity? Any comments yet on those things?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, we -- as you know, Ashwin, we have some principles. I think we like our brand, we like our exclusivity because I believe that our brand attracts customers to the point of sale. And we would like to protect our brand and protect our premium pricing. This kind of -- depending also about the market, of course, but generally we are in line with our principles here. Of course, we want to expand our -- we have now our -- today is a big day for Western Union. We opened our 500,000th locations. Actually, we are going to open in lunch time our 500,000th location with a press conference, everything. And I would like to expand our touch points. As I mentioned at the last conference call, we are having a target of what, 1 million touch points globally to reaching our bands. We are going to -- aggressively going to sign new agents. We're going to -- but also improving our margins. Over the years, our costs of sales have been decreasing, and we would like to go that path. And we hired new sales people. One of the biggest investments we did the last 2 quarters are hiring new sales people on the field and expanding our sales approaches. That's going to continue.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And moving to the B2B, can you comment on the relative importance to revenue growth of things like currency volatility versus new client signings, trade trends? What's sort of a -- actually, if you can just comment on the relative importance of that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, obviously, the existing customers\u2019 revenue has to grow because it's a core in the B2B, right? I mean, that has -- we saw some impact here, with the exits in North America and U.K. Part of the world which the currency exchange rate was favorable to us with the -- where the -- our existing customer wants to trade, they use us, like in Australia and Asia. New agents, new -- sorry, new client signings are very aggressive. We are -- as I mentioned before, we are in 25 countries. We are signing new ones and it takes some time until they come up with revenues. But one of the new Western Union, you will see that be more aggressive at the market and signing new clients. And we are doing that, and within the -- it has been only a few months we acquired Travelex and we put it on the Western Union Business Solutions. We started with 16 countries; we are already in 25 countries. That impact will take some time, but you'll see it.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And I'd just add, Ashwin, that our global market share is right around 2%, so we really have an opportunity to globalize this market. It's very underserved. And we believe our brand, our global footprint, our compliance capabilities, all those things play very well to globalizing this space over the coming years.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Understood. One housekeeping question. Share count did not go down in spite of the buyback. Was that timing in the quarter, or issuance? I mean, can you comment on that?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "The -- it'd probably just be timing because what you're probably referring to is that both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we had roughly 622 million shares -- diluted shares outstanding that we are focused on. Yes, it would just be timing, if you will. What I will say with stock buyback, since we're on that topic, is that we bought back about 115 million -- I'm sorry, about 150 million shares -- $150 million worth of our stock. We plan to be active. Our buyback levels are probably somewhere in the range of at least on 2009, 2010, so $400 million to $600 million, somewhere in that range, from that standpoint.", "Michael A. Salop", "And Ashwin, we've called out, at the end of quarter there were 614 million basic shares outstanding.", "Operator", "And next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one quick housekeeping question. Can you go back through the domestic international and Mexico transaction and revenue growth numbers, per the old disclosures, so we make sure we have those mapping correctly?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure. The domestic business had 12% transaction growth in the quarter and 9% revenue growth, so very solid in the first quarter. And then the Mexico business, Julio, had transactions and revenue both growing at 3% in the first quarter.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then the international piece? Sorry.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Oh, the international piece, you would see 6% transaction growth and 4% constant currency revenue growth on the international piece.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And obviously, we've talked a lot about the Business Solutions piece. In terms of revenue improvement, it sounds like you guys reaffirmed the $400 million. I guess I'm just trying to get more specifics on what is it that gives you guys the confidence in the line of sight, if you will, on the improved revenue performance with Business Solutions segment.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think, first of all, we believe that the existing customers are going to use as we -- as the currency exchange rate changes. And it has -- it's nothing, Julio, it's nothing -- it happens in this business, depending on the quarters, depending on the months when the trades happening, that's one. And secondly also, the new signings are coming very strong and we are signing new clients here. That's makes me comfortable with $400 million.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. Yes, I think I mean -- for us, I mean, obviously this is an area that's a little bit newer in terms of trending out and trying to understand what the drivers are. So I mean, at this point, if you had to make a suggestion on what we would -- what we should be focusing on, it sounds like FX volatility might be something to be tracking. Are there any other sort of macro metrics or external data points that you would suggest would also be important indicators for the business, though?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, that's the first one. And the second one, I will definitely add the global trade, especially for the SMEs. The global trade within the SME sector is something that you may have a look.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the bill payment business, obviously the -- well, that, the disclosure in terms of the margins does give us a pretty nice look in terms of the margin profile of that business now that we can sort of see that separate from the Business Solutions segment. I'm trying to understand what you guys think is kind of the margin profile of that business longer term. Obviously, some benefits post the debit interchange rule changes, et cetera and much stronger performance and, I think, what we were even thinking about here in terms of the model. But where do you think that margin goes from here? And what are the most important drivers over the longer term for the bill payment segment, if you will?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "The drivers, like it would be for most businesses, is top line revenue growth. And on a constant currency basis for revenues we\u2019re up 3% in the first quarter. Now as we move through the year, we may see some -- because of Durbin and some pass-through, may see some impact on the top line. But we see the C2B business as being steady, for sure, Julio, from that standpoint. And so a key driver of the margins will be the revenue growth. Without getting real specific, I mean I do feel comfortable that it's a type of business that it's going to have a margin that will at least have a 2 in front of it, as we move forward. It's a good business. It's in the U.S.; it's in Argentina and we're doing some things internationally, and it complements our money transfer business very well. And I think it will be a very profitable business with at least 2 in front of the margin as we move forward, for sure.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Glenn Fodor of Morgan Stanley.", "Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is Vasun Govil for Glenn. Can you just quickly update us on the compliance situation in Mexico, how that is progressing and by when do you expect to be in some compliance?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I think, as we mentioned in our February Earning Calls, we have been working with the appointed external monitor very close and to terminate -- appreciate changes, which was outlined in our agreement, and improvements about anti-money laundering oversight along all the border. I think we did do some changes last year on Vigo and on Orlandi Valuta brands and also on our brand's ID threshold changes which has impacted our high-principal transfers which we still see it. And currently, we are also investing on the new technology changes. And we have other many projects underway. So we believe that these changes have affected our principal and market share in 2012, but we also believe that these changes are needed. These changes are happening and we've been -- we're going to be the -- as an industry leader, we are implementing the changes. And that will also impact all the industry long term, yes.", "Vasundhara Govil - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then just also recently, research piece by the Pew Hispanic Center seemed to suggest that migration from Mexico to U.S. has steeply declined and that there's actually a reversal of trend where Mexicans are leaving the U.S. and that trend has picked up. Can you comment on that and how you see that impacting long-term growth in that corridor?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we believe that Mexico corridor for us is a very important corridor, right? I think we are going to -- we believe there's still room to grow. I believe that we're going to continue to invest on that. I didn't see any big changes on our current business impacted by migration changes, but as I said, the biggest impact has been around our compliance programs.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. And I'll just say, as reminder, I think everyone probably knows this, but part of what we're saying is that Mexico is only about 6% of our top line, so it's one of many markets. When you think about a portfolio of business, Mexico is an important market but just 1 of 200 countries.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And these changes have been in 200 countries, and in many, many years, many migration regulations, all this has been here, so...", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Kissane of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Have you seen any improvement in Italy since the tax was rescinded, I guess, about a month ago?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I would say that, generally we don't give specific country numbers in -- but I would say, generally, this implementation has been for all country. It's -- doesn't impact Western Union or the others. And the Southern European area stays as a challenging area, still. We do see in total in Europe business a little bit improvement, but in Southern Europe, I would say that we are -- I'm still cautious there.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And Scott, just to clarify: Higher FX volatility is actually positive for B2B, right, because you can generate a bigger spread? Is that the case? So you have actually more difficult comps in the back half of the year. Is that...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "What -- where volatility really helps us is it just creates, if you will, Jim, uncertainty in the marketplace. And so customers are more likely to be active trading forwards or options, if you will, if the currency\u2019s, if you will, moving all over the board. So it generally incites people to come into the market and, if you will, transact.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So you don't get a higher spread, is what you're saying when it's...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "It can vary a tad bit, but it's not a big factor. It's really just the volatility drives, if you will, customers into the market because of some uncertainty of where rates might end up, right? High or low, good or bad, depending upon where you're standing.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got you. And just longer term, where do you see B2B margins, say, 3, 4 years out?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Jim, I think that is a very leveragable business model, so as we look 3 to 4 years out, I do see that the EBITDA margins can be somewhere around where we're seeing the company margins today of 30%. It's a very leveragable business model. We're spending $50 million to very well integrate the businesses in 2012. And I think that's going to give us really good technology, really good product offerings. And that fixed cost structure, if you will, we can leverage. And I see, down the road, we could have margins around -- EBITDA margins around that 30% spot.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Hikmet, at your Analyst Day in September of 2010, you highlighted reduction in agent commissions as these contracts come up for renewal as a major driver of a long-term margin expansion. How far are you through that cycle of reducing agent commissions? And can you quantify expected savings for this year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally, as you know, over the years, our agent agreements are long-term agreements in 5- to 7-years agreement. And we have about -- it gives out many, many thousands of agents, which gives us 500,000 locations, so depending on the country, depending on the cycle of the agents. But generally, we are driving our costs down. We had -- cost of -- what was the costs on the...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, if look at -- David, cost of services in 2010 x onetimers was about 57% of our revenues, if you will. And then if you fast-forward that to full year 2011, it's 56%, so down about 100 basis points, our cost of services as a percentage of revenue.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And as we move forward with the agent negotiations, we are still targeting lower commission rates. But it's also a win-win situation. Agents also have to win. We have to win. I think, generally, the direction is we are having lower costs of services.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Do you have a target for cost of services for this year and next?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We didn't disclose that, but generally, it's in line with our -- we are keeping it, let me say, lower.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, I'd say, David, we have a spot that we want to get to. We've got, like every business, a 3-year business plan, so we have a roadmap of where we want to head. But without getting into a lot of specifics, for a pot of reasons, one of our objectives in 2012 near term is to have 26% operating margins, 30% EBITDA margins. And a combination of revenue growth, productivity initiatives such as agent commissions offset by some investment spending will allow us to get to those 26% margins.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just finally, on capital deployment. You indicated a target repurchase this year of $400 million to $600 million. What should we expect for dividend policy this year? And are you done with big deals for now?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "I would say on -- let me start with the acquisition front. We'll continue to look at things, David, but near term, I don't see us doing any sizable acquisitions, if you will, from that standpoint. From a return of capital, clearly, investing in the business is important. As I mentioned, I don't see any large acquisitions in the near term. And then, getting our capital back to our shareholders is very important. About 60 days ago, early February, we increased our dividend by 25%. It has roughly a 2% yield right now, but we also believe, given where the stock price is at, that it's undervalued. We think it's important to being -- to buying back the stock. As we look forward, the management team will work with our Board. We continue to want to have a balanced payout, all things being equal. And if the business performs, we'd like to move the dividend along, too, if the business performs.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So does that mean the payout ratio will increase this year?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "No, I don't have --- I'm not giving you specific targets for 2012. We just did raise the dividend by 25% in February. And I think, historically, we've got a very good track record of raising the dividend at least annually.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to start with a question on the principal per transaction growth. I think that metric, even in constant currency, slipped a little bit this quarter, which you highlighted on one of your slides. I wanted to just get a sense of whether that was due to Europe or any specific corridors. And do you expect it to stay in slightly negative territory for the next couple of quarters?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Jason. Really, I would point you to just a couple markets. And again, it's the portfolio approach of being in 200 countries. But Russia where we have some challenges, that carries a higher average principal per transaction. So when that business is soft, it has, if you will, a bigger impact on the consolidated number. And then, also China. For example, out of Argentina to China, we're seeing some very high dollar sends. And for a number of reasons, we pulled back on that business. So the Russia and the China corridors are impacting that principal per transaction. I think what's key with our business, the biggest driver behind our revenue is the customer and the transaction, getting the customer in the front door, whether it's retail or electronic, and that's what drives the revenue growth.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Also, DMT has an impact.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. And DMT had somewhat of an impact because of the $5 for $50. DMT continues to be successful, with 12% transaction growth and 9% revenue growth.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right, right. Okay, that's helpful. And just to pick up on a couple of your earlier comments. Scott, I think you had referenced your 3-year business plans and you did talk a little bit about, over the next 3 to 4 years, where you see B2B margins specifically could go. Just given the fact that you guys obviously are in investment mode as it relates to electronic channels and talking about some of the longer-term payoffs there, what will be the right time for you guys to talk about some longer-term financial targets in terms of ranges at least for overall revenue and EPS growth and potential margin trends? I mean, is that something that we can conceivably start hearing about at your analyst meeting next month, or are we going to have to wait a bit longer than that?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Jason, I think you're going to -- at the Analyst Day, we've got our -- Hikmet and myself and our 50 business leaders. We're going to talk a lot about our strategy of where we're heading not only near term but long term from that standpoint. And the objective at the Analyst Day would -- is to, if you will, give you all the building blocks, if you will, so on a long-term basis, you can kind of take your view of what is the revenue growth, the margin profile, EPS. But we'll really give you those building blocks and strategies that I think will be helpful as you look out the next 3 or 4 years.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. As we stay still very optimistic, and we're -- I'm looking forward to the next years, coming years. I mean, we did give some indications, like the westernunion.com, like having a $0.5 billion business year 2015. We give some indications on the Western Union Business Solutions and all these things. And you're going to get more color. And I just wanted to extend my invitation to all on the call again for the Investors Day in New York, May 9. That will really give you more color about the new Western Union, about how we change and to take the company to the next stage adding new products and new services. I think that will give a kind of -- for you an indication of where The Western Union could be in 3, 4 years.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And just last for me. Any update on PSD initiatives in Europe perhaps in terms of incremental agent locations you've been able to secure or any other metrics you're in a position to share?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Certainly. On the PSD, we added about -- we're almost at 10,000 locations. We are at -- on 9,000 -- more than 9,000 locations. I think we are expanding very good there. So it's all -- the 10,000 locations are of course in only the retail locations, which we were not -- in the past, not allowed to open. Now we can open them. I think it brings us additional revenue. I'm pleased with the progress we are doing with the PSD.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "As a follow-up to Bryan's earlier question with regard to the branch buildout, Hikmet, I think you've been pretty clear you've -- that's one of your initiatives in terms of accelerating the growth and increasing the Western Union footprint. Do you have some thoughts as to when we may see the benefits of that initiative in terms of faster C2C revenue growth? Are we seeing that today? What kind of payback from a timing perspective do you expect on those investments?", "Hikmet Ersek", "First of all, our business is growing with the expansion of our network. I mean, that\u2019s very clear. We've been -- I've been now with the company 13 years, and I remember as we celebrate our 100,000 locations. Now we are celebrating today our 500,000 locations. So that has been -- without that expansion, we wouldn't be so successful. I just want to remind you that a few years ago we had a 7% market share, and we are now around 17-plus-percent market share on the remittance market, cross-border marketed. And that's due to expansion of our network. And we have this vision of having 1 million locations because that gives also not only on the core business, which we believe it's going to grow transfer location-to-location, money transfer, but it also has this big impact to our westernunion.com, WU Pay, really connecting electronic with locations. Nobody in minutes can pay for -- from so many countries to 500,000 locations from westernunion.com. I could, say now as I'm sitting in New York, send money to anywhere to 200 countries, to 500,000 locations in minutes money. So that's going to expand, that's -- we have these 1 million touch point. One other thing is also, as you know, recently we've launched ATM Money Transfer in Italy; we launched ATM Money Transfer in Japan; we launched ATM Money Transfer in Turkey. So it's not only working in other location, it's also using the electronic in a different way. And we're going to continue that. I mean, it's already paying back. Westernunion.com wouldn't grow almost 40% if you wouldn't have the location globally. So the team is very focused, and I'm very pleased with the progress.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So maybe think about the branch buildout strategy as part and parcel of the kind of growth we've seen in the last couple years, and maybe cyclical factors are going be more of an impact on the C2C transaction revenue growth prospectively?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I can give you more color in May 9 meeting and so you're going to hear it more. But the other thing also, what brings us the location expansion is adding new products like our stored value products, prepaid cards. I think we have -- and you're going to see that we have this vision, as we are the biggest money transfer network of the world, we would like to have been also the biggest pre-load and cash-out network of the world. And to do that, I think we have to expand on our brand health, our agent network health, our presence in 200 countries and the regulatory environment health.", "Michael A. Salop", "Great. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us. As Hikmet mentioned, we do have our Investor Day on May 9 in New York, so we hope you'll be able to join us there as well. And I wish you all a good day.", "Operator", "The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP, Chief Financial Officer in Global Operations, will discuss 2012 second quarter results. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.", "Slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone. We remain focused on delivering on our vision to become the premier financial service provider for the underserved under the globe -- around the globe, as we outlined at our recent investors day in May. Our foundation is strong, with a solid core business in consumer money transfer and significant competitive strength, such as our agent network, our high brand awareness with the underserved around the world, our global compliance capabilities and our global organization and resources.", "We have the right strategies in place to capitalize on these strengths and drive accelerated growth over the long term by focusing on expanding our network and increasing consumer retention in Global Consumer Financial Services; expanding penetration and adding new services in Business Solutions; and developing and growing new services for the underserved in Ventures.", "Investments we have made in Business Solutions and Ventures are providing us diversified revenue streams. And as we accelerate growth over the long term, we expect to drive margin expansion. We also continue to focus on generating strong cash flow and deploying it for our shareholders.", "In 2012, we remain on track for the revenue, earnings per share and cash flow outlook we provided at the beginning of the year despite economic challenges.", "In the second quarter, our consumer money transfer business, which represented over 80% of revenues, continued to deliver solid results, We can see constant currency revenue increased 3%, with consistent year-over-year operating margins. There were some very strong large markets, such as Germany, Saudi Arabia and India, that helped offset economic softness in southern Europe and expected challenges in Mexico and Russia.", "westernunion.com online money transfer also continued to deliver strong growth. Interestingly, we are seeing some changes in consumer movements developing from the economic situation is southern Europe. Portugal, which was historically being primarily a send market, is now almost even split between inbound and outbound. Although Greece is still primarily an outbound market, the inbound business increased significantly and represented almost 30% of the country's mix through the first half of the year.", "Through our global network and local market expertise, we are very well positioned to react quickly to these changes in patterns. We are also making more progress ramping up our agent location expansion, including some key retailers in Europe, such as Lottomatica, in terms of locations, one of the largest retailers in Italy.", "We now have approximately 510,000 agent locations globally, but there are also an additional 50,000 money transfer touch points throughout ATMs and other transaction-capable spots. It is a great base to achieve our long-term goal of 1 million touch points. Our access to consumers is even higher when you consider the millions of account holders that can utilize our services throughout online banking and mobile phones.", "We have agreed to add account-based money transfers with large banks in India and China, and we will continue to expand our services to offer even more convenience and choice to our consumers. Our account-based money transfer momentum remained strong, with revenue growth of 34% in the quarter.", "Turning to Business Solutions. Pro forma constant currency revenue growth was the same as the first quarter at 4%. Although we have tempered our 2012 expectation for this business, primarily due to the impact of slowdowns in global trade, we have not changed our long-term outlook.", "B2B business development remained strong, as we recently signed new partners, such as ICICI Bank, through which we will transact international student tuition payments from India on behalf of our university customers; and IBInvestor in the U.S., a global business incubator for media companies. We also expanded Business Solutions to its 26th active country by partnering with our agent in Chile.", "We continue to believe we will obtain double -- low double-digit revenue growth in B2B over the next several years as the global expansion and new customer acquisition become more material components of our business.", "In Ventures, westernunion.com continues to deliver strong growth while we invest in new capabilities. We are piloting new strategies and pricing actions to drive customer acquisition, upgrading platforms to increase functionality and improve the consumer experience and building highly skilled team at our new San Francisco office.", "There will continue to be enhancements to our services throughout the year, which will position us well for the future growth. There's also major activity in our stored value business. Our U.S. prepaid card distribution will be getting a boost from the signings of retailers, such as Dollar General, which will add thousands of locations over the next several quarters. And our global expansion continues as we'll shortly be launching special receiver-focused prepaid cards in the Philippines. We are building a solid foundation for stored value, and these recent actions are major steps to drive growth in the future.", "Finally, we continue to deploy our capital for shareholders, buying back over $160 million of stock and paying over $60 million in dividends in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have now returned over $430 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividends and plan to continue to pursue strong deployments throughout the year.", "So our core business is sound, and our cash generation is strong. We are executing against our strategic plans and look forward to advancing them further to accelerate our growth over the long term.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the quarter, I would like to turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. Overall for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Consolidated pro forma revenue increased 2% constant currency, including Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, reported revenue was flat with the prior year period on transaction growth of 4%. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% in the quarter.", "Second quarter constant currency growth rates were below first quarter trends, primarily due to some additional economic softness in southern Europe and the expected challenges in Russia and Mexico. We had slightly lower growth in the U.S. Global distribution of our portfolio helped stabilize us against isolated regional dynamics, and strong growth in countries such as Germany, Saudi Arabia and India helped drive overall growth.", "B2C cross-border principal declined 2% in the quarter, but increased 1% on a constant currency basis. B2C principal per transaction declined 6% year-over-year, with 3% on a constant currency basis, which was consistent with the first quarter.", "Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of consolidated revenues, decreased 8% year-over-year. This decline included a negative 5% impact from currency translation.", "Russia is generally tracking to our outlook, as it will take 2012 to implement our turnaround strategies, including building a retail network. Germany  continued strong growth, while other large markets, such as the U.K. and France had been stable. Economic conditions in southern Europe have led to further declines in Italy and Spain.", "Turning to North America. Revenue was flat with the prior year period on 2% transaction growth, and the region represented 21% of total company revenue. U.S. outbound revenue increased, although not as strong as the first quarter, while domestic money transfer revenue grew 4% on transaction growth of 7% in the quarter.", "Domestic $5 for $50 continues to have strong growth even compared to very high growth rates in the prior year. Some of the higher-tier bands did not increase as fast, and we are implementing new marketing programs to drive further growth. Mexico revenue declined 7% and transactions decreased 5% in the quarter.", "As you recall, we anticipated revenue declines and share losses in Mexico this year, as we implement changes to our compliance-related practices and business model.", "Results were strong in the Middle East and Africa region. Revenue in the quarter increased 3%, including a negative 3% impact from currency. Transactions grew 9%. Saudi Arabia and much of Africa were key drivers of the growth.", "The Asia Pacific region revenue grew 4%, including a negative 2% impact from currency translation. Aside from the currency impact, trends were consistent with the first quarter. India contributed strong growth, while the revenue decline in China moderated from the first quarter rate.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region reported strong results, again, in the quarter. Revenue grew 5%, including a negative 2% impact from currency and improved slightly relative to the first quarter growth rate.", "westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 23%, including a 4% negative impact from currency translation. We introduced some fee promotions in certain corridors in the quarter to attract new customers, which negatively impacted revenue in the short term, but should aid future growth. westernunion.com transaction growth was a very healthy 35% in the quarter. As a reminder, westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates for the other 5 regions, although they are included when we discuss specific country trends.", "Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, as well as account-based money transfer and mobile, increased 26% in the quarter and represented 3% of total company revenue. westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 23% in the quarter, and revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 34%. We now have nearly 100 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with 47 launched. We also have nearly 30 mobile network contracts, with 13 actively operating.", "Prepaid revenue increased 6% in the quarter. And total prepaid, including third-party top-up, represented just under 1% of company revenue. We expect prepaid revenue growth to increase in the second half of the year, as we benefit from greatly expanded distribution in the U.S. and some of the international introductions.", "We will roll out our cards to Dollar General's 10,000 locations, as well as adding Fred's general merchandise stores. We're also continuing to ramp up distribution at the 7-Eleven convenience stores. The prepaid cards were available at approximately 22,000 retail locations globally, including over 21,000 locations in the U.S. at the end of the quarter, and the new agreements will represent a significant step-up in our distribution.", "Turning back to the total C2C business. Spread between transaction revenue growth in the quarter was 1 percentage point, excluding the impact from currency, which negatively impacted the spread by 3 points. The impact of net price decreases was approximately 1% in the second quarter, while mix was neutral.", "Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue decreased 3% in the quarter and was flat on a constant currency basis. South American business continues to grow, while the U.S. revenue is still stabilizing, but was affected by business mix and the passing through of some of the debit fees savings related to Durbin  in the quarter.", "Business Solutions reported revenue of $92 million in the quarter, which compared to $31 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, including TGBP results in the prior year, Business Solutions revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis, which was consistent with the first quarter. We are below our revenue plan in Business Solutions and have lowered our full year outlook to mid-single digits revenue growth. Although our transaction growth in the quarter was low-double digits, our principal per transaction was down, which is consistent with economic slowdowns in key markets.", "In the near term, Business Solutions results are largely driven by the amount of principal existing customer sends. Over time, the new customer acquisition and geographic expansion will become more meaningful parts of the growth. When integration is completed and the new customer business grows, we remain confident Business Solutions can deliver revenue growth in low-double digits over the next several years.", "Turning to consolidated margins. Second quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 24.3% compared to 25.7% in the prior year. Excluding $14 million of Travelex integration expenses, consolidated margin was 25.3% compared to 26.3%, excluding $9 million of restructuring expense in the prior year period.  Operating margin of 25.3%, excluding TGBP integration expense, is an increase from 24.3% in the first quarter. EBITDA margin, excluding integration expense, was 29.3% compared to 29.7%, excluding restructuring expenses in the second quarter of last year.", "Consumer-to-consumer operating margin was relatively flat compared to prior year. Consolidated margins declined primarily due to the incremental $10 million of depreciation and amortization in Business Solutions.  Consolidated margin was also negatively impacted by investments in westernunion.com and additional compliance costs, mostly related to the Southwest Border. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from currency, lower bank fees related to Durbin, fuel costs in the prior year, restructuring savings and lower marketing expense.", "We realized approximately $18 million in restructuring savings in this year's second quarter compared to $13 million of savings in the prior year period. As we mentioned at our May 9 investor day, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remittance disclosure rules is going to add some expense in 2012 that is incremental to our previous outlook. We have completed detailed implementation plans to prepare our systems, call centers and entire agent location network in the U.S. for adoption of these rules by early 2013.", "We expect incremental expense of approximately $15 million in 2012 to cover the requirements for our consumer money transfer, bill payments, Ventures and Business Solutions businesses. These costs include expedited implementation of enhancements to our point-of-sale system at many U.S. agent locations, training for the agents, IT development, call center costs for new error resolution procedures, expenses related to the creation and distribution of new receipt forms. We'll have some small onetime cost to complete implementation in early 2013, that we estimate at around $5 million to $10 million of ongoing annual cost related primarily to call center time and additional forms.", "We have also adjusted our full year 2012 outlook for operating margins to reflect higher spending for other compliance costs, primarily relating to the Southwest Border agreement. We're working on dozens of projects around enhanced risk controls and have continued to evolve. We have increased our projected spend in 2012 primarily for IT development and higher personnel costs.", "We expect global spending on compliance activities over the next couple of years will not change significantly from the 2012 levels. While the breadth and complexity of requirements and sustainability around the globe continues to expand, we view our ability to adapt to this environment as a long-term competitive advantage.", "Turning back to the second quarter. Other income and expense of $36 million of expense increased $17 million from last year, as the 2011 period included a $29 million gain on the remeasurement of our equity position in Angelo Costa.", "Tax rate in the quarter was 12.5%, which compares to 21.1% in the second quarter of last year. Decrease in our tax rate is primarily due to the resolution of the treatment of our international operations, as we noted in the announcement of our agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service last December. In addition, in the current quarter, we had a non-reoccurring benefit related to favorable resolution of certain foreign and U.S. tax positions. For the full year, we now expect a tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which is lower than the previous outlook due to the non-reoccurring benefit in the current quarter.", "Earnings per share in the quarter are $0.44 compared to $0.41 in the prior year. EPS was $0.46 excluding Travelex integration expenses, which compared to $0.42, excluding restructuring charges in the prior year. The prior year EPS included a gain of $0.03 related to the Angelo Costa remeasurements. Excluding integration expense in the current quarter and restructuring expenses in the prior year period, earnings per share increased 10%.", "C2C operating segment margin was 28.5% compared to 28.6% in the same period last year and an improvement from 27.7% in the first quarter. Compared to prior year, the margin benefited from currency, lower average commission rates and lower marketing, but these benefits were offset primarily by higher compliance costs, Costa and Finint acquisition-related costs and investments in westernunion.com.", "Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 22.4% in the quarter compared to 24.6% in the prior year period. Margin decreased primarily due to geographic and product mix and some higher bank fees, partially offset by decreased debit fees related to Durbin.", "Business Solutions reported operating loss of $15 million for the quarter compared to an operating loss of $2 million in the prior year period. Last year's loss does not include Travelex Global Business Payments. This quarter's $15 million loss includes $15 million of depreciation and amortization, with $14 million of Travelex integration expense. There is approximately $1 million that is included in both amortization and integration expense.", "Depreciation and amortization in last year's second quarter was $5 million. We continue to expect Business Solutions profitability, excluding integration expenses, to improve throughout the second half of the year, as we benefit from better revenue leverage and initial cost savings from synergies.", "Turning to our cash flow and our balance sheet. We continue to have a strong position. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $446 million, which include the impact of approximately $100 million of tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. We currently do not expect to make additional payments related to this agreement until 2013.", "Capital expenditures in the quarter were $46 million or 3% of revenue. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be 4% to 5% of revenue for the full year due to increased signing bonuses on some major agent contract renewals and new signings, as well as investments in technology. We expect capital expenditures to return to approximately 3% of revenue on average after 2012, although any given year could be impacted by additional new agent signings or other initiatives.", "Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $59 million in the quarter. At quarter end, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately half of the cash was in the United States. We continue our strong capital deployment policies. We repurchased approximately 10 million shares, totaling $163 million in the second quarter at an average price of $16.87. This represents approximately 1.5% of the total shares outstanding.", "In addition, we paid out $61 million in dividends during the quarter. As of June 30, our shares outstanding were 604 million shares, and we had approximately $305 million remaining in our existing repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2012. We remain committed to continuing with strong return of funds to shareholders during the remainder of the year and beyond.", "Turning to our outlook for the full year. We are affirming the revenue outlook provided on April 24. We are reducing our operating margin outlook due to the incremental compliance costs, and we are slightly increasing the earnings per share outlook, primarily to reflect the non-reoccurring tax benefit recorded in the second quarter. We have also increased the operating cash flow outlook due to the timing of tax payments.", "For the company overall, we are maintaining our revenue outlook, which includes: 6% to 8% constant currency revenue growth, including a 4% benefit from the full year inclusion of Travelex; and GAAP revenue growth 2% lower than constant currency.", "Turning to margins. We have adjusted our operating margin ranges for 2012 due to the increased compliance-related costs relative to our original outlook. The incremental cost include the $15 million related to Dodd-Frank and additional spending primarily related to the Southwest Border. The current outlook for margins is approximately 24.5% for GAAP or 25.5% excluding the Travelex integration costs.", "The outlook for EBITDA margins, excluding integration, is consistent with our previous outlook, at approximately 30%. We are now projecting an effective tax rate of 15% to 16% for the year, down 1% from the previous outlook due to the non-reoccurring benefit recorded in the second quarter.", "The high end of our earnings per share outlook has been increased by $0.02 compared to our previous outlook, as we have also -- and we have also narrowed the range, although our operating margin outlook is lower, which is being offset by the lower tax rate and slightly lower expenses in other income and expense.", "Our assumptions for share repurchases have not changed. Our updated earnings per share outlook is GAAP EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.72, which compares to $1.65 to $1.70 in the previous outlook; EPS, excluding Travelex integration expense, of $1.73 to $1.77, which compares to $1.70 to $1.75 previously.", "Our outlook for cash flow from operations has increased by $100 million due to the timing of the estimated tax payments related to the December 2011 agreement with the IRS. The new outlook is a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, including payments of $100 million that have already been made relating to the IRS agreements. There are approximately $90 million in tax payments related to this agreement that remain to be paid, but we expect to pay the majority of those in 2013. Excluding these tax payments, our 2012 outlook for cash flow from operations remains consistent with the prior outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.", "Overall, we're on track to deliver our financial outlook despite the expected macro and other challenges and higher compliance costs as our diversified portfolio allows us to produce stable results and generate and deploy strong cash flow.", "Operator, we are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tien-Tsing Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just want to -- I guess, first on Business Solutions. The lower guidance isn't a surprise, but I'm curious. Is it all macro-related? Or did you see some challenges in your sales efforts as well? I'm just trying to better understand if improved distribution in loan can get you to double-digit growth next year if the macro situation stays the same. So that's why I want to parse those 2 together -- or parse those 2 out.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Tien-Tsin, this is Hikmet. Mainly -- it's mainly driven by the global trade. Our existing customers revenue in some parts of the world has been -- especially in the U.S. and some parts of western Europe, has been depending on the existing customer. It has been lower, and that's because of the global trade slowness. We do have new acquisitions. We do have new clients. As I mentioned before, ICICI Bank and the universities in the U.S. and also, IBInvestor kind of -- and we also opened a new country. As you recall, we started after the -- about 8 months ago, 10 months ago, we had 16 countries. Now we are in 26 countries in the Western Union Business Solutions. And the new revenue take some time, it comes. And our aim is expanding on to new countries. But I would say that's mainly driven by global trade has impacted our B2B business.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then the compliance cost moving up. Do you think this will eventually apply to some of your smaller peers as well and perhaps ease some of the competition, especially in pricing, going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, Tien-Tsin, it's upgrading our compliance. And as you know, we are very focused here, and we are very serious. It's a competitive advantage long term. I think we are investing heavily here to be really -- I think as an industry leader, we are setting the tone here. And I think we are very focused here, and I see that as a -- definitely a competitive advantage.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Glenn Fodor of Morgan Stanley.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question on B2B. I mean, just on the whole market share issue. I mean, people, I believe, are expecting you guys to offset any macro weakness with share gains. So just straight up, I mean, do you think you're winning share yet? And if not yet, when do you expect this to happen?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I believe we are gaining share. We are getting new customers. We are really gaining share. I think in some parts where we had the existing customers, as I mentioned before, we had some global trade issues. But generally, we are expanding and we are gaining share. I just want to repeat again. We have only 2% market share globally, and it can go only up. And the team is very focused to signing new sales efforts. I think, Glenn, we are definitely on the road gaining share.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then, on a normalized basis, excluding integration costs, it looks like you made some progress, by our calculations, in the operating margin in B2B from 1Q to 2Q. So can this trajectory continue even without an acceleration of the top line over the near term, just coming from synergies and cost optimization?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. Yes, Glenn. If you look at the first quarter compared to second quarter, if you just look at the EBITDA margins, excluding integration, EBITDA margins in the first quarter were about 8%. In the second quarter, they're about 15%. So they almost doubled it, if you will. And we did have some earlier upfront spending. We're beginning to see synergies. But it's a very leverageable business model. So as we bring the 2 businesses together to pick the best technology, the best products, get the talent aligned and go to market, we believe, over the years to come, this business can have EBITDA margins somewhere in the 30% range. And as we move through the year and move into 2013, we continue to expect to make progress. As we exit '13, we do believe we'll be on a run rate of about $30 million of expense synergies. So we want to continue to drive those margins north and believe we can.", "Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This $30 million, just to be clear, expense synergies with overall company or within the B2B segment?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Glenn, just within B2B. Within B2B, we see about $30 million of expense synergies, on a run rate, as we exit 2013.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "A little more color maybe on North America, Mexico and some of the troubled regions on some of the trends that you saw there. I mean, I think, you outperformed what you thought in the first quarter. You certainly had pointed towards trouble in Mexico in the second quarter. What were -- I mean, could you go over again the growth rates in North America, Mexico and what you expect over the next several quarters?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. Let me start with some color -- more color on North America, Bob. I think, the Mexico business, North America outbound to Mexico business has beating our expectations. We were expecting some slowdown due to our -- some changes we implemented in the Southwest Border area. And don't forget that it's about 25% of our revenue is from the South -- from the U.S. outbound to Mexico is coming from the Southwest Border area, 25%. So it has slowed down. We've put some higher restrictions there. We put some higher requirement for the customer. And I think, it impacted, short term, our business. Long term, we believe that we're going to be upgrading, and we're going to set some industry standards here. That has been from Mexico. Our DMT business in the U.S. is still growing well. Don't forget, we started about 2 years ago. Our pricing $5 for $50 has been growing over the years and still growing pretty well. And I think DMT has been a very strong business for us in the U.S. You want to add something?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "The only thing I would add that the third component of the North America business is U.S. outbound. And it continued to experience growth in the second quarter, not quite as strong as the first quarter, but it was still growing. And just to reiterate, with Mexico, it's really what we expected to have some challenges in 2012. As we work through evolving the business model and so forth, we believe that'll put us in a much more stronger position on a long-term basis with Mexico.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "If I could just follow up on westernunion.com and the prepaid business. I mean, prepaid only growing 6%. I just like a little more color on that. It seems like the industry is growing much faster, obviously. And then on westernunion.com, the gap between transactions and revenue growth, do you expect that to continue?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Let me start with westernunion.com maybe. So our target, $500 million in 2015, is still on. We are currently about $150 million business, and we would like to have that at $500 million business in 2015. So we are in plan. We're are  growing transactions about 35%. We did some fee promotions in Q2, which, gained new customers, and we've been very happy with the results in westernunion.com. So I'm very confident that the team is doing the right thing to grow that business -- continue to grow that business. That's the gap. Mainly the gap is between -- due to price promotions we have implemented in Q2. On the prepaid side, we -- don't forget, we have been quite limited on our expansion in the past, and now we are starting to get new retailers. We have about 21,000 retailers in the U.S. We added Dollar General. I believe it's going to be -- have a huge impact. It's our customer segment that is looking for kind of -- retail segment that's looking of kind of customer segment. I believe that will help us to grow the prepaid business also. You want to add something?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, the only thing I would add, in the second quarter specifically, is we did do some incentives, and those incentives impacted the revenue line on prepaid. So it was the 6% growth. We do expect, to Hikmet's point, stronger growth in the second half of the year and adding Dollar General, Fred's, spin up of 7-Eleven stores and then just some of the international markets, we're in Germany, U.K. Austria, we think, all of those things will be helpful to grow that business a little bit stronger as we move through the year with prepaid. But it's a nice opportunity because it's 1% of our revenue and globally, can leverage our brand, our distribution network and the hundreds of millions of customers we see every year. So it's -- near term, it won't be as meaningful. But long-term, it is a nice opportunity for us.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet, in a slowing economy, does Western Union have an advantage in maybe signing new agents or renegotiating agreements with them? As you look at the last recession we had, anything you can take from that, that if we do go through another slowing that you could have some advantages?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think, Kartik, our target signing new agents has not changed. If you look at that, we are at 510,000 locations. And we just have signed another 150 people on the sales force, on the market. And day-to-day, they are signing new agents, and we have been very actively purchasing that. I think I'm very confident that we're going to sign new agents. And definitely, in some environment it helps. Signing new agents means also adding new transactions. And we also -- besides that, we also added to going to new customer segment, about 50,000 ATMs globally. And if you go to Intesa Sanpaolo in Italy or if you go to 7-Eleven bank in Japan, the people are doing transaction via their ATMs. They use the ATMs to put their money transfer numbers, send or receive the money from that. So I believe I'm going to continue to, Kartik, look, to sign new agents.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then are you seeing any trends in the business maybe leading trends that would give you a look at maybe what's happening with the economy, something you saw last time the economy slowed? Anything in the trends that gives you concern?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I think the environment is tough out there, right? It has not been changed since our Q1. I think it's a tough environment. Southern Europe is definitely slowing down. We can see in our numbers. I would say the parts of the business are still holding pretty well. Germany, northern countries -- northern European countries, are holding. I mean, it's not that the major change happened since Q1 and Q2, but it's tough out there. And we are -- we believe that we are gaining market share by expanding our -- long term, I would say, we will gain market share by expanding our network. But it's tough there. I think the economy is not strong as that to help our business, right?", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then just one last question, Hikmet. What do you see the impact on the industry from all these new regulatory and compliance issues in terms of consolidation or pricing? What do you think the overall impact will be on the industry?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I believe, Kartik, that industry will upgrade -- has to upgrade their -- adapt their -- to the regulatory requirements. As the industry leader, obviously, we are very active here, upgrading, investing heavily on that. I think the industry has to follow that. While I can't make any comments to the competition, but I believe overall industry has to upgrade their requirements and adapt their requirements to the regulatory environment. Don't forget, we are in 200 countries. And every country has requirements, and some countries are more visible, some countries less. But we are adapting constantly to our regulatory environment.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Just circling back to the guidance questions. Again, given the macro headwinds, the slowdown in global trade and other challenges that are impacting the core consumer business, you still kept your full year revenue guidance unchanged. I'm wondering if there were some offsets that were not -- that you can call out as far as other areas of the business that were exceeding expectations. Or maybe just kind of add some other comments around why you kept the revenue guidance unchanged given those factors.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Tom, thanks for the question on this. Overall, if you look at the C2C business, it's 80% of our revenues, and that's had good, solid, consistent performance on a year-to-date basis. You're seeing growth. They're very strong there at the 4% range. So we're at the higher end just on a year-to-date basis. westernunion.com continues to grow well. We've seen growth rates in the 20s and 30s from a revenue standpoint. And then, although Business Solutions has been a tad bit softer than we expected, it is about 6% of our top line. But we believe long term, only having a 2% market share, leveraging our brand, our distribution, our global footprint, we can continue to grow in the low-double digit on a long-term basis. But overall, the core C2C business is strong. It's solid. We had consistent margins with a year ago, and so we feel good about where that business is at and where we're heading.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Great. And if I can ask a follow-up on westernunion.com, which seems to be a bright spot for you folks. What kinds of trends are you witnessing in that business in terms of some metrics, like customer retention and pricing? If you can compare that to kind of the traditional agent business. And although it's only 2% of revenue today, you have some potential growth [ph] there. Just trying to understand the economics there and some of those metrics, like customer retention.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. I mean, what we are doing here is that building on our fundamentals of our global network, global compliance capability and global brands. We are connecting electronic with locations with retail. No one, as Western Union, can connect 16,000 corridors with electronic and locations. We can -- no one else can send money from U.S. to New Zealand in minutes, that or to Chad or to Morocco in minutes than us. We can do that. So what we are doing is that seeing here a huge growth and it's also a different customer. The cannibalization is very, very low here. It's not the customer who are using retail-to-retail money transfer, it's a new customer segment. The cannibalization is really very low, and it helps to grow our business. So that helps our patterns. The pricing-wise, it's the similar pricing. We use it here. We do use some corridors -- pricing in some corridors to respond, but that's a similar also in the retail money transfer business, right? Corridor by corridor, you adapt your prices. But generally, I would say the margins are similar and the -- excluding the investments we did, I would say, this is similar business.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "While I think we all recognize there's been macro challenges impacting most businesses, you've -- and I think you may have touched on this in the -- earlier in the call a bit. But can you just perhaps call out and list off the issues that may have inhibited growth rates in C2C over the past year that are really not correlated with macroeconomic, such as regulatory issues, like those in Mexico and Russia or the pricing changes in Russia or the opportunities in Russia had an impact on market share? Anything else that may be unrelated to macro, but have inhibited growth and about how much it did sort of affect growth rate that could abate maybe and how that could trend better next year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. I can do that. I mean, no secret is the Mexico's Southwest Border investment that has been impacting our business. And we've been -- we think that, that has a part of our slowdown on our growth. And the other part is Russia. In Russia, it has been, as you know, we were kind of late to the market in Russia due to some regulatory changes. And since 1st of January, we could expand retail. We have team there. They are expending to the retail network like we did it in the PSD in the European Union. We had some issues in China. China slowed down, had impacted our business a little bit. Besides that, what else? I think 6% is only the B2B business, so global trades doesn't have an overall revenue impact. But on the C2C business, I would say these 3 areas had an impact to our business.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And if you were to sum up the impact of those 3 areas. And I think there's been a couple of other little smaller ones probably also. I mean, what would your -- what would you say was the total impact to your full year growth rate from those? If you can at least give us a sense?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Darrin, it's Scott. I would just probably characterize that if those markets were growing versus where they're at, it would be helpful to where we're at. But I don't want to put a precise a number on that because we're in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors. There's always some puts and takes. But I think the good news with each of those 3 markets: China, Russia and Mexico, we've got plans in place. So it will take us 2012 to execute and work through those plans. But hopefully, on a long-term basis, we'll be in a much better competitive position there.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Just to add on that, Darrin, largest market out of the U.S. is 6% of our revenue.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right, right. Understood. I guess I'm just trying to understand what a normalized growth rate would be even in a tough macro environment to compare now versus a normalized macro environment notwithstanding all the issues.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, sure. I know it's tough there. But we have, again, in the C2C a solid 3% growth, right? And I mean, I think that has been helping our business.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Just one quick follow-up question on the capital side. Obviously, there are still around 2/3, I think, of your cash flow generated outside the U.S. Any considerations recently by the board to adjust the strategy on capital? I know that you've been doing decently with the dividend and buybacks to some extent, but still a lot of cash can't be really easily used. And I know you have some near-term benefit from the tax benefit. But still, if you were to extrapolate or really just consider the repatriation of some of that cash more so maybe that would help or even leverage conditions would be considered differently that could maybe change the way some investors look at the story. Any thought there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think, we, obviously,  -- as management, I am constantly, with Scott together, reviewing our capital structure with the board. We are constantly talking about our strategies, capital structure on the board. If you look at our -- we are a very strong cash flow company. But if you look at that, we are -- our aim is returning back share -- cash to shareholders. And we were very active in the first 2 quarters. And I don't see a huge acquisition coming up from that. We recently had the acquisition with Travelex. We are very focused on integrating Travelex to the B2B business and growing that business, expanding to new countries. We recently opened Chile as a new country. I think we are very focused, and we are constantly reviewing with our board our capital structure.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask about southern Europe. I mean, does it feel like that's going to get worse before it gets better on an outlook perspective?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, it depends on -- I mean, in part of -- some parts of, like, Spain is still an issue, right? Some parts of the southern Europe is changing. We can see Portugal being 50% inbound, 50% outbound. The southern Europeans are going and other parts of Europe sending back home to their countries. The typical outbound countries tend to be a little bit also inbound countries, even Greece is 30% of inbound now. And I think it's depending. It's hard to say that it will change dramatically. I don't see big changes since Q1 and Q2. It's -- the slowdown continues. But it's hard to say that's is going to be hard or not. It's, I think -- I would say, cautiously -- I would stay cautious.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then when you look at your guys' metrics versus the World Bank or other competitors, do you feel like you're maintaining share? Or do you feel like there are a few regions that you guys are losing some share?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, Brian, you've been following our business for a long time. And generally, since 2001, we gained share. It was 7%, and now we are at 17% cross-border remittance [ph] market, if you compare it with Aite. And I think, in some years, we are gaining market share. In some years, we are losing market share. In some corridors, we are gaining in market shares. In some corridors, we are losing market shares. And our principal, the last 6 months, has been flat in 2012, and constant currency principal growth was about 2%. And just the projection of Aite, for instance, was 5% growth rate, but that was July 2011 last forecast. So I would put things in perspective. As I said, in some corridors, yes, some corridors they're adapting their market share. But overall, our aim long term is getting market share.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And last question for me, Scott, I know I got the additional color on some of the compliance costs. Do you have any idea if you think that will be an ongoing kind of a future cost to the business there? I think you said there's an additional maybe 10 million in the business. But I guess any idea if you feel the environment is becoming more compliant -- there's more compliance costs that are going to be out there that are going to continue to be in the business model going forward? I don't know if there's any way to give your kind of big picture thoughts on the rising cost of compliance even that might not be in the numbers?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Brian, as we've thought about that, it's hard to say for certain on anything because the compliance, the regulatory environment continues to evolve. But the overall spend in 2012, we think, comparable-wise, that's about where we're going to be in 2013 on a macro basis, specifically with Dodd-Frank. As an example, we think there'll be $5 million to $10 million of ongoing expenses  because of call centers and forms and so forth. But on a macro basis, we think the compliance spend '13 looks probably a lot like '12 just because of the broad global environment. But long term, we believe that will be competitive advantages for us as we move forward. And our goal is always to comply with the letter and spirit of the law, and we'll continue to drive that direction.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Hikmet, Scott, I just wanted to ask you to elaborate on the intra-quarter trend for C2C. Overall, the only geo with negative transaction growth was Europe. But -- just for Europe, as well as other geos, how did transactions trend each month in the quarter? And if you can possibly give some color on July, how it's looking?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Ashwin, yes. First I'd say the broad headline is we're confident with the guidance that we provided, the 2012 outlook we have provided today, for revenue growth, margins and EPS. So we're confident in the guidance that we provided. As you may recall, our historical practice is, we don't comment within a quarter or how the quarter looks because there can be seasonality, other things as you go within a quarter just looking at 1 month by itself. But the headline I would give you, Ashwin, is that we're comfortable with the guidance that we've provided today.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure. No, I certainly understand that. But when you look at sort of the sequential, I mean, Q2 is not as good as Q1, which is not a surprise to anyone. But is it continuing to get worse? Or has it stabilized? Your guidance would seem to imply it stabilized.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, we're -- again, I'd probably go back to we're confident in our full year outlook. If you compare the first quarter and the second quarter, Europe and the Americas -- North America had some slighter softness. But if you look at Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, each of those markets had growth rates that were very comparable to the first quarter. So they were strong. We saw good growth with India, Saudi Arabia, Germany and so forth. So that's the beauty of our business. We're in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors. It's a portfolio approach. So from quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month, you might have some puts and takes. But overall, within the 200 countries, we feel like we're driving in the right direction and doing the right things.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Understood. It's good to hear. I wanted to ask about pricing. It's still only a modest negative. It seems like it's lower than historical trend and except for sort of sporadic pricing initiatives. What's a good price trend line for the next 12 months? Negative 1 to negative 2 or will it get back to sort of the historical negative 2 to 3?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Ashwin, I think, generally, as you know, we are looking corridor by corridor in our pricing. We are going to -- in 2012, we're going to be around 1%, and 1% to 2% max, that will be the next forecast. I guess, given the environment, we are looking price and price action corridor by corridor, but I would say 1% to 2% around that will be in 2012 probably.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Scott, just a clarification on tax rate. Clearly, for this year, you get the non-repeating benefit. But the longer-term tax rate, should that still be in the 16%, 17% range?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, I would say directionally, yes, Ashwin, the only caution or caveat I'd put around that depends upon if there's tax law changes in any countries or how much cash we may repatriate. But your point is well taken. The benefit we have to the tax rate this year is more onetime, so we'll probably be closer to that 16% to 17% range unless other things might change. But there's a onetime benefit in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Jim Kissane of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Hikmet, can you provide a little more color in terms of your turnaround strategies for Mexico and Russia?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. Let me -- I think 2012 will be still, both countries, a little bit challenging until we turn around. I think we are investing on the Mexico and there are 2 different issues here. In Mexico, it's more about upgrading our compliance in the Southwest Border and other areas and setting here the industry standards that, long term, we are leading the standard. And I think in Russia, the issue is more than signing new retailers, signing new -- you know that in Russia, we have financial institutions, and we are leading the financial institution there. And we have a very good business. Now we are going to the retail sector and adapting our pricing, and we hired new sales people. It will take some time in 2012 turning around Russia. It will take probably 2013. And once we have signed the retailers, then we will also start with some promotions to attract back the customers to our locations. So it will be -- we'll see the turn around probably in '13.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So Hikmet, you think the compliance issues are the main problem in Mexico?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think in Mexico, one thing also happened is that we -- as the exclusivity ended, we are starting to negotiate with new agent, potential agents. I'm very -- as we speak, the team is there in Mexico. And I think we are very aggressively purchasing new agents there in Mexico. That will help also to grow our business long term in Mexico.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And what's driving the stronger performance in Latin America? Any particular corridors?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, in parts of Latin America, we've been very strong in the business. And we did -- in Latin America also, we see new corridors sending intra-Latin America corridors, not only country, but intra-countries within the countries also growing strong. Our B2B -- our business -- bill payment business is doing very good in Argentina and other countries. That helps also to grow our business there.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just one more question. Did FX volatility in the quarter help Travelex or the B2B business?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Not really. I think it was really the transaction principal growth was the impact. But not really, we didn't see a huge change here.", "James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I thought more volatility actually helps the business. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, it does. If look at the VIX index, just as one indicator, Jim, Q1 and Q2 in round numbers, I'm slightly off in this, but that index was around 20 both Q1 and Q2. So I wouldn't say there was a lot of meaningfully different impact in volatility between the quarter, maybe some slight amounts, but not meaningfully.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the higher-tier band in the U.S. didn't increase as rapidly. Do you think that's a function of the economy or more the competitive environment?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "On DMT, I think it's probably could be a little bit of each. It's hard to tell for certain. That business still had 4% growth. We are going to do some additional marketing there with the domestic business. But it probably could have a little bit economic impact. I'm not sure about the competitive side. And then, any corridor, any market, you do see some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Overall, I would say we're pleased with the business. It's growing. It's a 30% margin business, and we continue to see that as a growth business as we move forward.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And also, I think we are going to implement also some because $5 for $50 and the lower bands are growing very healthy, but it's also going after the higher bands, we may also implement some marketing promotion actions in the future.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then you mentioned some potential ramp marketing spend. Does that change your plans for marketing spend for the year as a whole?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, no, Sara. I think we are actually the same.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "You mentioned some relatively large agent re-signings in the back half of the year. In the past, you've done a good job of driving down commission rates upon re-signing. Is that the trend that we should expect to continue thereby being a little bit of a tailwind for EBIT margin longer term?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think if you look at the last 3, 4 years, we've been driving our cost of sales down. I think from 44% to approximately some-41%. Was that right?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. In 2010, we're around 57%. 2011, round number, 56%. So it's been moving down.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It takes some time, Andrew, until it comes down. But I think, generally, I would say that we are signing new agents globally in a lower commission rate as we did it in the past.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So think about the trends continuing and the effectiveness of your efforts in that direction as well?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. Some years up, and some years down. But you're right, directionally.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, in a given year, there could be some variation. But long term, we believe there's opportunities to continue to optimize the commissions on a long-term basis.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And to be clear, just to make sure I understood you, Scott, in terms of long-term CapEx, '12, sounds like it's going to be above trend line.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, '12, our view is we'll be somewhere around 4% to 5% of our revenues. As we turn the calendar to '13 or on a long-term basis, we think it will be closer to 3%, which is where we run historically. Again, any given year could vary if there's an agent opportunity or some other initiative. But we think the normalized run rate looks closer to 3% long term.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one last one, if I may. On China, you mentioned that there's a little bit of softness there. Would you characterize that as competitive or macro? And do you still have a big ambitions for what could be a pretty significant market opportunity long term?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I think we are very committed to China. And I'd see there's a really long-term market opportunity in China, I mean, given our presence there, given our agents. And I think it has something to do with a little bit macro, and it's a mix of macro. I wouldn't see that as a huge competitive trend. I think we are very well positioned there. So I think I see China as an opportunity.", "Operator", "The last question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Hikmet and Scott, EBIT margin, excluding restructuring and TGBP integration expenses, was down 100 basis points in Q2 versus 200 basis points in Q1. So as you look out to the balance of this year and 2013, can you give us sort of the puts and takes on margins? And I'm more focused on 2013 since you've already commented on 2012. I guess, specifically, what are your thoughts with respect to investment in electronic channels? And then, number two, can you dial back expenses if we remain in a tough global economy, particularly southern Europe?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we are very focused, obviously, on long-term margin expansion. That's clear. Revenue growth will help us to expand the margins. That's for sure. But once we have a strong revenue growth, the margin expansion is here. I would say that we did a significant investment in our San Francisco office, in our digital. These numbers are already showing that we are growing very fast here. We're going to continue to invest, obviously. But I'm not sure it could be higher or lower in the future, the investment in that part. I think I'm, long term, committed to grow this business and long-term margin expansion if -- once we grow this business.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes. And I'll also add, David, as Scott mentioned earlier, we do have Business Solutions synergies coming. We'll have about $30 million of cost savings once we -- that's annualized after 2013. But we'll get a fair amount of those in 2013 as well.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "You spend about $200 million a year in advertising and marketing. Do you anticipate dialing that spend back next year if the economy remains weak?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I think marketing is -- obviously, our brand, our customer relationship, our expansion is very important for us. I think we are positioned. We want to expand. We want to gain market share. I think marketing is one of our tools to gain that.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss 2012 fourth quarter and full year results and the company's outlook for 2013. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, which were largely consistent with the outlook we provided in late October.", "Scott will give you a more detailed review of the results later on the call, but I would like to spend a few minutes recapping 2012 and discussing our priorities for 2013 and beyond.", "Overall, the business delivered a third consecutive year of constant currency revenue growth despite challenges from compliance-related changes affecting Mexico and Latin America, economic softness in Europe and competitive pressures in some parts of Consumer Money Transfer business.", "Our digital and electronic account-based money transfer business grew rapidly, and we continue to see our online channel attract new customers.", "For the year, electronic channel revenue increased 27% and now represents 4% of total company revenue. Although we're seeing in business solutions, revenue growth was not as strong as planned, we made good progress integrating the Travelex acquisition and further expanding our product offerings and geographic reach.", "Some of the great aspects of our business model is generating strong cash flow. In 2012, we continued this trend and cash from operating activities reached approximately $1.2 billion last year. Over the course of 2012, more than $1 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of stock buyback and dividends.", "Moving to 2013, our strategies are focused on 3 key initiatives: Strengthening our Consumer Money Transfer business; driving growth of customers and usage of Western Union Business Solutions; and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders.", "Consumer Money Transfer remains a great business to be in. Remittance market is growing, and we are a market leader with strong assets. As we discussed at the end of last year, we have faced competitive pressures and some regulatory-related changes in some corridors, and we are implementing key actions to address them. We believe we have the right plans in place to regain momentum and we are keenly focused on executing these plans.", "Our planned actions include: improving the consumer value proposition, including pricing investments in key corridor; continue to expand our digital and account-based electronic channels; and further expanding our agent network. We will also continue to upgrade our anti-money laundering and compliance capabilities. We are committed to be the best-in-class programs in these areas, and we are now spending over $100 million a year on these programs.", "For the pricing investments, we expect to invest approximately 5% of total company revenue into pricing in 2013 to address challenges in certain corridors. The majority of this pricing will be in some key markets, and actions will cover corridors representing approximately 25% for our consumer-to-consumer business is on revenues.", "Our brand value commands a premium price in most corridors, and our brand stands for trust, speed, reliability and convenience. We will continue to market our brand, enhance services, deepen customer relationships and expand convenience through more choice. However, we also want to strike the right balance with price to achieve an attractive consumer value proposition in each market, and that is the ultimate goal of the pricing investments.", "Based on our experience with similar actions over the last several years, we believe the pricing investments will result in a declining consumer-to-consumer revenues in 2013 but lead to revenue growth in the following years due to anticipated increases in consumer usage and loyalty.", "In late November and early December, we launched about half of the planned pricing investments, so we have limited reach on the data at this point. However, let me share with you some early good news in some of the corridors.", "For example, we implemented pricing for the Western Union brand from the U.S. to Mexico, and we have seen the expected transaction lift. We're seeing in brand transaction growth for Mexico increase mid-single-digits in December compared to a slight decline in the market according to the Bank of Mexico. This is an early indication that our pricing investments are working. We have also seen respectable increases in transactions in the westernunion.com business, and we have seen nice transaction growth in the France to Africa corridor.", "While early results from some of the U.S. Latin America corridors have not seen as strong yet, they are still in the process of driving awareness in these markets.", "Let me say once again, it is very early in this process with our pricing investments, but so far, so good. Overall, for the portfolio of corridors we are -- we have been taken pricing actions, we are seeing the transaction lift we expected, but many of the actions are yet to be rolled out or fully marketed.", "In addition to improving the consumer value proposition, we also remain focused on further developing electronic channels as we continue to expand our efforts to connect the cash and digital world for our consumers.", "Both westernunion.com and electronic account-based money transfer through banks are growing fast, and we are capitalizing on these fast-growing channels opportunities. We plan to add capabilities, such as direct-to-bank delivery and more mobile access and further our reach to acquire even more consumers.", "Westernunion.com money transfer transactions grew over 40% in 2012, and we believe we will see significantly higher transaction growth in 2013. Revenue exceeded $150 million last year, and we remain on track to meet our $500 million digital goal for 2015.", "Transactions for electronic account-based money transfer through banks increased over 50% in 2012. And we are focused on expanding the service to more banks in 2013, as we believe this electronic channel also represents strong incremental opportunity.", "We plan to continue to increase our agent location network, with a particular focus this year on strategic areas such as rebuilding the Mexico and Russia networks and further expanding in Europe and Asia.", "We are also expanding our alternative distribution channels. Approximately 100,000 ATMs globally have the Western Union Money Transfer capability today. As we take the steps to strengthen our value proposition in key corridors, attract new customers to digital and account-based channel expansion and other initiatives and further grow our network, I am confident we will see a rapid transformation in 2013 and return the Consumer Money Transfer business to growth in 2014 and '15.", "Our second strategic initiatives for 2013 involves driving growth in customers and usage in Western Union Business Solutions. We continue to believe business-to-business payments offer long-term opportunity for Western Union. Global trade is expected to grow at attractive rates over the long term, and Western Union Business Solutions offers strong platforms, services and customized solutions for small businesses and other customers at competitive rates. All the slowdowns in trade and normal integration challenges impacted the Western Union Business Solutions revenue growth in 2012. We made strategic progress that should support our growth in the future.", "We expanded our presence to 30 countries, realigned and refocused our sales organization and incentives and laid the groundwork to increase our product offerings.", "Our B2B sales organization focus will have more specialization on product and customer segments, and sales incentives have been better aligned to drive performance. Product offerings are being expanded, as we will introduce options and forwards products in additional countries, provide specialized payment services for non-profit organizations and focus on developing export-driven models as well.", "We believe new customer acquisition and additional usage will drive stronger revenue growth in Business Solutions as we progress through 2013, and we should see additional benefit and stronger growth over the long term as global trade returns to better levels.", "Finally, the third key initiative we are focused on 2013 is to continue to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders. We anticipate cash flow from operating activities of approximately $900 million in 2013 or approximately $1 billion, excluding IRS agreement, tax payments, and we do not anticipate any significant acquisition activity.", "We expect to return approximately $700 million to shareholders in 2013. This includes approximately $400 million of share repurchases and around $300 million of dividends. Based on recent stock price levels, these actions combined would represent returning approximately 8% of our market capitalization to shareholders.", "To summarize, Western Union Foundation is strong. We have a valued brand, a global network, worldwide operation and expertise and robust cash flow. The balance sheet is healthy, and even in this 2013 transition year, the company should generate over $1 billion of operating income. We are focused on execution in 2013, as we take the steps to reset the business. We believe in our plan and our investment, and I am confident the strategic actions that we are implementing should position us well to drive growth in the future.", "We anticipate a return to revenue and profit growth in 2014, as we benefit from having more customers, better value proposition, additional products and services and further cost efficiencies while participating in growing markets.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results and other 2013 outlook, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2012 financial results, I will primarily focus on the fourth quarter. Similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.", "Overall for the quarter, we reported consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion, which was flat with the year ago quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis.", "Consolidated pro forma constant currency revenue, including a full quarter of Travelex Global Business Payments in the prior year period, decreased 1% and was negatively impacted by 1% by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands.", "Revenue for the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands declined over 50% primarily due to the Mexico location reductions in the third quarter, which resulted from the Southwest Border compliance changes. Vigo and Orlandi Valuta represented about 2% of total company revenue for the full year.", "In the consumer-to-consumer segment, revenue decreased 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, with transactions down 1% compared to the prior year period. Excluding Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, Western Union branded consumer-to-consumer constant currency revenue grew slightly in the quarter on transaction growth of 3%.", "C2C cross-border principal declined 3% in the quarter or 2% on a constant currency basis, an improvement from last quarter's rate. Western Union branded principal increased in the fourth quarter.", "C2C principal per transaction declined 2% year-over-year, which also represented an improvement from the third quarter rate.", "Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 22% of total company revenue, decreased 5% year-over-year. The decline included a negative 2% impact from currency translation. Transactions in the region were flat with the year ago quarter.", "Although much of Europe remains soft, Germany continued to perform well. And overall revenue transaction trends for the region improved relative to the third quarter.", "Turning to North America, revenue declined 9% from the prior year and transactions were down 6%. The region represented 19% of total company revenue. U.S. outbound revenue declined in the quarter, while domestic money transfer revenue was flat on transaction growth of 7%. U.S. outbound revenue was impacted by some of our pricing actions, which, as we mentioned, are meeting our overall expectations.", "Mexico revenue declined 25% and transactions decreased 21% in the quarter. Mexico revenue is being impacted by a full quarter of the compliance-related reduction in Vigo locations and by the pricing investments that were implemented in the quarter for the Western Union brand.", "For the Western Union brand, Mexico revenue declined 8%, while transactions increased 2% for the full quarter. As Hikmet mentioned, transaction results improved to mid-single-digit growth in December, following our pricing actions.", "In total, Mexico represented 4% of total company revenues in the quarter. While Mexico revenue trends will be very challenging until we reach the anniversary of the Vigo location reductions and the pricing actions, we're actively working to expand our agent locations in the country and leverage the Western Union brand.", "Regarding the Southwest Border agreement. The Monitor's term was scheduled to end July 31, and we are continuing to work diligently with the Monitor's recommendation. We have spent over $40 million on Southwest Border compliance activities since we signed the agreement in early 2010 and made major changes to our business model in Mexico. While we have devoted significant time and resources to these efforts, we do not expect to have all of them fully implemented by July 31 due to their extensive and complex nature.", "Western Union Business Solutions was recently added to the scope of the Monitor's review. And in late January, the current Monitor resigned. The new Monitor is in the process of being identified. We're conferring with the State of Arizona about the company's progress and implementing the recommendations and the implications for the agreements. We will update you when we have further information about the status.", "Turning back to the Middle East and Africa region. Revenue in the quarter increased 3% on a reported basis, including a negative 2% impact from currency, while transactions grew 6%. Trends improved compared to the third quarter, as strong outbound business from the Gulf States help drive the growth.", "The Asia-Pacific region was flat in the quarter -- the Asia-Pacific region revenue was flat in the quarter, including a positive 1% impact from currency translation with flat transaction growth.  China revenue increased slightly in the quarter, but this was offset by declines in other large inbound markets. The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue grew 2%, including a negative 2% impact from currency. Transactions declined 5% in the quarter and were negatively impacted by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta compliance-related changes implemented in the third quarter.", "Westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 16% on a reported basis and has no impact from currency. Transaction growth accelerated to 46%, largely driven by the success of promotional and enterprising investments intended to accelerate customer acquisition. As a reminder, westernunion.com results are not included in the growth rates for the other 5 regions, although they are included when we discuss specific country trends.", "Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile increased 22% in the quarter. Electronic channels represented 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year ago period.", "Revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 37%. We now have nearly 115 banks signed for account-based money transfer, with service launched at over half of these banks.", "Prepaid revenue increased 16% in the quarter. The prepaid business, including third-party top-up, represented approximately 1% of company revenue. Prepaid cards were available at approximately 40,000 retail locations globally at the end of the quarter, including approximately 1,500 locations outside the U.S.", "Turning back to the total C2C business. The spread between transaction and revenue declined in the quarter was 1 percentage point, and there was no impact from currency.", "For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, while mix had a positive impact of approximately 1%. For the full year, the pricing impacts was approximately 1% on both C2C and total company revenue.", "Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue decreased 1% in the quarter, including a negative 3% impact from currency translation. South America continues to have steady growth, but this was offset by declines in U.S. walk-in business.", "Business Solutions reported a revenue of $93 million in the quarter, which compared to $68 million  a year ago. On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of Travelex results in the prior year period, Business Solutions constant currency revenue was down 2%.", "Our Business Solutions customer account continues to grow, and we now have a presence in 30 countries compared to 23 a year ago. The transactions are growing in double digits, but  principal per transaction declined, an indication of the soft global trade conditions.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The fourth quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 20.1%, or 20.9% excluding $12 million of Travelex integration expenses, compared to 25.0% in the prior year period and 25.4% excluding $5 million of integration expenses.", "The current quarter includes $31 million of expenses related to new cost-savings initiatives. In addition, the margin was negatively impacted by the higher Business Solutions bank fees and other spending, pricing investments, increased marketing, higher compliance related to the Southwest Border and Dodd-Frank and increased bad debt expenses. EBITDA margin was 25.2% compared to 29.2% a year ago, excluding integration expenses in both periods.", "Other expense net was $41 million in the current quarter compared to $6 million a year ago. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized a gain of $20 million related to the revaluation of the company's previous ownership position from European superagent, Finint, and a gain of $21 million on foreign currency forward contracts related primarily to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments.", "Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.40 compared to $0.73 in the prior year. EPS was $0.42, excluding Travelex integration expenses, which compared to $0.40 in the prior year excluding the $205 million tax benefit related to the IRS agreement. EPS in the current quarter includes $0.03 of expenses related to the cost-savings initiatives.", "The C2C operating segment margin was 25.0% compared to 28.0% from the same period last year. The margin was impacted in the quarter primarily by cost-savings initiatives and expenses, price investments, increased bad debt expenses and higher market.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 17.0% compared to 27.3% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily driven by the impact of the renegotiation of the  third party sales and distribution agreement, which should benefit C2B margins in future quarters, and expenses related to cost-savings initiatives.", "Business solutions reported an operating loss of $18 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $2 million in the year ago period. Last year's operating loss reflected only a partial quarter of Travelex Global Business Payments following the November acquisition.", "The current quarter's $18 million loss included $18 million of depreciation and amortization and $12 million of Travelex integration expenses.", "The depreciation and amortization of last year's fourth quarter was $13 million, while integration expense was $5 million. Bank fees from higher transactions and IT and compliance spending also increased compared to last year.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We once again generated strong cash flow in 2012. Cash flow from operations for the year was approximately $1.2 billion, which includes the impact of $92 million of net tax payments relating to the agreement with the IRS. We have approximately $100 million of remaining tax payments related to this agreement, which we expect to pay in 2013.", "Capital expenditures in the quarter were $85 million and included increases in agent signing bonuses, including some major renewals. For the year, capital spending was just under 5% of company revenue, in line with our outlook.", "Depreciation and amortization expense was $62 million in the quarter. At the end of the year, the company had debt of $4 billion and cash of $1.8 billion. Approximately half of the cash was held by United States entities.", "In the fourth quarter, we issued $750 million of debt, including $500 million of 5-year notes at a coupon of 2 7/8% and $250 million of 3-year notes at a coupon of 2 3/8%. We plan to use a portion of the proceeds to pay out $300 million of notes that mature in March.", "During the fourth quarter, we spent $351 million to repurchase approximately 27 million shares at an average price of $13.12. In addition, we declared $72 million in dividends, which were paid in December.", "As Hikmet mentioned, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2012. We repurchased 51 million shares last year, or just over 8% of total shares outstanding.", "As of year end, we had 572 million shares outstanding and $394 million remaining in our repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013.", "Turning to our expectations for 2013. Our outlook reflects the strategic actions we are implementing this year to drive future revenue growth and enhance long-term profitability. The strategic actions are expected to negatively impact revenue and profitability in 2013 but lead the growth in 2014 and 2015.", "We expect the economic environment of 2013 to be similar to 2012. The outlook includes a pricing investment of approximately 5% of total company revenues, approximately 6% to 7% of C2C revenues in 2013. We expect these pricing investments to improve transaction trends this year, with Western Union branded C2C transactions anticipated to increase mid to high-single-digits in 2013 compared to 4% in 2012.", "Total C2C transaction increases are expected to be about 2 percentage points lower than Western Union brand due to the clients from the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta.", "The transaction growth rate should improve sequentially as we move through the year, as the pricing and other actions take effect. We have only implemented about half of our planned pricing investment so far and are still building awareness of the actions in many markets, so we would expect to see an overall transaction lift for the Western Union brand beginning in the second quarter and then see acceleration as we go through the rest of the year. To increase productivity and fund a portion of our growth base spending, we're implementing additional cost-savings initiatives. Net impact of these cost-saving initiatives is expected to be negative in 2013 due to the upfront costs but beneficial to margins and profits beginning in 2014.", "The outlook includes approximately $45 million of expenses from new cost-savings initiatives this year, which is in addition to the $31 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. These initiatives include expenses such as severance, outplacement and other related benefits, and expenses related to relocation of certain operations to existing company facilities or third-party providers.", "Cost-saving initiatives are expected to generate approximately $30 million of savings in 2013 and approximately $45 million of savings beginning in 2014.", "The 2013 outlook also includes approximately $20 million of expenses for continuing Travelex integration. As a result of all these factors, the outlook for revenue and margins in 2013 is: constant currency revenue down low-single digits, GAAP operating margin of approximately 20% and EBITDA margin of approximately 24.5%. Approximately 2/3 of the GAAP operating margin decline compared to 2012 is attributable to actions being implemented to improve competitive positioning and mix.", "Pricing investments are expected to result in higher variable cost from increased transactions and negative fixed cost leverage from lower revenue in 2013.", "Average commission rates are also expected to increase this year due to mix, some large agent renewals and other factors.", "The other 1/3 of the margin decline is primarily due to a combination of growth investments and increased compliance and regulatory cost. The other growth investments include additional investments in digital and prepaid and the development of new products. These investments are largely infrastructure-related and are expected to be ongoing cost of the business for future years.", "Net expenses for TGBP integration and cost-savings initiatives are expected to be lower in 2013 than prior year. This is being offset by changes in incentive compensation, which was at reduced levels in 2012.", "The 2013 operating margin includes approximately $65 million of expenses, which should not reoccur in 2014.

We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 15% in 2013, which is higher than last year due to benefits and favorable settlements in 2012.", "In 2012, we provided both GAAP EPS and EPS excluding TGBP integration expense. For 2013, we are only providing GAAP EPS.", "GAAP earnings per share outlook for 2013 is a range of $1.33 to $1.43, including an approximately $0.03 per share impact from Travelex integration expenses.", "In 2013, earnings per share outlook also reflects an approximately $0.06 per share impact from expenses related to the new cost-savings initiatives.", "Compared to 2012, the EPS range includes an increase in other expense net of approximately $0.04 per share primarily due to higher net interest expense from incremental long-term debt at higher average rates and other miscellaneous changes.", "Cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $900 million or $1 billion excluding final tax payments of approximately $100 million related to the IRS agreement, which we expect to pay in 2013.", "Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4% to 5% of revenues in 2013, although we anticipate they will average closer to 3% over the next few years.", "As Hikmet mentioned, we expect to return approximately $700 million to shareholders in 2013 through repurchases and dividends, including approximately $400 million of share repurchases.", "We will remain committed to consistently generating and deploying strong cash flows for our shareholders while also maintaining an investment grade credit rating.

Operator, we're now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair.", "Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "On your pricing investments that you've made this year, your -- if you -- your pricing gap, I think, versus competitor's has narrowed or is narrowing but is still relatively wide. How confident are you that you won't need abnormal levels of pricing investments beyond what you've announced so far?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Bob, thank you for the question. If you look at our business, we are pretty confident that the existing pricing action will work. We've done many pricing actions in the past. I've personally done about more than 100 pricing actions -- hundreds of pricing actions in my career. And typically, they come back after 12 to 18 months also to our revenue growth. The pricing actions we implement during the early signings, it's really too early. We started mid-November, beginning of December. But as I mentioned before, the U.S. to Mexico pricing is working so far so good pretty well. We see the price indications in December. Bank of Mexico data shows that there's a decline on principal, but we have a mid-single-digit growth, right, Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "In Mexico.", "Hikmet Ersek", "In Mexico, that corridor, so we are beating the market's earlier indications. We've been -- being in so many corridors, we adapt pricing actions to the customer needs. But we are pretty confident that we are turning back in 2014 to 1% to 3% our usual pricing investment. And so the first indications are so far, so good.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. On your westernunion.com business, I mean, obviously, great transaction growth, 46%. Revenue growth at 16%. First, what percentage of that business is card-based, credit or debit versus ACH?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, first of  -- we don't -- I don't think we give the numbers here, which percentage is credit cards and ACH. But many is used by the cards. And are -- we are very [indiscernible] despite the growth rates here. We are getting new customers. Just a reminder, 80% of the customers are new to our brand, new to the westernunion.com. Never used Western Union, but new to Western Union data they are using. And we grew 46% on transactions. So that's the current environment, the number that's expected in westernunion.com.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Last question just related to that. Are there additional pricing investments in the westernunion.com sector to come?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Bob, this is Scott. I don't want to get ahead of myself as far as what pricing we might be doing in certain markets for competitive reasons. But we feel like we're well positioned in westernunion.com, 80% of the customers are new. And to circle back on your one question, just to add -- to color what Hikmet said that as far as the funding methods, it's primarily credit cards for us today. But that's where we see an opportunity as we think about growing this business to provide our customers with different funding sources and payout sources, not only leveraging our 500,000 location network that being able to drop money in the bank accounts, but allowing customers to pay through ACH and other ways. So that's one of the things that allow us to get to that $500 million business by 2015.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask about -- I know there's a lot of detail shared here. Just -- I'm curious, the loss of Vigo and the OV business, were you able to recapture that with your pricing initiatives? What's -- what are you -- most of the intelligence telling you in terms of recapture of share?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, we are basically growing on the Western Union brand business. We did not capture that on Vigo and Orlandi Valuta. We still have location loss last quarter. As you know, Tien-Tsin, about 7,000 locations in Mexico. We are very focused to expand our location network in Mexico. But the pricing actions that we did is -- was on the Western Union branded transfers, and that's working pretty well. The loss of Vigo and Orlandi Valuta is still here, and it's the majority of why the corridor is losing on the performance. But I'm very pleased with the Western Union branded price actions.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, good to know. And just on the -- I'm curious, just with all the price cuts, it sounds like you still have a little bit more to do, and we'll learn more about that. But what's been the agent response to the price cuts? And I'm curious of the higher commission comment is tied in any way to the pricing investments that you're talking about or if that's separate?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think that's 2 separate things, Tien-Tsin. The agent response were quite positive because our brand attracts traffic to the retail network. And agents were very pleased that they can gain. Again, our ultimate goal is to grow, and it brings traffic in 2013. And they are pretty pleased on that. I did not see any agent negative reaction from market or from somewhere, I didn't hear it so far. Regarding on the agent commission. As you know, that we have the agent's commission -- agent agreements for 5 to 7 years in average. And over the few years, it has been declining. '13, we have a little bit higher commission rates, Scott, right? But generally, our goal is, as you know, bringing down the commission rates and have been situation. I don't see as an early signing that it's a competitive issue or pricing issue. I see that as agent renewal timing issue.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, so it's just timing. Very good, that's good to know. Last one and I'll jump off. Just the -- you've returned a lot of capital to shareholders, obviously. But I guess the implication for '13 is a stepdown in buybacks. Is that just a -- again, is that a timing issue or a little bit of a pause, or could that actually step up as the year progresses?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Tien-Tsin, this is Scott. We generate strong cash flows historically, $1 billion plus for sure and, historically, have been very committed to getting cash back to our shareholders. Just in 2012, between dividends and buyback, over $1 billion. In fact, in the fourth quarter, $350 million of buybacks. So we're committed, between dividends and buyback in 2013, to return $700 million. We want to continue to target an investment grade credit rating as we move forward. And Hikmet and I continually have dialogue with each other and with the Board discussing our cash flows and how to best to deploy those for our shareholders as we move forward. But our track record has been strong, and I think $700 million is a strong step forward right now.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is David Chu for Sara Gubins. What percentage of your agent base is WU branded versus non WU branded?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "David, a majority of the agent base is WU branded, if you will. The revenue that we called out for the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta is about 2% of our revenues. So the rest of the network is really, it's a Western Union network primarily.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. And as you know, Vigo and Orlandi Valuta is mostly Mexican, Latin America.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And is there -- can you share kind of your expectations for B2B in 2013?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, David. In simple terms, we expect the revenue growth rate and profitability to improve in 2013 compared to 2012. And a couple of things have been really driving that. And first I would say is that we're in a market that's growing. The global market for trade, if you will, is probably growing anywhere from the mid-single-digits to the high-single-digits, depending upon the period. And then the team in London around the globe is very focused on driving increased sales effectiveness, so we're getting very customer-focused there. We're going to expand to more countries. A year ago, we're in 23 countries. Today, we're in 30. When we have this discussion a year from now, we're going to be in more countries. And then we also have an opportunity to diversify our product offering. An example I would give you is we have option products, forward products, but not in all countries. We have opportunities to move those products into other countries. So the simple answer coming back to it is we expect to see revenue growth and profitability improve in '13 compared to where we were in 2012. On a long-term basis, we expect our top line to grow that business in the low-double-digits from a revenue standpoint.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question first on the corridors that you've actually addressed. I know you can't specifically mention all the ones by name, but just give us a sense maybe how many you've done or how many you still have to do as part of this pricing initiative this year? Can you just tell us maybe percentage-wise how many actual corridors have more to go? And then just a follow-up on pricing.", "Hikmet Ersek", "So corridor-wise, we won't disclose it. But there's 25% -- we plan about 25% of our revenue -- of our business putting some pricing actions. Some are related to the compliance issues, like in -- some regulatory compliance issue and U.S. to Mexico. But some of them like U.S., the Europe to Africa, and especially France to Africa. It's working pretty well. We did some in westernunion.com, the transactions growth lifted very well, and the -- we have a good traction there. And also, we are planning some U.S. to Latin America. It's in early stages. We started quite late. We do some marketing programs behind that. But please understand that for competitive reasons, I don't want to give more corridor-specific...", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's fine, I understand. Just a quick follow-up to that, though. I mean a couple of years ago, it sound -- I remember you changed domestic pricing, and the result is very solid. You had great transaction growth pretty immediately. I think it lasted about 1.5 year, where transactions were well above what you'd even -- 20%-ish type range, and then it came down and moderated. And it seems like it's now slowing to -- I mean, you tell me, I think it was down to low-single-digit. I don't remember what you said exactly before, but it's down again. And is that because of just some of the pricing changes you're doing now that go sort of touch on the domestic corridor again and that's having an impact on revenue and transactions now? Or can you help us understand why it wasn't more sustainable, I guess?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I'm very pleased with the DMT -- U.S. DMT transaction growth. It's 7%.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. During the last 3 quarters, it's grown 7% and 8% for the year. So we've got strong, I'll call it high-single-digit transaction growth. Yes, and what you're seeing is some mix where we're seeing more growth in the lower bands, call it 0 to 50. Not quite as much growth in the higher bands. But as you think about what we've done to domestic money transfer compared to having maybe not done anything, now we're seeing more transactions, more customers in the franchise. So as we think about evolving our brand and evolving our product offerings, we've got more touch points with customers. So I still -- we're still very pleased with the success of the domestic money transfer repositioning and pricing that we've done.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. And 2 years ago, it was really going down.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "But one last question on the dot-com channel. With regard to ACH, I think that came up before. I mean that's definitely one other alternative for help -- to help you price efficiently going forward. How far off do you think you are from getting that capability in terms of more real-time and authorization to go or some of your competition going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It depends really on the countries. We are very far on the ACH in many countries, especially in the European countries to getting money from your account. It's very common and direct in real-time. And it has definitely better interchange fees with -- than the credit cards. But most of them are still credit card transactions. And the team is very -- it's going very fast, the ACH, and the direct debit is going pretty good. So I believe that will, long term, also help our profitability on the westernunion.com.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Tom McCrohan of Janney.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "What was the transaction growth this quarter adjusted for the situation in Mexico?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Are you looking for the total C2C transaction growth or just for Mexico itself?", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "C2C. Total C2C.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "All right. Total C2C, it was up 3% transaction growth.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And how many of your customers for the C2C segment have a bank account?", "Hikmet Ersek", "About 70%.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Of our senders.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Senders and...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And the majority have a bank account.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Majority of the bank account.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "7-0?", "Hikmet Ersek", "7-0, yes.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "7-0, got it. And how does your pricing in that account-to-account corridor or segment compare to your competition with these pricing actions? Are you now in line or below? Just give us some sense.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It depends really on the corridors. It depends really -- I think they are too much gaining market share there. Just a reminder, our -- westernunion.com is growing 46%. Our account-to-account is growing 50%. And 80% of the customers are new. So we don't give specific corridor numbers, but I'm very pleased with the account-to-account transactions. You signed 115 banks and deactivated, out of the 115 banks, 60 of them and the transaction growth is about 50%.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And, Tom, as you know, most of our business is really cash-to-cash or online-to-cash. So we're just really getting started on delivering 2 bank accounts, so not much of our business today actually goes to accounts.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, additional reports from [indiscernible].", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And so even the bank relationships that you've been growing, is that account-to-cash for the most part?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Most of that, yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Primarily, yes.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Account-based money transfer, which is primarily account-to-cash...", "Hikmet Ersek", "That it come to retail.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. As Hikmet and Mike mentioned, I think dropping funds into an account is an opportunity for us, for sure.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Great. And my last question is just on the regulatory side, with this pushout, I guess, in the deadline for Rule 1073. What -- do you have any insight into how that's going to impact Western Union? And it seems like the banks will have more of a problem complying with these new rules. I just wanted to confirm that with you in how do you -- do you view that new rule as an advantage or a disadvantage for you folks going forward?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, I want to make sure you're referring to Dodd-Frank, is what you're referring to?", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, yes. It's hard for me to speak for the banks, but I can speak for what we're doing at Western Union. And we're doing all the things that we need to be ready for that. The initial date was going to be early February, then the regulatory authorities have pushed that out. So probably at the earliest will be mid-summer right now, and the regulatory authorities are still working for that. But we've been working diligently on that and feel like when the time comes, we will be well prepared and our agents will be well prepared.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just want to ask, it looks like the pricing actions have kind of gone to your expectations. And I know it's early, but as we go into '13, obviously you'll implement more. But I guess how confident are you that you return to revenue growth and profit growth in '14 and '15? And maybe you can just give us why you're confident on that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. Bryan, I am pretty confident because we did many pricing actions. And every pricing action, every big investment, of course, in the beginning has a question. But based on my experience, based on the company experience, it takes about 12 to 18 months depending when you start with the pricing. And the pricings we start, I'm confident that in '14, you will see positive impact here on the revenue impact. And so we are targeting 25%. And, Bryan, as you remember, DMT pricing investment, which we did about 2 years ago, in the beginning it has a transaction growth, high-transaction growth. And after about 12 to 18 months, the revenue came also. And we were very pleased and turned around this business. So based on all the experiences, I believe it will be successful.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And, Bryan, the only thing I would add to what Hikmet said is pricing is one lever that we're looking at to grow the business in '14 and '15. But we're rapidly expanding westernunion.com. We're doing some really good things with account-based money transfer. We feel like we're on track to grow B2B faster in '13 than we did in '12. We expect some growth out of the C2B business. So I think all those things combined give us confidence that in '14 and '15, we can grow revenues and profits.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then thinking about pricing as we look out, it sounds like we're likely to go back to the typical 1% to 3% decline cycle that we were in previously. I guess, what gives you confidence that there's nothing in the compliance or something that -- things here that you don't know about? Or I mean I guess one of the ways to think about it, I guess, is there's probably -- is there anything out there that could be as large as the situation that happened with Vigo and Orlandi Valuta that could have that kind of an impact on price?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, from today's point of view, I really believe that we're going to come to 1% to 2% pricing environment. The regulatory environment is challenging. It's -- obviously, they are very [indiscernible]-regulated market. But all our investments, about $100 million a year that we invested to anti-money laundering compliance, are really putting us a industry standard. Being a market leader puts us in an industry standard, and we want to be a best-in-class and see that as a long-term competitive advantage. I think regulators are looking also on us, and we do have a duty to satisfy customer needs and we are working very hard on that.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly for me, just 2 macro questions. I know pre the Great Recession, WU quoted that the construction vertical was about 20% to 25% of revenue. I'm just curious what that number is now in 2012, after this year. And then secondly, immigration reform, a lot of talk about that in DC. Can you give us some thoughts on if you think that would be a positive or a negative for Western Union?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Bryan. This is Scott. On the construction, what I would tell you just broadly is that if you think around the globe, our customers come from -- working on 100 different areas. So whether it's in nursing, the service industry, retail, construction, so I would say we continue to be diversified around the globe. I don't have a specific number to give to you on construction. On immigration, in general, what we'd say is that we're not just pushing for one side or the other. But for immigration reform, we think it would be good just so that everybody understands what are the rules, what are the regulations. So overall, we support immigration reform...", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think it's -- Bryan, I think it will have a positive impact. I think -- the support immigration reform, I think the people who are immigrated to the U.S. do have relatives, loved ones, and they would like to use a service like Western Union, I believe.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask a little bit more about kind of post 2013. And I realized it's really too early to be precise in some answers there. But it feels to me like probably one of the biggest issues for investors is what is the post 2013 earnings power of the company? I mean do you think, is it realistic at some point in time beyond this year for EBIT margins to get back to the mid-20s in a decent macro environment, or are we kind of going to be stuck down more in the lower 20s just given what the pricing environment looks like?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Scott, just jump in. But generally, what I would say that our business model is attractive too and is built to grow the top line. Every top line growth will help to increase our margins. And so we are -- we will set up in 2013 to bring higher growth, top line growth and profit growth. Scott, any...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, there's a couple of things I would add, Jason, to build on Hikmet's point. The most important thing for us for profitability is driving the top line revenue. That is really key. And if you think about our business model, 65% of our costs are variable, about 35% are fixed. And then [indiscernible] that the broadview I put this around is that we're not providing any specific outlook for '14 and '15. It's just too early. But if you think about our business, our C2C cross-border business, we're in a healthy industry where the industry is growing principal in the mid-single-digits. And our long-term goal is we want to not only grow that rate but gain more than our fair share of growth there as we move forward. Also, the B2B business, it's in a market that's growing probably mid to high-single-digits, depending upon the period you look at with what we trade. And then finally, as you think about margins, and this is my -- probably more particular to 2014, is that there is about $65 million of cost that we're going to incur in 2013 that we don't expect to occur -- reoccur in 2014. And specifically, Jason, that's $45 million for the cost-savings initiatives that we're taking on in '13 that we won't have that expense in '14. And then there's about $20 million of Travelex integration that we're incurring in '13 that we won't incur in '14. And then the last thing I would add to that is as we think about these cost-savings initiatives, we believe that will drive about $30 million of savings this year. That'll ramp up to be about $45 million in '14. So we can get a little bit better on the cost savings. But back to the headline or the punchline. What's most important for us for margins and profitability is we want to optimize revenue growth, optimize profit growth. But the goal for us is to really drive that top line, we should be helpful to profit [indiscernible].", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, yes, that's a good color. And just to ask a follow-up on the electronic channels. I guess, we would estimate that in 2012, electronic channels in total was maybe about $200 million in revenue. And I know you guys are standing by your target of $500 million in 2015. I guess I mean do you need to grow this base about 35% or so CAGR over the next 3 years to get there? Is that achievable organically without any acquisitions?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, we think it's achievable. And, Jason, let me just throw a little bit color on your numbers just to make sure we're clear. The westernunion.com business that we believe can be a $500 million business in 2015 has about $150 million business today. So the 35% math is probably closer on round numbers to about 50%. But the punchline is that we think that, that is very achievable. And some of the reasons I would give you is we're going to expand to additional countries. We also have opportunity to give our customers more choice and convenience as far as how do they pay for that money transfer, but also how do their loved one pick up their money transfer. And we think there's additional opportunities to leverage not only the best of our cash network of the 500,000 locations but be able to drop money in the bank accounts and other things. So you saw a 46% transaction growth in the fourth quarter, and we believe that, that business will grow faster than the 40% overall rate that we had in '12 and 2013.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I mean, the short answer is yes. It is achievable. And our operating plan, incentives, everything is built on that.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. We just need to see, I guess, that gap narrow a bit obviously between the transaction growth and the revenue growth in that channel.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Absolutely, yes.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's actually Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. Scott, I was just wondering if you can help us with the timing of the $65 million of one-time expenses throughout 2013, and what segments those will be focused on?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. Phil, primarily they'll be in the first 3 quarters of the year. So primarily in the first 3 quarters of the year. Clearly, the $20 million will be all in the B2B segment for integration, then the remaining $45 million will probably fall a little heavier to the C2C business. So that's about 80% of our business, and then lesser extent, to the C2B segment and the other segments.", "Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one other question on the C2B business. You talked about some investment that occurred in the fourth quarter that impacted the margins. I was just wondering if you can provide some more color around that and what the impact on 2013 will be.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, absolutely. We think that we had an opportunity to renegotiate a sales and distribution agreement that cost us some money in the fourth quarter. But we believe that, that will have benefits in '13 and '14 for sure by saving some distribution costs that we will no longer have to incur. As we think about the C2B business, it has probably a business that will have to in front of the margin on a go-forward basis and then probably have some revenue growth on a go-forward basis, too.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Williams of UBS.", "John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just had 2. I don't want to harp on the westernunion.com thing. But you did talk a little bit about the delta between transaction and revenue growth. I just wanted to get some help from you on the margin structure of those transactions. Seems like they should be meaningfully higher given the lack of a send-side commission. But it seems like you might also have pricing impacting that and making it less of a factor. Could you just give a little bit detail on that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think it's really a profitable model. But in the -- don't forget, as I mentioned before, the majority of the transactions are credit card transaction. It has the interchange cost fee, so it does impact. As we move more to ACH direct to bank and direct debit, the interchange fee should be more profitable. Long term, we believe that we have the savings on the send-side commissions. On the receive side, it depends on if you drop it to a bank account or if you pay it out in a retail money transfer as a cash, it differentiates from the commission side.", "John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I know in the past when we've talked, you said that the margin profile is similar to the rest of the transactions that you typically see. Is that safe to say or are they somewhat higher still even after the interchange is taken into account?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "John, let me put it in terms of this that today, the dot-com business, even though we don't have a send-side commission, we are heavier in the credit cards and we're transitioning that model. But on a long-term basis, we do see the margins being, I'll say, closer to the company average on a long-term basis. Today, because we're making some investments and we've got to do some things to scale a little bit there, the margins are somewhat lower than the company average. But we believe we can get to the company average as we get into 2015. It is a profitable business today.", "John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, so they're currently lower than your typical transactions is what you're saying?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, because of the investments, because of the credit card fees, they are lower than current margins.", "John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Just one other question, just in capital allocation. Obviously, the business has a pretty consistent cash flow profile. The one question we constantly get from investors is just what's keeping you from taking a bigger step here and taking advantage of the dislocation in the share price and maybe doing a bigger buyback or something that's going be more weighty than executing against the current authorization?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "John, thanks for the question because we get that question at times, too. But we have been active in deploying the capital. Again, we -- to your point, we generated billion dollars of cash flow. It's very strong, it's very consistent. We did deploy $350 million just in the fourth quarter to buy back our stock. We plan to deploy about another $400 million in 2013 to buy back our stock. And then Hikmet and I continue to have discussions with our Board, with each other. We'll take into consideration our cash flows. We do want to maintain an investment grade credit rating, because that's important from a business standpoint. But we'll continue to have that dialogue with our Board and ourselves as move forward.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Also just as a reminder, a big part of our cash is growth. So that has also impact on our cash flow.", "Before we close, I just want to thank you for attending this call. As I mentioned before and as Scott mentioned before, we expect that 2013 is really a transition year. We do reset the pricing actions in key corridors. We invest incrementally on the infrastructure to drive really the future growth. We believe that '13 is a transformation year, but we are confident that we have the plan, we have the strategic actions that 2014 and '15 will be future growth year. And I'm confident that we can execute against that. So thank you again attending this call, and we will talk to you soon.", "Operator", "The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's first quarter results and then take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2012 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.", "All statements made by the Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Our first quarter results are largely consistent with our expectations and have provided signs that we are making progress against our key strategies. As we outlined last quarter, we expect 2013 to be a transitional year as we make pricing adjustment and other investment to enhance our competitive position and drive future growth.", "We are focused on 3 main strategies in 2013: strengthening our Consumer Money Transfer business; driving growth in customers and usage in business-to-business; and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. So far, results are in line with the expected impact of the initiatives, although we are also being impacted by some compliance and regulatory-related actions in various parts of the world.", "In Consumer Money Transfer, our experience shows that price reductions lead to revenue declines in the initial 12 months and revenue increases thereafter. Early transaction results indicate our strategic pricing actions are working as planned, and we feel positive about the results.", "For example, in November of last year, we implemented the U.S. to Mexico pricing change. Banco de Mexico recently reported there is a softening in the Mexico remittance market in early 2013. However, our Western Union brand transaction growth has accelerated from a 2% increase in the fourth quarter of last year to 9% in the first quarter.", "We are also seeing very good results on our Africa inbound pricing actions and recently started to see improvement from Latin American and Caribbean pricing as awareness is beginning to spread.", "The westernunion.com online pricing actions are yielding very strong results, and overall, westernunion.com Money Transfer transaction growth accelerated from 46% in the fourth quarter of last year to 60% in the first quarter.", "As of end of the quarter, we had initiated about 75% of the planned pricing investment for the year, and overall, we are meeting our transaction objectives. Entering the first quarter, we had completed about 50% of the planned pricing investment. In the quarter, transaction in these priced corridors increased in the low teens. Excluding the digital pricing actions, transactions in this quarter increased in the mid-single digit, up from flattish prior to the pricings.", "So just to state again, our pricing actions are working as planned so far. Our overall Consumer-to-Consumer transaction growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by the Vigo location closing last year, softness in some markets and other compliance-related actions.", "I should note that in addition to the Southwest Border, we have been implementing compliance and fraud prevention enhancements in various other countries, and we are continuing to expand them. These actions have impacted our results, but we are committed to best-in-class programs and we believe, over the long term, enhancements in these areas will be beneficial for our business and customers. Aside from pricing and compliance actions, we made progress in many other activities designed to strengthen Consumer Money Transfer. We are expecting our -- we are expanding our global network.", "As the regional leadership teams around the world are now reporting directly to me, we have further increased our emphasis on aggressively adding new points of presence. I just visited Mexico last week and saw that we are starting to gain traction, rebuilding our agent network there.", "We recently signed several new agents, including financial institutions such as Bancoppel and Banorte, as well as nonfinancial national retailers. Combined, these signings will give us over 10,000 additional agent locations in Mexico once they're fully implemented, which means doubling our network in the country. We also recently signed Carrefour, a major retail chain in Argentina for both money transfer and bill payments, and we also will soon be adding Alexandria Bank in Egypt, which nearly triple our location network in this country. In addition, in the U.S., we completed multiyear renewal agreements with Safeway, adding bill payments and money orders to our existing money transfer service and with Pay-O-Matic also.", "We are seeing money transfer services are now available for bank customers at over 103,000 ATMs, and we continue to add access through mobile phones. We now have 19 active mobile phone partners. And mobile apps access to westernunion.com is available in the U.S. and Australia. We continue to explore new ways to leverage our network and assets to provide more services.", "For example, I recently visited Haiti, where we are adding a new type of service allowing government social payments to be distributed to Haitian parents, students and senior citizens through Western Union agent locations across the country. And we are further expanding capabilities at our electronic channels, which had 18% revenue growth in the quarter.", "westernunion.com is acquiring customers at a fast rate, as evidenced by 60% increase in money transfer transactions in the quarter. Even our U.S. originated online transactions increased over 70%. We are consistently seeing over 80% of first-time online customers being new to Western Union, meaning new online customers in the past 12 months had not used our brand in the prior 12 months. This gives us confidence that our online channel is not significantly impacting our traditional retail business. Many capabilities are being rolled out, which should further aid our online growth, including new platforms, new mobile apps, direct-to-bank payouts, more funding options, new countries and more robust risk management tools. These features help drive customer acquisition and conversion, and we expect westernunion.com transaction and revenue growth rates to accelerate as we move forward.", "Our electronic account-based Money Transfer transaction through banks increased 45% in the quarter. We now have almost 70 banks active with the service, including most recently, Bank of Montreal in Canada.", "Overall, we expect Consumer Money Transfer trends to improve each quarter throughout the rest of the year. This growth should be driven by completion of our pricing actions, increased traction from the actions, added capabilities in online and agent location expansion. We continue to expect our Western Union brand C2C transaction to increase mid- to high-single digits for the full year with good momentum in the second half.", "Our second key strategic initiative for 2013 is to drive growth in customers and usage in business-to-business. I am pleased to report that Western Union Business Solutions revenue increased 7% in the first quarter. Although global trade growth is still restrained, our business improved as we benefited from enhanced go-to-market processes. The quarter's growth was driven by incremental hedging activity from customers and the addition of the French Travelex business, which we completed in the second quarter of last year.", "While Travelex integration continues, we now have a strong business team in place focused on driving new sales and retention. We continue to introduce new products and services, such as a new cash management dashboard tool for SMEs, new NGO and university-focused services and currency options in the U.K. And we plan to add new markets this year as well. There are still many actions to be executed in Business Solutions and quarterly results may vary, but we feel we have started to gain some momentum with our teams and sales processes and still believe this is a great long-term opportunity for Western Union.", "Our third strategic initiative for 2013 is to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders, a key part of our commitment to deliver increased shareholder value over the long term. In the first quarter we generated $237 million of cash flow from operating activities and returned $260 million to shareholders. This consisted of $100 million -- $190 million of share repurchases and $70 million of dividends. We expect to generate $900 million of operating cash flow for the year, with $700 million returned to shareholders. This represents returning to shareholders over 8% of the current market capitalization.", "Overall, we are on track to meet the full year financial outlook we provided in February. We expected the first half of the year to be challenging due to impact of the pricing actions and other investments and initiatives. As these actions take hold, we are beginning to see positive trends develop, and we believe transaction and revenue growth rates will improve as we move through 2013.", "In the second quarter, we will complete our planned pricing investment and continue to market our actions. We will also execute against our many growth drivers in online money transfer at strategic agent location and implement the Business Solutions strategies to add customers and usage.", "Since we are uniquely positioned to be in 200 countries, we have a view of the mix indicators of the global economy and global regulatory environment. This makes me believe the 2013 environment will be challenging, like last year, but I remain confident that the actions we are taking will lead to return to revenue and profit growth in 2014. We believe we will exit 2013 with strong momentum, and we look forward to reporting on our progress throughout the rest of the year.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, our strategic actions are tracking to our overall objectives, and we have affirmed our full year financial outlook for 2013.", "In the first quarter, we reported total consolidated revenue of $1.3 billion, which was down 5% compared with the year-ago quarter or 4% on a constant currency basis. As expected, the revenue decline was driven by the C2C segment as a result of the price reduction in compliance-related changes.", "Business Solutions delivered a solid quarter with 7% revenue growth. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue decreased 7%, primarily due to the price reductions. The C2C revenue decline also included negative 1% impact from currency and a negative 2% impact from the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, which are still being impacted by the compliance-related changes from last year. We will face negative comparisons for Vigo and Orlandi Valuta until we anniversary those actions in the middle of the third quarter.", "Western Union branded transactions increased 2% in the quarter, although overall transactions declined 2%. Year-over-year comparisons in the quarter were challenging as we had relatively strong transaction growth of 7% in the first quarter a year ago.", "As Hikmet mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the pricing actions. Total transactions in the corridors where we initiated price reductions prior to the beginning of the first quarter increased in the low teens in the quarter. Excluding digital, transaction in these corridors increased in the mid-single digits, and we expect trends to accelerate as we build awareness. In the first quarter, the transaction growth benefit from the price reductions was partially offset by the impact of compliance-related actions and some general softness in certain markets.", "In addition to the Southwest Border change that's affecting Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, we continue to invest in and enhance our anti-money laundering compliance and fraud prevention practices in the U.S. and other markets around the world. These actions include enhanced procedures around areas such as real-time risk assessment, customer callback and verification programs and other fraud prevention activities.", "Overall, C2C cross-border principal declined 3% in the quarter with no impact from currency, while Western Union branded cross-border principal increased 1%. Total principal per transaction declined 1%.", "Global agent locations increased to 515,000 as of the end of the quarter. Increasing the expansion of our points of presence going forward is an important part of our strategy to provide more choice and convenience to our consumers.", "The spread between C2C transaction and revenue declines in the quarter was 5 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 6% in the quarter, while mix had a positive impact of approximately 2%.", "Turning to the regions. C2C revenue in the Europe and CIS region, which represented 21% of total company revenue, decreased 6% year-over-year with no impact from currency. Transactions in the region were down 1% compared with the year-ago quarter. Germany continues to grow, and pricing actions from Europe to Africa are working well. But Southern Europe and Russia remain challenged, and business was also impacted by some compliance-related actions in the U.K. and Spain.", "North America revenue declined 15% from the prior year, while transactions were down 7%. The region represented 19% of total company revenue. The transaction decline in North America is primarily driven by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, where revenue was also impacted by price reductions and declines in higher principal sends in U.S. domestic money transfer. Domestic money transfer revenue was down 2% on transaction growth of 5% in the quarter. Although we continue to see growth in the low principal bands of domestic money transfer, from a revenue perspective, this is offset by declines in high principal bands.", "Mexico revenue declined 32% and transactions decreased 16% in the quarter, as expected. The revenue decline was driven by the compliance-related reduction in Vigo and Orlandi Valuta locations last year and by pricing investments. For the Western Union brand, Mexico revenue declined 20%, while transactions increased 9% in the first quarter. The Western Union brand is growing faster than the market, which declined slightly in the first 2 months of the year according to Banco de Mexico data, and our pricing actions are providing the lift in transactions we expected.", "Revenue in the Middle East and Africa region was flat compared to the year-ago quarter with no impact from currency, while transactions grew 4%.", "Asia Pacific region revenue was down 5% in the quarter with no impact from currency translation on flat transactions.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue declined 7%, including a negative 3% impact from currency. Transactions declined 10% in the quarter. Trends in the region were negatively impacted primarily by Vigo declines and further limitations we placed on our business in Argentina to manage currency exposure.", "westernunion.com C2C revenue increased 13% on a reported basis with no impact from currency. Transaction growth accelerated significantly to 60% as customer acquisition continues to be driven by new capabilities and marketing, customer conversion improvements and pricing investments to enhance the value proposition. Total electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based Money Transfer through banks and mobile, increased 18% in the quarter. Electronic channels represented 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year-ago period.", "In addition to the strong growth from westernunion.com, transactions from account-based Money Transfer through banks increased 45%. Prepaid revenue, including third-party reload, was flat in the quarter. Our prepaid cards were available at approximately 44,000 retail locations globally at the end of the quarter, including approximately 2,500 locations outside the U.S. And we continue to explore new avenues and partnership models to introduce our cards around the world.", "Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Transaction trends were similar to the fourth quarter. Revenue declined 1% in the quarter, including a negative 4% impact from currency translation. Continued growth from South America and the U.S. electronic business was offset by declines in the U.S. cash walk-in business and some lower pricings as a result of pass-throughs to customers of Durbin-related savings.", "Business Solutions revenue increased 7% compared to the first quarter a year ago with no impact from currency translation. Business Solution services are now available in 31 countries, with China being the most recent addition.", "Turning to the consolidated margins. The first quarter consolidated GAAP operating margin was 22.4% compared to 23.9% in the prior year period. Compared to last year's first quarter, the margin was negatively impacted, as expected, by the pricing-driven revenue declines, as well as increased compliance costs and strategic investments, primarily in Digital. These impacts were partially offset by improvements in Business Solutions profitability. We continue to expect the full year operating margin to be approximately 20%, which is lower than the first quarter due to the timing of expenses around cost-savings initiatives and other investments.", "There were approximately $4 million in expenses related to cost-savings initiatives in the quarter, while the full year projection remains around $45 million. EBITDA margin was 27.1% compared to 28.4% a year ago. Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.40 from the prior year.", "The C2C operating segment margin was 25.4% compared to 27.7% in the same period last year. The margin was impacted in the quarter primarily by pricing-driven revenue declines, digital and other strategic investments and increased compliance costs.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 24.7% compared to 26.5% in the prior year period. The margin was negatively impacted by Durbin pass-throughs and mix compared to the year-ago quarter. Business Solutions operating loss improved to $6 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $15 million in the year-ago period. The current quarter was positively impacted by revenue growth, cost synergies and lower Travelex integration expense.", "The first quarter $6 million loss includes $15 million of depreciation and amortization and $4 million of Travelex integration expense. Depreciation and amortization in last year's first quarter was $15 million, while integration expense was $6 million.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, while capital expenditures were $38 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 40% of the cash was held by United States entities. As a reminder, we have approximately $100 million of remaining tax payments related to the IRS agreement announced in late 2011, which we expect to pay in the second half of 2013.", "During the first quarter, we repurchased 13 million shares at an average price of $14.30, totaling $190 million. In addition, we paid $70 million of dividends. In March, we also paid off $300 million of floating rate notes when they matured. As of quarter end, we have 559 million shares outstanding and $200 million remaining under the repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013. As a reminder, we expect to generate approximately $900 million of cash flow from operations this year or approximately $1 million excluding the IRS agreement payments.", "Turning to our expectations for the full year. We are affirming our outlook that we provided in February. As we stated, we expect 2013 to be a transitional year as we implement our strategic actions, and we are making progress. We continue to expect transaction revenue growth to improve sequentially through the year as the pricing and other actions take effect and we drive the business towards our objectives of revenue and profit growth in 2014 and beyond.", "Laura, we are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Hikmet, I heard you mention compliance and regulatory actions a few times. Anything new that wasn't contemplated before? I heard U.K. and Spain, I think. Any other countries that are new that are putting in some changes around remittances? And can you size maybe at a high level what the impact was on transactions, if possible?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, let me give you an overview and maybe I can give it also to Scott and he can be more in detail. But we, as a leading company of -- Western Union, are very committed to compliance, and we see that as a long-term competitive advantage. We do have some short-term adaption on our rules and changing the rules in some countries. It is no secret that the financial service overall gets more regulated. And within that also, we want to be best in class. We create this culture of compliance within our company. And we -- so that's the environment we are in currently, and we see that as a long-term competitive advantage. But we did have some impact in our business like Vigo. Maybe, Scott, you can give a little bit of color?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Tien-Tsin. let me give you a little bit of color. And as Hikmet said, that we're committed to a strong culture of compliance and invest in compliance programs. And let me give you a flavor of maybe some things that have been ongoing, not only in the first quarter but prior quarters, too. We're doing things that really protect the customer and protect the business. It might be things such as real-time risk assessment when the transaction happens at the point-of-sale, verification programs related to high principal transactions whereby we call back the sender and make sure the transaction is appropriate. But as Hikmet mentioned, we believe this will be a long-term competitive advantage for us. Near term, there are some headwinds, but it's the right investment to make in the business. We believe it will be a competitive advantage. And we continue to work towards that. As far as specific models or specific countries, we did mention the U.K. and Spain. Another one I might highlight is Venezuela, where we had to do some things to reenroll or reregister our customers, and we're largely through that in the middle of March -- were, in the middle of March from that standpoint. But we will continue to comply with the letter of the spirit of the law and really see that as a competitive advantage long term.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, okay, that makes sense. And just to be clear, these are broader sort of changes that apply to remittances? Or are they changes tied more towards broader payments, if you will? I'm just trying to understand how specific or narrow some of these rule changes are.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think it's general, Tien-Tsin. If you look at the regulatory, it starts with consumer protection, which we are very focused on that. It's not only remittances, it's just general. In the U.S., you are more familiar, is the Dodd-Frank issues, also the compliance issues. But also internationally, it's more on the compliance but also consumer protection activity, plus also the regulatory environment, right? I mean, we are fortunate that we are licensed in 200 countries. And so we are working very close to expand our relationship and adopting the regulatory environment. And it's not only in the U.S., it's globally. Everywhere, it's getting more -- all in financial service that general trends to more regulated.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Tien-Tsin, everything isn't necessarily black and white in a rule, but we work with regulators in countries around world to try to do the right thing for our business and for our customers.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood, understood, and that's good to know. Just quickly, just B2B, obviously, up 7. That was a pleasant surprise. We think C2B margin also improved a lot. Curious if both of those metrics are sustainable given what you saw in the first quarter.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think we are very focused. The team is working on the sales and the team is very -- we have a new process. The integration process is still going on, but we are in much better environment. The team is very focused on sales. And I would generally say that quarters may vary depending on the FX rates, everything. But generally, we are on the good path. I'm optimistic that it's a long-term good growth opportunity for Western Union.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Tien-Tsin, I would just add. Compared to 2012, we expect the revenue growth and the margin of the profitability profile of this business unit to improve. And long term, we expect this business to grow revenue in the low double digits. We only have a 2% share today.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right, no, glad to hear, glad to hear. Lastly, I promise, just buybacks, dividends going forward, given your U.S. cash situation. I mean, can you drive your future buybacks and dividends from operating cash flow? Or do you -- are you going to have to tap into the debt markets to do that or borrow to do that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Scott, maybe you can jump in. But first of all, we are very committed and glad to see that our strategies are working and we are performing against our strategies. As you know, Tien-Tsin, we are constantly, Scott and I, talking about our capital allocation and we are looking at -- we are constantly talking with the board. And we are very committed on our long-term shareholder value. And Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. What I'd add, Tien-Tsin, is that in the fourth quarter, we did buy back about the $350 million of stock. In the first quarter, $190 million. And in 2013, we've been very public about that we'll return about $700 million to our shareholders, roughly $400 million through buyback and $300 million through dividends. It now represents about 8% of our market cap. So pretty healthy return of capital. Specifically, coming back to your question, we do generate -- excluding the IRS payment, we'll make this year about $1 billion of cash flows. Now about roughly 3/4 of that is international, about 25% is U.S. So we do have cash flows from the U.S. that can fund buybacks. But we also have some room on our balance sheet. We're going to continue to target investment-grade credit rating. But we'll continue to have some room there as we think about it. But as Hikmet mentioned, we'll continue to talk with our management team and have periodic discussions with our board. But we have had a rich history of returning capital to our shareholders. We've got a franchise that does generate very strong cash flows.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, it's a percent of market cap, that's right.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You seem to have been showing some good early traction with regard to the pricing changes and elasticity around it. Can you give us a sense, first, how much of the price changes relative to your goal of the 25% of revenue change has actually been completed? And then really as a follow-up to that is how much have you actually marketed around it? In other words, while the changes could have occurred, is there a lot more to go in terms of awareness for your customers?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Tien-Tsin, if you look at our pricing actions, we are very pleased what happened currently. We implemented about 50% of the pricing actions, which are fully in the market -- starting to execute it. We are marketing it. And still, we started to have 75 initiatives -- 75% of our pricing actions, and more to come in Q2. We are looking by corridor by corridor. We are -- understand the customer needs. And I think the pricing action we put in place are working in high teens. And so I'm very pleased with the actions we're having in the place. And I think they are looking corridor by corridor. And as we outlined in the fourth quarter, we started to do that and it's working. And the learnings are -- we did hundreds of them, and these are the big ones. And we are focused on the issues and they are paying back.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. And I would just add, Hikmet, we did start the first quarter with only about 50% of the pricing actions implemented. By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, about 75%. And those pricing actions that we just put in place in the fourth quarter drove low-teens transaction growth. And so we continue to see more traction being built, more awareness being built. We'll continue to push more behind the marketing programs. And we expect those pricing actions to gain momentum and accelerate as we move through the quarters.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's helpful. Do you believe that the 25% number you originally quoted is still on tack? In other words, is it still just 25% of the business? Or is there any more than that now?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I think it's the 25%. We do it. We affirmed also the 2013 numbers. As you know they're in and I believe we're going to have a strong growth here, transactions growth, as projected Q1 numbers looks like very good. I mean, the rest of the corridor is business as usual. As you know, we do hundreds of them. We have 16,000 corridors globally. And our teams on the field are looking on that. So I don't see any additional pricing action -- investment than we said in last quarter from today's point of view.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick follow-up, and then I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the online business, have there been any more -- how substantial are the pricing changes online? And have there been any promotions going on, let's call it, like 1 month free for a certain corridor, something along those lines? And if so, I mean, is that -- how long is that? Is that a way to just operate the business because once you gain customers online, they stay, they're sticky and they stay with you?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Absolutely, Darrin. You are absolutely hitting the right point here. First of all, it's all about customer acquisition. We have 100 -- last year, we had $150 million revenue business. And I think we are expanding very fast. The strong growth on the transactions is the customer acquisition. And we see, once customers begin with us, they use us more. And we are still on track with our $500 million 2015 goal in revenue. And I think it's a great business. I think the team is doing a great job. I mean, even in the U.S. -- even in U.S., we are growing 70% transaction-wise. Globally, we are growing -- westernunion.com is growing 60%. So that's great numbers.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I know we talked about, this year, pricing for the C2C business to be down 6% to 7%. Now that you've gone through a lot of the pricing actions and are 75% through, does that look like the right number? Do you think it'll be -- does it have to be more than that? Or is that right on track to be what -- you're getting what you expected?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Bryan, it's tracking well to our expectations. Our pricing initiatives to improve our consumer value proposition are working. So as we communicated about 90 days ago, it's about 5% of our total company revenue, $300 million, or to your point, 6% to 7% of our C2C revenue from that standpoint. So we're seeing good progress in Mexico, from Europe to Africa, in the digital business. And again, I would say pricing is just one driver of how we're going to grow the business. We're going to add more locations. We're going to expand westernunion.com. We're going to evolve our product offerings so we can drop funds in the bank accounts and so forth. But what we feel like is the pricing we set is in the right range. And then longer term, we feel like we're going to be in that 1% to 3% range as we turn the calendar to 2014.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I just want to add on that, Scott. Bryan, as you know the business very well, its pricing is not the only thing we do. I'm very pleased with our expansion policy also on the network. I mean, we have more than 600,000 touch points if you exclude -- include also ATMs here. And recent signings, 10,000 additional locations are coming in Mexico. And that's doubling our Mexico network. Also, Egypt is a huge signing and Carrefour in Argentina. I think these are big signings coming and also more to expect to come. The teams are focused, and that will give us also the expansion and getting -- gaining more transactions.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. No, that's good to hear. And then just, Hikmet, it sounds like we've troughed in the transaction growth numbers. You expect them to improve in the second quarter and then improve especially in the back half of the year. Just your confidence level. I know that I've asked that question before, but I think it's key to see the transition. Are you -- how confident are you that the transaction numbers will start to turn? Because you've had a full quarter, well, at least a partial, a pretty good sized quarter to see the pricing actions take place. But the key to the story now is going to be to see the transaction numbers get better and that the first quarter was the trough.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I'm glad you're asking that question, Bryan. I am very confident about that. And the transaction -- we -- don't forget, as I mentioned earlier, only 50% of the pricing actions has been implemented in the market and 75% just started to be activated. And the early signings are very, very much looking very positive that -- as you know, usually, after 12 months, the revenue also picks back and comes back. One of the biggest we did that 3 years ago at DMT pricing actions and it came back revenue. I am very confident that 2014 and '15 will be a great growth years on revenues.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Last question for me. I guess, Scott, just when you're talking about some of these compliance changes, I know that's been going on throughout the world over the last probably couple of years, almost. But I noticed the guidance didn't change. So it doesn't seem like there's any change in the guidance due to kind of that ongoing kind of regulatory compliance issues that are out there.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, Bryan, you're right. We reaffirmed our guidance today. And again, the regulatory environment continues to evolve and change. And it's based upon what we know today as we reaffirm our guidance and so forth. But our goal is to comply with the letter and spirit of the law, have best-in-class compliance programs and really protect our customers and protect our businesses. Near term, it has been a little bit of a headwind. But we think that longer term, it will put us in a better competitive position.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Do you think those comps get easier in 2014 for those -- on a year-over-year basis for those compliance and regulatory charges?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Bryan, I think the general financial service industry is getting more regulated, and we are very focused on that. I think we have a great compliance team in place, and they are working hard. Generally, I see also being a market leader here as a competitive advantage. It's one of our investments. We don't see that as a cost or something, it's our investment to protect our customers and protect the company brand. I believe that's going to be a competitive advantage long term.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Have you seen any pricing reaction from competitors at this point? And do you have any sense where you're beginning to see the traction in transactions? Do you have any sense of where you're taking share from?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sara, generally, as you know, we have competition always. And as you know, this business is so complex. In 200 countries, we always have corridor specialists. Competition is always there. But on the big thing and the actions, where we've put in place, we did not see big competition reaction here yet. And we feel confident that we're going to gain market share there and we are going to transfer -- have more transactions. We see good pricing actions on U.S. to Mexico. We see U.S. to also Latin America corridors. And we do see Europe to Africa. And especially, our online transactions are growing very well. I mean, as I said, 60% growth in westernunion.com, 45% growth in electronic money transfer, account-based money transfer. These are good numbers. So where we put pricing and where we also expanded our network availability. I mean, you have to -- especially in dotcom, it also needs the physical location to send money. And that's -- you can send money from 23 countries to 200 countries via Western Union in minutes. So that's a big competitive advantage.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And the color I would add, Sara, is where have we taken market share. I'll give you a couple of data points. But Mexico, it's early days. But when you look at the first quarter, we grew at 9% with our brand, and Banco de Mexico reported the market for January and February had been down a couple of points. So we're gaining share there. When you think about Digital, Digital being up 60%. We know the electronic market's growing a little bit faster than the other market, but growing 60%, we're clearly taking share. And 80% of those customers are new to the franchise.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then separately, do you have any sense of how long it will take to get reported transaction growth in Mexico to turn positive as you benefit from the lower pricing?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I mean, in Mexico business, in total, we have also Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, which would impact our transactions. And that's -- as you know, we believe that, that will take a few quarters to overcome that. But on the westernunion.com -- Western Union branded transactions, I believe that we are going to continue to grow our transactions. And our revenue will usually catch up about 12 to 18 months. And so that will be approximately the timing, right, Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, yes. What I'd say on the transactions, if you will, the Western Union brand is already positive. It's growing 9% in the first quarter. And then the key thing we have to do, Sara, is we have to anniversary the Vigo and OV compliance issues we had in the third quarter of '12, where we took down 7,000 locations. So if you will, think about the fourth quarter for total company and transactions growing.", "Operator", "And our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Could you quantify the actual physical agent locations at the end of the March quarter and how much they were up or down year-over-year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We had 515,000 locations, and we added 20,000.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, compared to a year ago, we had 495,000. So we're up about 20,000 locations in the last past year, if you will. I think what's important is not only the locations that we've added, David, but we've got some rich pipeline, whether it's the bank in Egypt or in Mexico, where we're going to bring probably within a year, bring on another 10,000 locations online. We've got a good pipeline with signings, too.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I see. And then sticking to agents for a minute, can you quantify for us the increases in agent commission rates that you started to institute 1 quarter or 2 ago?", "Hikmet Ersek", "As you know our business, David, it depends on the year and quarterly agent renewals, right? Generally, not every agent renewal is in 1 year. It's spread over the years. It depends on the year. We had some increase on the CapEx this year due to agent signing bonuses. But generally, I would say that we are very focused on the agent commission and on our cost of services. I believe long term, we believe it will go down. And it's a win-win situation, right, David? I think -- but long term, we are very focused also to look at our variable costs.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Would you expect agent commissions to go up this year as a percentage of revenue?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "David, we are somewhat, if you will -- from our Q1 remarks, agent commissions did not impact the margins in the first quarter. So they were flat, if you will. We did renegotiate some agreements, primarily in the U.S., to really increase our competitive position. So we do expect that to pick up somewhat. But as we reaffirmed our guidance and in having approximately 20% margins, it's all baked in there.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "A quick final question on capital allocation, Scott. When does the board next take up the future dividend policy?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. Well, let me first talk about our philosophy and then -- and specifically to the board. But our goal is to have a balanced payout between buyback and dividend. And our goal with the dividend is to grow the dividend consistent with our business performance. And with that said, we did a large dividend increase in October, about 6, 7 months ago. And Hikmet and I periodically have discussions. We have 4, 5 board meetings a year. So we periodically have discussions with our board. And we'll continue to allocate our capital to invest in our business but also to get cash back to our shareholders. So it's probably worth repeating that our goal is to grow the dividend consistent with the business performance.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think it's 3.5% currently with...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, it's about 3.5% yield on the current stock price.", "Operator", "And our next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Scott, you had mentioned some of the new capabilities on wu.com. wu.com transactions accelerated, on my math, about -- was that 60% from 40%? Could you elaborate on what the source of some of the transaction volume acceleration might be?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure. We're very pleased with that business. In fact, Hikmet and I were in San Francisco last week, and the business team continues to perform really well there. So we're very excited. But there's a number of things that are driving it. One, I would say our pricing actions are helpful, that we have a strong consumer value proposition. We've also enhanced the website, if you will. So if you have an opportunity to use it from a consumer standpoint, the flow, the pages are better. It's more intuitive. We're also giving our customers -- we're not fully implemented yet, but giving our customers more options of how to pay in or pay out from a cash standpoint. And we continue to get more sophisticated from a risk management standpoint. So all of those things are helpful. It's hard to point to any one thing in particular. But all of those things are helpful. And we'll continue -- the good news is there is even more progress that we can make behind those. And that gives us confidence of being at a $500 million business top line in 2015. And I've said it, but it's worth repeating, that 80% of the customers are new. So we're attracting new customers into the franchise.", "Hikmet Ersek", "One thing I would like add on that also, don't forget that we are in 23 countries, currently originating westernunion.com transaction to 200 countries. As we speak, James, the team -- we just came from San Francisco. We just got back. The team is expanding new countries -- to new countries, and that will also gain -- have even a stronger transaction growth long term.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "With regard to the $500 million target in 2015, I was just wondering, what happens then?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Well, we want to grow further from there. That's just -- in my view, just the starting point is $500 million. We know the electronic market is growing a little bit faster than the other markets. We're growing at 60%. But again, we think there's a lot of opportunity to grow there, that we're seeing new customers come in. We can leverage our brand, leverage our global footprint. And where we're excited is we want to offer more payment capabilities such as a same-day ACH, we're not there. Or being able to drop money into a bank account around the globe. So the $500 million is just a data point, 2015, but we've got aspirations to grow well on that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I think it also reminds me on the retail Money Transfer. As we build the retail Money Transfer, we expanded country by country by country. And as we do the retail Money Transfer expansion, the same goes with the westernunion.com expansion. And combining these 2 things, I think it's a huge opportunity also for the future.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Last thing for me, with regard to the new Mexico affiliates, this is encouraging to see you investing in that market again. I was just wondering, are those arrangements exclusive? And if that's not the appropriate question then, could you talk about who you may have taken those relationships from?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, as you know, parts of them -- I can't go into details, but parts of them are we have good, strong -- let me leave it there. We have good, strong relationship. More to come on that, more in detail. For competitive reasons, I don't want to talk about the details of the agreement. But I'm very confident that we did the right steps. We worked very hard. And I personally was there last week, and I'm very confident that we are -- you're going to see more growth coming from Mexico.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. I guess I wanted to first ask about the margins, which were better than we expected. Scott, how much of that was due to timing of some of the onetime investments you were planning to make in the quarter versus kind of sustainable actions in terms of simplifying the business over time? And how should we think about the progression of the onetime costs as we move through the year?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Sure. Phil, it was really -- it was primarily timing, if you will, of some of our investments but also our cost savings initiatives, the cost related to those. So as you recall from the call, we did reaffirm the full year EPS and the approximate 20% margins, if you will. Our cost savings programs are tracking well. In fact, we expect to spend about $45 million in 2013. And Phil, I'd have you think probably more so in the second and third quarter, where you'll see a lot of that being spent with our actions. That will generate about $30 million of savings in 2013, and importantly, if not more importantly, about $45 million in savings in 2014. So we're tracking well there.", "Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Is that $45 million number different than what you've said in February? I thought we had $65 million.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "No. Let me give you the color. The $45 million is the same. We also will incur $20 million of Travelex integration expenses in 2013. We don't expect that $20 million to repeat in 2014. That's probably where you came up with the $65 million.", "Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Understood, okay. On the -- going back to the transaction trends. Do you guys have any data that would be helpful in terms of understanding the momentum through the quarter, either by month or what you've seen through April so far, so we could get a sense of how the pricing actions are gaining traction?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. Probably as you know, Phil, consistent with our past practices, because of calendar impact and other things, we don't necessarily talk about any given month or the month that we're in as we release earnings. But what we've seen through the first quarter, through April, clearly gives us confidence, early indications that our plans are working. We're seeing those markets we priced in the fourth quarter with high-teens -- or I'm sorry, low-teens transaction growth. And we reaffirmed our guidance today. So we're tracking well to our expectations on the plan with pricing.", "Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question on the buyback. I mean, you did a lot in the first quarter. Should we expect it to be a little more ratable as we move through the course of this year? And what was the share count at the end of the quarter?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "As far as the buyback, we did buy back 350 million in the fourth quarter, 200 million -- or 190 million in the first quarter. We have 200 million remaining. So we will take a number of things into consideration as far as uses of our capital, other factors from that standpoint. Hikmet and I continue to have dialogue with our board around buyback and capital deployment. So we'll continue to deploy the capital. We think given where the stock price is at, it's a good investment, if you will. To your question on how many shares were outstanding, we have 559 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "On the principal transaction account and principal mix, can you just talk a little bit about what drove that, the slight dip there on the principal? I think you guys you mentioned something on the call. I might have missed it upfront.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "You're looking at principal per transaction? Is that what you're asking, Julio?", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, yes, yes, sorry.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "It was down 1%, although when you look at the last 3 or 4 quarters, that's an improvement where it was down 3%, down 2%. So some of the pricing actions that we've done, we've seen some new customers enter the high principal bands. And so we've seen some -- in certain quarters, some uplift with the higher principal bands, but that is actually trending a little bit more favorable compared to what it was the last 2 or 3 quarters.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then looking at the percentage of revenues. I think you guys disclosed a eChannels versus a wu.com segment. What's the difference between those 2? Like what other revenue contributors would be in the eChannels versus the wu.com revenues?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. In the eChannels, it's 4% of revenue. If you just look at westernunion.com, it's 3%. So the simple delta is account-based Money Transfer. That business was up 45% in the first quarter. But it represents about 1% of our revenues. So westernunion.com is 3%, account-based is 1%, gives you the 4%.", "Hikmet Ersek", "4%, yes. Electronic Money Transfer, Julio, as you recall.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Through the bank, over on the online banking platforms.", "Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just lastly, profitability on Business Solutions. Is there a target for the year when you guys expect to see that turn profitable again?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Well, we're pleased with where we've been. If you just take the first quarter EBITDA and if you exclude integration costs, the margins were up 14%. Comparable period a year ago, the margin was 8%. So we've made good progress. Our goal in that business is to improve the profitability in 2013 compared to 2012. And longer term, as we've mentioned, we believe this business can grow in the low double digits and can have EBITDA margins comparable to the company. So we'll kind of take it one quarter at a time. But we do like the revenue growth we saw. We like the profitability improvement. And we think it's a very leverageable business model from a scale standpoint.", "Operator", "And our final question today will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up question on wu.com. As we think about 2014 and 2015, as you guys march towards the $500 million target, which is encouraging to hear you reiterate that, are you assuming stable pricing, more or less, for wu.com beyond 2013 as part of that $500 million target?", "Hikmet Ersek", "As you know, Jason -- thank you for asking the question. I think that's a great question. We are currently only on 4,500 corridors with our westernunion.com. As we expand to the corridors, we always adapt our pricing corridor by corridor, as you know, and that may change. But I would say that generally, we have the right pricing now that attracts so many transactions. And I know that the customer, once they join us, they use us much more often. So I believe that the pricing strategy is in the right moment. And as we expand to new countries, we will adapt our pricing to the countries. And I think it's, long term, a profitable business. Especially -- today, we are using the credit card payments mostly. And once we also adapt our payments via comp payments, we have also lower interchange fee. And on the send side, we don't have the agent commission. So I think it's -- long term, it's a very, very profitable, very great business.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, the reason I asked, just thinking ahead about the pricing, obviously, the gap is huge right now between revenue and transaction growth because of the price cuts. And I know you had a tough comparison on revenue growth here in Q1. It just -- it seems like even if you accelerate the full year revenue growth in wu.com this year to, I don't know, call it 25% or so, from 13% in Q1. I think you still need a CAGR north of about 60% over 2014 and 2015 to get to the $500 million bogey. But it sounds like a lot of that growth, you would expect to come not necessarily from just more transactions and revenue in the existing markets, but as you had alluded to earlier, just expanding wu.com to a lot more countries. That's clearly part of the story here?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, Jason, yes, you're absolutely right. I think by expanding -- and I think we have a roadmap, and we are checking this monthly and daily against our $500 million goal. And we are reconfirming the goal of $500 million again.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last one for me. I think in the past, you've made some general comments that Western Union carries approximately a 20% or so price premium to the competition. And obviously, that varies by corridor. But curious kind of how that figure looks after all of the current price cuts are implemented. And would that current or new premium be more or less sustainable over the longer term based on how you see the market right now?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think yes, we deserve a premium because of -- given our global reach, given our quality, given the protecting the customer brand. I think our brand deserves a premium. And don't forget that we don't do everywhere-pricing, right. In certain corridors where we have to adjust the numbers. And I believe that we deserve a premium price and that it's going to continue.", "Michael A. Salop", "Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us for the call today. And have a good afternoon. We'll talk to you soon.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Earlier this year, we reoriented our strategy for growing our global business so we could return to revenue and profit growth in 2014 by strengthening Consumer Money Transfer, increasing customers' end usage in Business Solutions and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. We said we could restore our competitive position and drive future growth.", "Now halfway through a transitional 2013, our second quarter performance shows we have made substantial progress in achieving these objectives and demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business models.", "As we expected, our second quarter Consumer Money Transfer transaction growth rates accelerated compared to the first quarter, as our pricing actions continue to build momentum with consumers. Electronic channels growth also increased, with strong contributions from both westernunion.com and electronic account-based money transfer through banks.", "Western Union Business Solutions delivered a second consecutive quarter of solid growth and, more importantly, initiated new services, partnerships and markets to drive future performance. And additionally, Consumer Bill Payments improved, with strong constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. While consolidated operating margins are down from last year, as expected, partially as a result of our strategic pricing and other actions, we remain solidly on track with our full year financial outlook, and we are affirming our 2013 guidance.", "Before turning the call over to Scott to discuss our financial results in more detail, let me give a few examples of progress on each of our key strategic priorities for 2013.", "In Consumer Money Transfer, we are seeing that our pricing actions are having the desired effect. In Mexico, Western Union brand transactions increased 22% in the quarter. This was an improvement from the 9% growth in the first quarter and 2% in last year's fourth quarter, when we first implemented the price reductions. We are regaining momentum in Mexico, which should also be aided by activating new agent locations over the next several quarters. The price actions in other corridors are also performing well. And, overall, we are meeting our transaction objectives for the priced corridors.", "Entering the second quarter, we have completed about 75% of the planned pricing initiatives. In these priced corridors, transactions increased 17% in the quarter, or 11% if you exclude westernunion.com. Prior to implementing the pricing, transactions in these retail corridors were decreasing slightly, so we are seeing a good lift in consumer usage. The westernunion.com online pricing actions are also yielding very strong results. Overall, westernunion.com Money Transfer transaction growth accelerated to 68% in the quarter. As of end of June, we have initiated substantially all of the previously planned pricing actions.", "We also made progress in other areas to strengthen Consumer Money Transfer for the future by further increasing the number of agent locations, expanding our electronic channels, introducing more direct-to-bank services and becoming more mobile. Our total agent locations increased to 520,000 as of end of the quarter. We remain focused on adding productive new locations and other points of presence, although there have been some offsets, as we remove some locations that were dormant or required compliance-related changes.", "We mentioned last quarter that we have signed agents in Mexico, which will give us approximately 10,000 new locations there once implemented. And we also just greatly expanded in Germany. In July, 3,000 additional locations were activated with the German POS bank increasing our presence in that country by over 50%.", "I am pleased with the new relationships we continue to formulate. Recently, we added a major new bank in Saudi Arabia with the signing of Riyad Bank, which will offer both cash and account-based money transfer services in one of the world's top 3 outbound markets for remittances. And this month, in the U.S., we also activated 1,500 agent locations with SunTrust bank, which has a strong branch network across the Southern states.", "Electronic channels revenue increased 26% in the second quarter. Westernunion.com Money Transfer transactions increased 68%, and account-based Money Transfer transactions increased 51%, as we activated new services with banks in Turkey, Jordan and Vietnam. We now have over 70 banks connected for account-based money transfer service.", "Earlier this month, I was in India for the launch of a new direct-to-bank service, which give us the capability to send money transfers from westernunion.com and agents location in the U.S. and U.K. directly into a bank account in India. Direct-to-bank is a large market opportunity that we plan to develop over the coming years.", "I also visited Nigeria, where we are working to expand account-based and mobile money transfer services with both banks and mobile network operators. We now have 17 active partners globally for mobile money transfer. And our money transfer services are also available for bank customers at approximately 115,000 ATMs, including new rollouts with banks in Thailand and Turkey. Providing both senders and receivers of their choice of channel is a key element of our money transfer strategy, and we continue to add online, mobile and account-based options for our foundational retail network around the world.", "Western Union is uniquely positioned to connect the digital and physical world for money transfer, and we believe these new channels will be a key driver of future growth. Overall, we are on track with our plans for Consumer Money Transfer in 2013, and we continue to expect our Western Union brand C2C transactions to increase mid- to high-single digit for the full year.", "Our second strategic initiative for 2013 is to drive growth in customers and usage in business-to-business. And during the quarter, we made solid progress. Western Union Business Solutions delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter, or 8% in constant currency terms. We are gaining traction in the market with our refocused sales efforts and continue to expand our service offerings and capabilities.", "In the quarter, we launched a new service with the MasterCard Business Network, where we provide cross-border payment services to their business customers. The network is an online resource that help streamline business operations and enhance productivity for small- and mid-sized businesses.", "We also significantly expanded our services in India and Japan. And we increased offerings for university student cross-border tuition payment services in several countries, including China, India and South Korea. Business Solutions now offers cross-border payments services in 32 countries, with Colombia being the most recent addition. Although we still believe we can generate stronger business solutions growth in the future, as global trade recovers and our new services and market contribute more meaningfully, we are pleased with the progress we have made so far in 2013.", "Our third strategic initiative for 2013 is to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders. Year-to-date, through June, we generated $478 million of cash flow from operating activities and returned over $450 million to shareholders. This consisted of $314 million of share repurchases and $140 million of dividends.", "As Scott will discuss in a moment, we continue to expect to generate $900 million of operating cash flow for the year, with approximately $700 million returned to shareholders, representing approximately 7% of the current market capitalization.", "So based on the year-to-date performance and current trends, we have affirmed our full year financial outlook. Our Consumer Money Transfer actions are meeting our objectives, with Western Union brand transactions increasing 7% in the second quarter, up from a 2% increase in the first quarter.", "Electronic channels are growing rapidly, with revenue growth of 26%, compared to 18% last quarter. And we are adding more choices and convenience for consumers around the world. Business Solutions is picking up momentum, with constant currency revenue growth of 8% compared with 7% last quarter. Consumer Bill Payments is delivering good constant currency revenue growth of 7%, up from 3% last quarter. And we continue to generate strong cash flow.", "So far, our strategic actions are working, and we remain confident that these actions will lead to revenue and profit growth in 2014.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we are making in our key businesses, and we are affirming our full year financial outlook for 2013.", "In the second quarter, we reported total consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion, which was down 3% compared to the year ago quarter, or 2% on a constant currency basis. Pricing investments and compliance actions led to C2C revenue decline, as expected, but the rate of decline moderated compared to the first quarter, as transaction growth accelerated. As Hikmet mentioned, Business Solutions and Consumer Bill Payments each delivered good revenue growth in the quarter.", "In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue declined 4%, or 3% constant currency. The decline included a negative 1% impact from the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, which are still being affected by the compliance-related changes implemented in the third quarter of 2012. Transaction growth for Western Union brand accelerated to 7% in the second quarter compared to 2% in the first quarter. The second quarter growth was driven by the pricing actions and strong performance in the electronic channels. Overall transactions, including the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, increased 3%, up from a decline of 2% in the first quarter.", "C2C cross-border principal increased 2% in the quarter, with no impact from currency, while Western Union branded cross-border principal increased 5%, including a negative 1% impact from currency. Total principal per transaction declined 1%. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was 7 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency.", "For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 7% in the quarter, while mix had a positive impact of approximately 1%. We continue to expect the full year pricing investments to be approximately 6% to 7% of C2C revenue, or approximately 5% of total company revenue.", "Turning to the regions. All of the regions delivered improved transaction growth rates compared with the first quarter trends. In the Europe and CIS region, C2C revenue decreased 4% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency. Transactions in the region increased 3%, aided primarily by pricing actions and continued strong growth in markets, such as Germany and France.", "North America revenue declined 12% from the prior year, while transactions were down 2%. The transaction decline was driven by the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, while revenue was also impacted by price reductions. Mexico revenue, including Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, declined 23%, and transactions decreased 3% in the quarter.", "For the Western Union brand, Mexico revenue declined 11%, while transaction growth accelerated to 22%. The Western Union brand grew significantly faster than the market based on the Banco de Mexico data available for April and May.", "Domestic money transfer revenue was down 1% on transaction growth of 5% in the quarter. The difference between transaction and revenue was attributable to fewer large principal transfers at price reductions in westernunion.com. Lower principal bands and domestic money transfer continued to perform well, with increases in both transactions and revenue.", "Revenue in the Middle East and Africa region was flat compared to the year-ago quarter with no impact from currency, and transactions grew 6%. We're seeing good results from our pricing actions from Europe to Africa, and the Gulf states are providing steady growth.", "Asia-Pacific region revenue was down 4% in the quarter, including a negative 1% impact from currency translation, while transactions in the region increased 5%. The Latin American Caribbean region revenue was flat with the prior year period, including a negative 7% impact from currency, while transactions declined 3%. Revenue in the region was positively impacted by geographic and product mix, although this was offset by currency translation.", "Turning to our digital business. Westernunion.com again delivered strong results, with Money Transfer transaction growth of 68% and a revenue increase of 25% in the quarter. U.S.-originated online transactions increased over 75% in the quarter.", "Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks, and mobile increased 26% in the quarter. Electronic channels represented 4% of total company revenue, up from 3% of revenue in the year-ago period.", "In addition to the strong growth from westernunion.com, transactions from account-based money transfer through banks increased 51%. Prepaid revenue, including third-party reload, declined 9% in the quarter, primarily due to softness in our U.S. business.", "Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue increased 2% in the quarter, or 7% in constant currency terms. Good growth in South America and in the U.S. electronic business drove the Consumer Bill Payment improvement, with a partial offset from decline in the U.S. cash walk-in business.", "Business Solutions reported another solid quarter with revenue growth of 6% or 8% constant currency. Both spot payments and customer hedging activity contributed to the growth, with particularly strong performance from the U.K. and several countries in Asia. The acquisition of the French Travelex Global Business Payments business, which was completed in May of 2012, contributed 1 point to the Business Solutions growth in the quarter.", "Turning to consolidated margins. As expected, the second quarter GAAP operating margin was 20%, compared to 24.3% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily the result of increased compliance costs; pricing-driven revenue declines in mix; strategic investments, primarily in IT; expenses for cost-savings initiatives; and higher marketing. These impacts were partially offset by lower Travelex integration expense.", "There were approximately $14 million of expenses related to the cost-savings initiatives in the quarter. Increased compliance costs included additional expenses related to anticipated extension of our Southwest Border agreement. As noted in an 8-K filing in June, we agreed with the State of Arizona to extend the current Southwest Border agreement, which was due to expire on July 31, by an additional 90 days. The extension is intended to give both parties time to discuss potential amendments to the settlement agreement, which may include further extending the terms to allow additional time to implement the monitor's recommendations.", "EBITDA margin was 24.8% compared to 28.4% a year ago. Reported earnings per share in the quarter were -- was $0.36 compared to $0.44 in the prior year.", "The C2C operating segment margin was 23.2% compared to 28.5% in the prior year period. The margin was impacted in the quarter primarily by increased compliance costs, strategic investments, price-driven revenue declines and mix, expenses related to cost-savings initiatives and higher marketing.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 20.5% compared to 22.4% in the prior year period. The margin was negatively impacted compared to prior year by pass-throughs to billers of Durbin-related debit card savings, which reduced revenue.", "Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $7 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $15 million in the year-ago period. The reduction in operating loss was primarily driven by lower Travelex integration expense.", "The second quarter $7 million loss includes $15 million of depreciation and amortization and $6 million of Travelex integration expense. The second quarter of last year depreciation and amortization was $15 million, while integration expense was $14 million.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $478 million. Capital expenditures were $69 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.4 billion. Approximately 50% of the cash was held by United States entities.", "During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares at an average price of $15.92, totaling $125 million. In addition, we paid $69 million in dividends. Earlier this month, we also declared another $0.125 quarterly dividend, which will be paid on September 30.", "As of quarter end, we have 552 million shares outstanding, approximately $80 million remaining under our repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013. We continue to project 2013 repurchases and dividends to total approximately $700 million this year, or about 7% of current market capitalization, including $400 million of share repurchases.", "We expect to generate approximately $900 million of cash flow from operations or approximately $1 billion, excluding the remaining $100 million of tax payments from our 2011 IRS agreement. These payments are included in our 2013 cash flow outlook, although it is possible that some of the payments may not occur until 2014. We are affirming the 2013 full year financial outlook that we provided in April.", "As we stated at the end of last year, we expect 2013 to be a transitional year, as we implement our strategic actions. And we are pleased with the progress we made during the first half of the year.", "Laura, we are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about just industry growth in general. It sounds like -- listening to your comments, Hikmet, and then, obviously, what your peers have said, it feels like industry growth is improving. Can you elaborate on that? I'm just curious if it's safe to say that there's an improvement in industry growth, broadly speaking?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, fortunately we are acting in a market which is growing in totally. As you know, especially, cross-border remittance market is what World Bank says got 5% to 6% growth approximately [indiscernible].", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, about 6%, yes. And [indiscernible] too, in principal.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And [indiscernible] too, also. It's about 5%, 6% growth in principal amount. So obviously, revenue is a little bit different on that part. But, generally, I would say that I'm very pleased with our performance. And as you recall that we said that last year, we're going to implement all these actions. The actions are working. And to gain -- and our -- to gain market share. And we are very pleased with the results. Just to give an example, Western Union-branded transaction. Mexico, growing by 22%, up from 9%. And it was lower than little [ph] quarter before. So I think the actions are working. Also, the other actions on the different parts of the world are working. And price is not the only one, right, which impacts. We are having 520,000 locations. Electronic channels are growing very fast. We have 115,000 ATMs. So being everywhere, anywhere and serving the customers, it does work, so I am pleased with the progress we made.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two quick, just, clarifications. Just transaction growth in the quarters where pricing was not addressed. It looked like it accelerated from 1% to 5%. Are we calculating that correctly, Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, yes, it's correct. It was right around 4%, Tien-Tsin, but the specific number is 4%. But we feel good about those corridors too and the progress that we saw.", "Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So it did accelerate. And lastly, just any impact on transactions, in general, from all the FX volatility? I know that was called out with -- at Xoom, so, especially, with the rupee move. Any impact on transactions worth calling out?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "I'd say, in simple terms, no. Consumers do vary their behavior a little bit. But the Indian rupee, there was some movement there. But we're in 200 countries. India is a very important market. But consumers, their loved ones have needs, so they routinely send money back. So didn't have a significant impact on our results this quarter.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Just a reminder, Tien-Tsin. We have 123 currencies, which the customer uses, right? So that's, definitely, also something. We don't see the impact on that so much.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask about going forward. Do you still expect the transaction growth to accelerate in the third and the fourth quarters, just given what you see so far?", "Hikmet Ersek", "The answer is yes. The answer is yes. And we are affirming our year-end guidance, as you know. And part of it is the acceleration of the transaction growth, and the pricing actions are working. We have now implemented -- or activated 75% of them, implemented all of the pricing actions. And they should work. And the -- and non-priced corridors are also growing 1% to 4% abroad. So, generally, I see a good momentum.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then, Scott, can you remind us when OV and Vigo -- I know it's been a tough comp here. When does that anniversary? Is that in the middle of this quarter?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, it'd be in the middle of the third quarter, so we'll have some of it through the third quarter. And then the fourth quarter would be the first, I'll say, clean quarter, if you will, Bryan, where the comps get easier from that standpoint.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, fourth is more to measure it -- better to measure it.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just, finally, for me, the -- do you still expect pricing to return to its normal declines of 1% to 3% cycle in 2014 after giving the pricing initiatives this year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I believe that we did a big investment in 2012, which affects 2013 numbers. Generally, I would say that it's not only pricing. I think we really pulled this strategy here, which we are -- our focus is revenue and profit growth for '14. And to achieve that, there are many factors too, and pricing is one of them. I don't see that we're going to have a big investment as we did it in -- from today's point of view, as we did it in -- in end of 2012.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Smittipon Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First question is, I was wondering if you guys are seeing any different in the trends in this round of price reductions versus past rounds of price reductions that you guys have implemented.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Smitti, I would say we're in 200 countries, 16,000 corridors, so you do get some variations. But I'd say that the key headline is the price investments are working. And in those corridors, we did make pricing investments. Transactions were up 17%, so they're spot on to our objectives.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And for westernunion.com, are the top corridors that you have in that business similar to the top corridors that you have in the off-line space?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally, yes. But if you look at our business, we are in 32 countries in westernunion.com, or is it...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "We're -- yes, we're in 23 countries.", "Hikmet Ersek", "23, I'm sorry -- to 23 countries and sending to 200 countries. So you can multiple to -- from 200 countries, which means that we are serving many, many corridors, right? And our goal is to expand these countries, adding more and more countries, which means that adding more and more corridors and, eventually, being in 200 countries with our westernunion.com and electronic channels. And the team is working very hard on that.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Roman in for Julio. First, a clarification question in Mexico. The agent locations that are to be added there, are these agents that have been signed up and just, they need to be implemented? Or do these include some of that, perhaps, are in the pipeline and not yet signed up?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, they have been signed up. Giving the time to implement them. It takes time to implement that. You have to activate the IT systems and everything and the programs -- compliance programs, so -- but we have signed them.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. And just to be clear, Roman, we have signed about 10,000 locations that'll roll out in the next 12 months, but they are signed agreements.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great, okay. We noticed the headlines, so that's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, and we can speak specifically to Mexico or other corridors. But as you add agent locations in corridors that you repriced, how did the dynamics work there? Are you trying to manage the pricing a little differently with these new agents? Or are you -- is the pricing going to be the same as the new prevailing prices in those corridors?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Generally speaking, we price to the market and where we see the consumer value proposition lies. So as new agents come on board, what they love about our business is the strength of our brand that we can connect 520,000 locations. We have westernunion.com for -- on the payout side. So, if you will, the pricing market-by-market will vary. But generally, we treat all the agents the same, which is important to our brand and who we are.", "Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, finally, on Business Solutions. What type of revenue growth do we need to see there in the near term to get to profitability? The integration expense coming down, obviously, helps. But what kind of top line performance do we need to see there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. As I stated in last time, we do see a long-term, lower double-digit growth rate in this business. I think, now we accelerated our constant currency revenue growth from 7% to 8%. And I think the team is really, really focused and expanding also the countries there have been. So we have a roadmap to go there. And that will definitely help the bottom line. But maybe, Scott, you want to add something on the...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, yes. The only other color I would give to add to Hikmet's comments. If you look at the margins on a year-to-date basis, EBITDA margins, minus the integrations expense, those margins are in the neighborhood of 14%, if you will, so it is profitable today. And those margins are up compared to a year-to-date basis from the prior year. And so as we expand to more countries, as we gain scale, as we launch more products -- for example, we've launched the options in the U.K. in the last quarter. We signed a deal with MasterCard this quarter that we're excited about. So as we generate that long-term, that low, double-digit revenue growth, the scale and leverage should allow us to get EBITDA margins comparable to the company average.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Can you comment on the prepaid business? Just looks likes it's kind of weakening there. What are your thoughts, broadly, on the opportunity in U.S. and north and as well as international?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I'd go with -- maybe...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Go ahead, Hikmet, yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "If you like to add something -- if you look, our prepaid business is a small part of our business today. It's around 1% of our revenue. And it has been a little bit difficult to build the awareness and get the advantages of that. However, it does open to Western Union brand. All these cards are Western Union-branded cards. And once the customer gets the loyalty, it uses also potential other products. And what we do is that we are really bringing the prepaid customers to our core business. Is it cash in, cash out, or using the Money Transfer or Bill Payment businesses? Do you want to add something on that?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "No. I think, Greg, the other opportunity for us, well, as Hikmet kind of mentioned, is to take our prepaid business, which we think is a nice long-term opportunity. But we're experimenting with some different business models in different countries and better connect that back to the core business, which we think leverages our brand, our distribution and our customer base. So we want to, as the years come, kind of tighten those a little bit closer together as we move forward.", "Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And then, just if you step back and think about your business as it's moving to digital channels. And is that happening faster than maybe you would have expected a year ago or slower or, obviously, about as expected?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, it's really -- if you recall, we said that we want to accelerate our growth here. Don't forget that we had -- 2%, 3%, 4% of our total revenue is non-electronic channels. The westernunion.com, as you know, that we opened an office in San Francisco. And this team is doing great. It's growing by 68% on transactions. We are right on our plan to achieve, well, approximately $500,000 -- $500 million by year 2015. And the revenues also accelerated from 18% to 26% in this quarter. So we have a roadmap to get there on westernunion.com and our digital business. One good thing is also on the digital business, electronic account-based money transfer business. We have now 70 banks globally on that. And where you go to your electronic banking account and you click and send money worldwide to 200 countries, and that grew by 51%. So I think our strategies on the electronic channels are working. Last year, just to give it a -- just to compare with the environment, last year, revenue was $150 million on westernunion.com. And this is something that -- we want to bring that to $500 million by end of year 2015.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And the other color I would add, Greg, which I think is important too, really, 2 things, is one is that we're really well positioned to bring together the best of the electronic world and the retail world with our brand and our network. But, also, on the electronic channel with dot-com, 80% of the customers we're seeing are new.", "Operator", "And our next question is from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.", "Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Ryan Davis calling in for George. I have a few questions. First off, kind of following up on the question earlier on the second half of the year. Could you kind of give us an update on the July trends, whether there's a big acceleration in transactions in your quarter relative to the second quarter?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Ryan, this is Scott. Thanks for joining us this morning. But as customary with our past practice, we do not comment on trends within a quarter during a quarter. But what I will say is that we're cognizant of what those trends are. And, if you will, led to the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for 2013. So we're pleased with how the year-to-date results have been through June. And our outlook gives us confidence to reconfirm the guidance.", "Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Can you provide us some color on how the transactions progress throughout 2Q monthly?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. I'll just come back to my prior comments. Just consistent with past practices, we don't comment month-by-month. And the reason being is you have holidays or calendar impact and other things. But again, what we saw in the first quarter and the second quarter, again, transactions increased from 2% in the first quarter to 7% in the second quarter, very nice acceleration. And those priced markets went up 17% growth. So all those things give us confidence that our strategy is working. Customers love the brand and the network. They're coming back in the front door, so we did reaffirm guidance.", "Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, one more. What's driving principal per transaction lower on a constant currency basis? I just thought it was the aggressive online channel. Shouldn't that kind of be reversed?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, just to frame it. For the quarter, it was down about 1%. I think one of the key points is C2C transactions grew 7%, so customers came back in the front door. The one item that's having some impact on that, and we called it out during the call, is domestic money transfer. The high principal sends there were down somewhat. But overall, what we really like about our business model is that if the transactions come in the door, what's the most important thing is getting the transaction. And that really drives our revenue model.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Merrill Lynch.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is David Chu for Sara. How should we think about pricing for the second half? So should we expect a more significant impact in 3Q versus 2Q and then like less of an impact in 4Q, as you have lapped some of the Mexico initiative?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. David, thank you for your question. How I frame it is from a customer transaction standpoint, we do expect transactions to accelerate in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. As far as lapping pricing, we did start the pricing actions mid-November of 2012, so we'll begin lapping those in mid-November of 2013.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, when you look at the reporting, David, I mean, the actions themselves are largely done. We've -- after the end of the quarter -- as of end of the quarter, we completed most of the pricing. But when you look at the reporting, in the third quarter, it probably is going to be the highest, because all the actions will be in place and then we start anniversary-ing, as Scott said, in the fourth quarter.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe this is a little bit early, but are you seeing anything in the market place that suggests a meaningful pickup in compliance costs in 2014?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "What I'd say, David, is that having a robust compliance program and a strong culture of compliance is very important to us. And so, broadly, as we think about the global landscape, the regulatory environment continues to move. So as I think about '14 and '15, right now, I'd expect our compliance regulatory cost to increase. But what's important about that is that it protects the brand, it protects the customer, it protects our agents. And longer term, we believe that's going to be a competitive advantage because of our scale and our scope of what we can do with compliance and the regulatory.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I'd just add on that. I do see that as a competitive advantage. We have really the culture in our company. And most importantly, it protects the consumer. And it has been some investment down here. I believe it will continue to -- we're going to have those investments. But long term, as Scott said, I just want to repeat that, I believe it will be -- given our scale, it will be a competitive advantage. But don't forget, we are in 200 countries. We comply with all regulations world and try to be the best in class and leading in this industry here.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And just last one, if I may. So are most of your larger agent renewals for 2013 finished at this point, or is there more in the second half?", "Hikmet Ersek", "If you look at our agent network globally, we have always negotiations constantly, being in 200 countries, have a global agent network. And as I said, we recently added new agent negotiations -- we had new agent negotiations, and we added new agents. And one of the best one was probably the Riyad Bank in Saudi Arabia or 10,000 locations in Mexico, so it's constantly growing. And we activate the SunTrust Bank in the U.S.. So I think that seasonality, year-by-year, it changes, but most of the -- we have constant negotiation with the agents. Most of the contracts are 5-year contracts in average, so it comes every time.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And what I'd add is I'd say, we enjoy high renewal rates. The example I would give is our top 40 agents have been with us for an average of 17 years. They very much value the brand, the customers that we bring to their locations and our network.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP", "You've had some large declines in yields in the online channel for several quarters now. How much longer do you think it'll take for your actions to anniversary here? And can you give us your best estimate of the delta between your online pricing and the competitors'? And then, secondly, your differential between your online pricing versus your offline pricing as best as apples-to-apples as you can?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Maybe you can give him some detail on that. But let me start how we see that. We do see it corridor by corridor. Probably you're asking the question, \"What's your online pricing in the U.S. against the competition?\" I just want to say that our U.S.-originated transactions last quarter grow by 75%. The biggest advantage of we're seeing is that online, we serve from one point 200 countries. If you have our Germany, online transfer, we serve from Germany 200 countries. So that's the biggest advantage. And we adapt our pricing corridor by corridor. We pick up corridors, and we do price promotions on that.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And Glenn, what I would add there is that we will lap the western.com (sic) [westernunion.com] pricing in November, so we'll grow through that, if you will. But just with transactions being up 68% in the second quarter, I think that's a very strong statement from our customers that they very much value the consumer proposition. So whether it's the attribute of price, the brand, the customer payout, customers truly like the business. And in the U.S., U.S., we saw over 75% transaction growth from second quarter.", "Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP", "Okay. And then, just thinking about pricing actions outside of where you've been active over the last couple of quarters, and what you're going through now, are there any rumblings of measures you might have to take elsewhere? You haven't mentioned it, but I just wanted to see if there's any texture of things we should be aware of? Any rumblings just to avoid any surprises over the coming quarters of new pricing -- new larger-scale pricing implementation?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Glenn, so far, so good. Our pricing, non-priced corridor's growing by 4%, 75% of our business, as you know. But it's so far, so good. I feel comfortable with the progress. Pricing, as you know, Glenn, our business very well. It's only a part of our actions. It's the -- we, as Western Union, I believe deserve the premium pricing. Our brand is very valuable. Our compliance programs are very valuable. We are protecting the customers. The customers trust us. And we do really choose corridor by corridor. And pricing is nothing new for us. We did the last 10 to 15 years, corridor by corridor, different pricing. But I don't see, from today's point of view, a big investment -- corrective investment, transformational investment. We did it in last year, 2012.", "Operator", "And that final question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I also wanted to ask about the regulatory. Earlier in the year, you had described the regulatory is getting hotter, and you had outlined the mandatory callback obligations. I was wondering, do those -- are those obligations mandatory callback, extending to other corridors? And how you would characterize regulatory at wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] versus WU off line?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, first, I think the important point is that we very much have a culture of compliance and want to have best-in-class compliance programs. That's very important for our brand, protecting our customers, our agents and so forth. As we think about compliance, broadly, we are doing things such as high principal dollar callback to protect the customer. That's what we want to do. We have expanded that to other markets and other corridors. And we'll continue from time to time to implement things to protect the customers and to protect the agents.", "Michael A. Salop", "That's for both wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] and off-line.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, thank you, Mike -- for both channels.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Yes. Okay, interesting. And then with regard to wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] I was just wondering, and I hadn't heard you mention this before, if you have, I apologize. But being that wu.com (sic) [westernunion.com] is more of a one-to-many as opposed to one-to-one model. Are you seeing customers use it to remit to multiple countries? Or is that behavior any different than the typical pattern of one sender to one country?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, if you look at our customer base, right? I mean, let's assume a Filipino customer using online from here to send money to Philippines, obviously, uses that channel. But in the U.S., as you know, there are many ethnic groups, many migrants, many customer from different ethnic groups. And we do give them the availability to use different things. So in the U.S., for instance, I'm sending from my online account from my iPhone to my father, Turkey, money, and it works pretty well. And my father in Turkey picks the money up. So I think it's really -- what I wanted to say is that from one point, you can serve 200 countries. You can serve one from westernunion.france (sic) [westernunion.fr] 200 countries. I think that's the huge advantage of Western Union.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thanks, James. Thanks, everyone, for joining us.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Scheirman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's third quarter results and then we'll take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2012 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We reconcile those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of the Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I will now turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. As we enter 2013, we continue to implement our plans to make pricing and other investment and undertake efficiency initiatives to better position our business for the future. Our focus this year has been on strengthening consumer money transfer, increasing customer and usage in business-to-business and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders.", "As we have now completed 3 quarters of the year, I remain pleased with the progress we are making. The third quarter results provided some very positive signs that our strategies are working.", "In consumer money transfer, transaction growth accelerated to 9% or 10% for the Western Union brand, driven by our pricing actions and strong electronic channels growth. In Business Solutions, revenue increased 10% in constant currency terms, as we continue to execute well on expanding product offerings and increasing penetration. And in consumer bill payment, increased 9% constant currency, driven by South America and the U.S. electronic bill pay business.", "The consumer money transfer pricing actions continue to produce strong results in transactions and usage. In the corridors where pricing actions had been implemented prior to the beginning of the third quarter, transactions increased 20%, or 14% excluding digital. In comparison, we're seeing brand transactions in the non-priced corridors increased 6%.", "Mexico, in particular, demonstrated more progress in recapturing momentum. Overall transactions, including Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, increased 15% in the country, while Western Union-branded transaction increased even 24%.", "In the U.S., we are very pleased to increase our distribution through our new relationship with Walgreens. Walgreens is the largest drugstore chain in the country with over 8,000 locations and we will be adding our consumer money transfer and bill payment services there beginning in 2014 providing more choice and convenience for consumers.", "In Europe, we renewed our agreement with our largest global agent, La Banque Postale, which has been offering our services in France for the last 17 years. And we extended our services to over 3,000 additional locations.", "Expanding electronic channels is also a major part of our strategy to increase choice and convenience and electronic channels once again delivered strong growth in the third quarter. Electronic channels revenue increased 24%, with C2C transaction through westernunion.com growing 68% and electronic account-based money transfer transactions increasing 55%.", "In addition to online banking access and westernunion.com, our money transfer services are available to approximately 115,000 ATMs around the world. Electronic channels remains our fastest-growing area and now represents 5% of total company revenue. They are also bringing us new consumers as we have consistently seen over 80% of our new westernunion.com customers being new to the franchise in the past 12 months.", "We have recently added to our capabilities by expanding our direct-to-bank services to China from various markets and extending our relationship with U.S. Bank to include mobile and money transfer services. We also signed new Mobile Money Transfer service agreements in Nigeria, Tunisia and Nepal and we released an enhanced version of westernunion.com mobile app, which has been received a good response.", "Turning to Western Union Business Solutions. Revenue increased 6% in the quarter or 10% in constant currency terms. I'm pleased with our business and sales execution and our global expansion and we are well positioned for long-term growth in business-to-business.", "Some of the recent initiatives in Business Solutions include the launch of options products in France and further global expansion of tuition payments for international students. We also continue to deliver on our third strategy initiative for 2013, which is to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for shareholders.", "Year-to-date through September, we generated $811 million of cash flow from operating activities and returned $543 million to shareholders. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow for the year and returning nearly $700 million to shareholders, representing around 7% of the current market capitalization.", "I also want to discuss the recent compliance and regulatory environment. As you are aware, regulatory requirements and expectations around financial service companies are escalating around the world. Some banks have recently faced large fines and some have announced billions of dollars of incremental investments in compliance areas.", "The environments continue to evolve. In the U.S., for example, we recently initiated agent procedures at our 50,000 agent locations to comply with the Dodd-Frank remittance transfer rule. And I am pleased to report that the procedure were implemented in time for the October 28 deadline.", "As we mentioned earlier this year, we have previously implemented new anti-money laundering and fraud prevention enhancements in countries such as Spain and U.K. And in the U.S., we are now working with our third monitor on the Southwest Border agreement. As noted in an 8-K filed today, we have agreed to an additional short-term extension to this agreement to continue discussing [indiscernible]. We could not conclude discussions on the [indiscernible] expansion under the previous time frame for reasons including the recent passing of Arizona's primary attorney on the matter.", "Overall, we have increased our investment in compliance significantly in recent years. A few months ago, we hired a new Chief Compliance Officer and he has brought on some highly experienced leaders to help us strengthen our compliance programs in the increasingly complex, demanding and very fast-changing global regulatory environment.", "Based on all these new and evolving requirements, our ongoing discussions and agreements with regulators around the world and our own reviews, we now anticipate significant additional investment in 2014, including adding more resources and new technology. We believe the compliance actions we are taking are the right ones for the long-term health of the company and we are very well positioned to adjust to this new environment.", "Although it is too early to establish a full 2014 financial outlook, we are pleased with the momentum of the business and we continue to expect revenue growth next year. However, due to recent change in both the expected incremental compliance expenses as well as the potential business impact from new compliance procedures, we do not expect growth in operating profit in 2014 at this time.", "But we will undertake additional efficiency initiatives to optimize our overall cost structure over time. We plan to continue to work to our budgeting process and we will give you further color early next year when we report 2013 results.", "And this brings me back to this year. We have affirmed our financial outlook for 2013, including narrowing our earnings per share outlook to higher end of the previous range and increasing our anticipated cash flow from operating activities to approximately $1 billion.", "Overall, our consumer money transfer strategies are delivering the desired results. In fact, in the third quarter, we produced the highest quarterly transaction growth rate in 3 years. Business Solutions is executing well and growing its business and cash flow generation remains strong. I'm pleased with the progress we are making and I remain confident in our business positioning and long-term opportunities.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we are making this year and we are affirming our full year financial outlook for 2013.", "Third quarter total consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion declined 1% compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the previously implemented pricing investments in the C2C business. On a constant currency basis, revenue was flat in the quarter.", "Key drivers in the quarter included strong growth in our electronic channels and from both Business Solutions and consumer bill payments. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue declined 2%, or 1% constant currency, as transaction growth was offset by the impact of previously implemented price reductions in certain corridors.", "Total transaction growth accelerated to 9% in the third quarter compared to 3% in the second quarter. Western Union-branded transactions increased 10% compared to 7% last quarter.", "The third quarter growth rate improvement compared to the second quarter was driven by continued acceleration from the pricing investments and increased growth in corridors where pricing investments were not made. Total company transaction growth is still being impacted by previous implemented compliance enhancements in some countries as we discussed earlier in the year.", "C2C cross-border principal increased 8% in the quarter and Western Union-branded cross-border principal increased 9%, with no impact from currency. Principal per transaction declined 1%. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was 11 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 8% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 2%.", "Turning to the regions. All of the geographic regions delivered improved transaction growth rates relative to the second quarter. In the Europe and CIS region, C2C revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, including a positive 2% impact from currency. Transactions in the region increased 7%, driven by success of the pricing actions and led by growth in key markets such as Germany, France and the U.K.", "North America revenue declined 7% from the prior year due primarily to price reductions, while transactions increased 5%. As Hikmet mentioned, we're making significant progress in Mexico and we continue to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de Mexico data available through August, which show the market growing transactions at mid-single digits in the first 2 months of the quarter. Our Mexico transactions increased 15% in the quarter and Western Union-branded transactions increased 24%.", "Mexico revenue, including Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, declined 10%, while revenue declined 12% for the Western Union brand. In the middle of the quarter, we reached the anniversary of the Vigo and Orlandi Valuta compliance-related changes implemented last year, which also aided our growth rate compared to previous quarters.", "Turning to the U.S. domestic money transfer. Revenue was down 1% in the third quarter on transaction growth of 6%. Lower principal bands and domestic money transfer continue to perform well, but these were offset by declines in higher principal transactions. Revenue in the Middle East and Africa region increased 1% compared with the year-ago quarter, with no impact from currency, and transactions grew 10% in the quarter. Transactions from the Gulf states are delivering strong growth and our pricing actions from Europe to Africa continue to gain traction.", "Asia Pacific region revenue declined 3% in the quarter, including a negative 2% impact from currency translation, while transaction growth in the region accelerated to 10%. Both the Philippines and India contributed to the strong growth, with India aided by both pricing initiatives and the depreciation of the Indian rupee.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue was down 3% from the prior-year period, including a negative 8% impact from currency, while transactions increased 4%. Constant currency revenue in the region was positively impacted by geographic and product mix.", "Turning to our digital business. westernunion.com delivered strong results in the quarter, with Money Transfer transaction growth of 68% and a revenue increase of 24% in the quarter. U.S.-originated online transactions increased 70% in the quarter.", "As Hikmet mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our digital channel performance. Total electronic channel revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile increased 24% in the quarter. Electronic account-based money transfers through banks revenue increased 29% and we now have over 75 banks launched with account-based money transfer services.", "Moving to the Consumer-to-Business segment. Revenue increased 3% in the quarter or 9% in constant currency terms. The U.S. electronic and the South American businesses continue to grow, partially offset by declines in the U.S. cash walk-in business.", "Business Solutions performed well as revenue increased 10% on a constant currency basis or 6% reported. Strong performance in Asia Pacific and the U.K. led the growth.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The third quarter GAAP operating margin was 21.0% compared to 25.7% in the prior-year period. As expected, the margin decline was primarily the result of pricing-driven revenue declines and other strategic investments, lower compensation expense in the third quarter last year and higher compliance costs. There were approximately $6 million of expenses related to the cost savings initiatives in the quarter.", "EBITDA margin was 25.8% compared to 30.0% a year ago. Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.39 compared to $0.45 in the prior year.", "The C2C operating segment margin was 24.0% compared to 29.4% in the prior-year period, with the decline primarily driven by the same factors as overall company margins.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 19.2% compared to 25.3% in the prior-year period. The margin benefited from higher revenue compared to the prior year, which was offset by higher bank fees, the pass-through to billers of Durbin-related debit card savings and IT investments.", "Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $3 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $7 million during the same period last year. The reduction in operating loss was primarily due to revenue growth and lower Travelex integration expense, partially offset by increased other operating expenses.", "The third quarter's $3 million loss included $16 million of depreciation and amortization and $4 million of Travelex integration expense. In the third quarter of last year, depreciation and amortization was $17 million, while integration expense was $10 million.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $811 million. Capital expenditures were $59 million in the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $4 billion and cash of $1.7 billion. Approximately 50% of the cash was held by United States entities.", "During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 1 million shares at an average price of $17.89, totaling $20 million. In addition, we paid $69 million in dividends. As of quarter end, we have 552 million shares outstanding and nearly $60 million remaining under our repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2013. We continue to project 2013 repurchases and dividends to total approximately $700 million this year, including approximately $400 million of share repurchases.", "At this time, we believe 2014 share repurchases may be minimal as we want to maintain a solid investment-grade credit ratings and we anticipate near-term limitations on available U.S. cash. Like many U.S. multinational companies, the majority of our cash flow is outside the country.", "Generally, we expect approximately 75% of our annual cash flow to be outside the U.S. And as you know, dividends, share repurchases and domestic capital expenditures, must be funded by U.S. cash. There may be some additional debt capacity under our desired investment-grade credit ratings and we're continuing to evaluate alternatives to make international cash available in the U.S.", "Turning back to this year. We are affirming the 2013 full year financial outlook that we provided in July, with the EPS outlook narrowed to the high end of the previous range. We now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $1.38 to $1.43 compared to $1.33 to $1.43 previously. The EBITDA margin outlook increased from 24.5% to 25.0%.", "We have also increased the operating cash flow outlook for 2013 to $1 billion to reflect the timing of certain tax payments to the IRS. The previous outlook was approximately $900 million, which included $100 million of final tax payments related to the agreement with the IRS announced in December of 2011. These payments are now expected to be paid in 2014 and beyond.", "To recap the quarter, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year. Consumer money transfer transaction trends are improving, electronic channels are growing strong and Business Solutions and consumer bill payments are delivering good growth.", "Laura, we are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess I want to ask just on the compliance side, just maybe the business impacts from some of these compliance procedures. I get the extra -- the spend that you alluded to here. But I know that influenced some of the agent loss in Mexico, perhaps last time. Can you comment on that broadly?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. If you look at -- it has a beauty doing business in 200 countries but it has also its price. Environment is very fast, very evolving. We upgrade some of the point of sale actions, we do it. We do have realtime risk assessment on the point of sale. We do have high principal callback, customer callbacks on the point of sale. And we do also increasingly putting more measurements on the point of sale. So that has -- that may have some revenue impact and some customer behavior impact. But generally, what happens is that we did that in the past in a few other countries. Generally, the customer behavior then changed back again, the customer use us again. So I believe that the revenue impact will be somehow but not that much. I mean, more on the investment side for the long term, I believe, will benefit Western Union. Not on a short -- short term maybe a little bit, some revenue impact, but not long term.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Hikmet, I know you're very -- go ahead, sorry.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "And I think it's important to note, even though there may be some impact to revenue because of compliance, in 2014, we still expect to grow revenues.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Absolutely, yes.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood. Understood. I mean, Hikmet, I know you're really close to the agents. You're always flying around meeting with them. What do you think their -- what's been their feedback with some of these compliance changes as they're going on?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Tien-tsin, as you know, 75% of our network are banks and financial institutions. So they live with that day to day. They know it, how it works. And they will implement that, which is good obviously. They also -- that's why they choose us because we have high standards on compliance, the banks. And it's nothing new on the financial institution area, on the compliance changing environment. I mean, we are not alone here, right? So the industry, totally, are investing a lot, millions of, billions of dollars. Our agents do that. So I think it's not something new to them. However, some independent agents could be having some new procedures. We have to implement, we have to take them to the -- some compliance trainings. And some nonperforming and noncomplying agents, we do close them, like we did it a year ago with 7,000 locations in the Southwest border area. However, generally, I would say that 75% of our agents are financial institutions, they live with that.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. That's helpful. I totally appreciate the compliance stuff. Last one, I promise. Just a -- Scott, you said U.S. cash, did you give how much of that was at the end of the quarter?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, there's about 50% of that is U.S. cash, about 50% is international.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess my question is with regards to the compliance costs. Is this a sort of a compliance costs surge, so to speak, for a year? Or is this a new normal?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, if you look at the compliance cost, Ashwin, this year, it's about 2.5% of our revenue. And at this time -- and we are looking at that with our compliance and this is so fast-changing, the environment. It's -- at this time, we are seeing about 3.5% to 4.5% of our revenue as an investment for 2014. And that investment will upgrade our compliance procedures. And the part of that is more resource, part of that is technology, investing on the technology. Obviously, as we speak, my team and I am working very close to find to optimize the procedure, look the best investment to upgrade our compliance environment. And so you can take next year about 3.5% to 4.5% of our revenue as an investment for '14. Right, Scott? That's the number.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes. And we'll continue to look for ways to optimize those costs, but those are generally infrastructure-type costs with people and technology and so forth. But over time, we'll look to optimize those costs. But it's important to us to have very strong compliance programs and that's what we're striving for.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. And over time, also, I believe that we will optimize them, Ashwin, because think about our span, our global reach, I think we do have quite good operation efficiency. Don't forget about 35% of our costs are fixed and 65% are variable. I believe that that's -- that will be more optimized. But we have to do these investments now.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And is the bulk of this compliance cost still focused in the U.S.? Which countries are the primary focus here?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, if you look at that, it's a global investment. It's not only U.S., right? So I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we did some investment -- new change requirements in U.K., Spain. We have some changes in European Union. We work with the Turk monitor in the Southwest Border area in the U.S. and U.S. is also part of it. We do -- we just expanded on a short-term also our Southwest Border agreement because of the passing of the Attorney General, which happened recently. So I think all this changing environment globally, it's a global trend, which is happening and very fast-growing. And I said to you before, it's nice to be in 200 countries. It's very good. It helps you as it grows. But it has also its price to be in 200 countries and the very change, fast-growing environment.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. My last question with regards to the buyback, which I don't fully understand the comment around minimal buyback because you are generating cash. You said 50% of the cash is in the U.S. So could you put a number on that? When you say minimal, what is minimal? Is it a couple hundred million dollars? Is it almost...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, it's early in the planning process right now. So it's going to be much less than the $400 million that we're targeting for this year. And probably -- an important point is that 75% of our cash flows, roughly our $1 billion cash flows, are international cash flows. And then we also have a goal to keep our desired investment-grade credit rating. So with all those things, it does provide some limitations for 2014 with buyback. But there could be some modest debt capacity there, too.", "Hikmet Ersek", "But one thing I just want to say also, Scott and I are constantly talking and looking at the opportunities, how we optimize our cash flow to -- for the shareholders, and we are constantly talking to the board about that.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Listen, would you mind starting off just for the recent traction we've been seeing in the pricing? And then obviously, flowing through over the next couple of quarters, I mean, should we continue to see an acceleration there? I know that the focus right now of investors is obviously on '14, the cost for compliance. But just curious how much of a top line strength we can expect to see given the pricing changes you've already made? And then what maybe we should be thinking about going forward in terms of additional price action, if there's even any necessary?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So I think -- Darrin, hi. I think generally, I'm very pleased with our C2C transaction growth. As you know, as I mentioned earlier, it was the strongest quarter we had the last 3 years. So we -- the team and I are very proud of that. And the pricing actions indeed are working on the field. We have -- I mean, our Western Union-branded transaction in Mexico, just to give an example, are going by 24%. And with Vigo and Orlandi Valuta, together we are, in Mexico, going 14%. And transaction growth is, on the price corridor totally is, Scott, about...", "Scott T. Scheirman", "20%.", "Hikmet Ersek", "20%. So it's really working. And the good news is, also, pricing is not all about it, Darrin. We are growing by 6% in the non-priced corridors. As you recall, we did about 25%, 75% of our business growth. So long term, I believe it's not all about price. We are very well positioned. We have a good brand. The agents are motivated about that. I don't see any big corrections we did like due to some compliance Mexico issues last year. I believe that we are very well positioned and it's all the package. It's not only pricing what we are doing...", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. That's good. So with regard -- I mean, you're seeing a lot of good traction on the price changes. Does that mean that some of the restructuring charges put aside -- again, put aside the compliance side, but the restructuring charges you put into effect this year, I guess we were wondering if you're going to see similar levels next year. Or is that going to sort of lighten up?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Well, Darrin, I'd say it's too early to talk about specifics about 2014. We do expect to grow the revenue. We are looking hard at all of our costs to optimize them and so forth. So we're very focused on that. But the cost savings initiatives we undertook this year, we do expect to see those benefits in 2014.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think if you, Darrin, being very frank and open here, if you put the compliance cost investment to side, we would have grown those profit growth, right? I mean, we -- don't forget, it's a very profitable company. I mean, we have -- compared with the competition and everything, we have really good margins. But that investment is needed. We are going to do that. And from today's point of view, we are looking for profit -- nonprofit growth. But we are very focused to optimize that and we will give you more color when we talk about in February, right?", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just this last question for me on the electronic channels. I mean, the transaction growth is still 68%. So I mean, in terms of investment dollars being made there, obviously, that was a big effort for you guys and it's obviously showing some big transaction numbers. Should we expect similar growth rate there, I mean, as some of the pricing initiatives had -- are starting to really kick in, as well as the strategic and marketing initiatives around that, is that -- should that continue? It's now 5%, I think, you said of your revenues in terms of electronic transactions now?", "Hikmet Ersek", "You talk about revenues, Darrin?", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, I was saying that the electronic channels now have gotten to about 5%, which, obviously, is a pretty significant step up.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Right. So no, I think -- I'm very pleased with the electronic channel. One of the big batch we did, as you know, 18 months, 20 months ago, we opened our San Francisco office. westernunion.com is growing, 68%, even the U.S.-generated transactions are going over 70%. And so U.S. is growing. The European Union transactions, I'm very pleased. And the other thing I'm very pleased, also, are the electronic account-based money transfer. Like, you go to your bank account and you send money electronically. That's going by 55%. So it's 5% of our revenue. And as you know, in westernunion.com, we have a road map for 2015 approximately being about $500 million revenue. And so I think that the team and I am pleased with that progress. And I have to say that's compliments to the San Francisco team.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions, one on the compliance and one on sort of the '14. So as you grow the business-to-business, is there anything you're dealing with compliance right now that is addressing that operation? Is it a very different compliance environment? Just want to make sure that as that grows, that the experience you're having right now of compliance around consumer isn't something that necessarily will be repeated by the business-to-business as that becomes a larger division in the years to come.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think if you look at, Tim, on our business, generally, we're seeing obviously every transaction cross-border and also intra-money transfer, we are very complied with the regulators. It's a very changing and fast-changing part. And business-to-business is a part of our business, which are also on the compliance umbrella. However, different business environment has different procedures. At the business-to-business, you open an account, you register and on the both sides. So we have different know-your-customer environment on the business-to-business than on the retail money transfer. On the account money transfer like electronic money transfer on westernunion.com or account-based money transfer, we have different procedure like we have in the retail money transfer business. So it's different -- on the operation side, it's different procedure. But I would say, overall, we are all under one umbrella on the Western Union compliance programs. And that's why we also invest in the compliance programs in the B2B.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes. And Tim, this is part of the increase for 2014. So Business Solutions is listed in that. And as we mentioned last time, Business Solutions is part of the Southwest Border agreement now as well.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, it's not an extra investment there needed.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 2 other real quick ones. Scott, regarding the comments about operating profit for '14, I just want to make sure I understand the semantics of that, GAAP basis to GAAP basis like '13 GAAP to '14 GAAP, basically you're looking for flat?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, the comment -- it is a GAAP basis and our comments were that we don't expect operating profit to grow in 2014. Again, it is preliminary. We're working through the budgeting process. But with the increased compliance costs and some of the impact that may have on the revenue, we don't see operating profits growing in 2014.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last one and I'll hop off. Just going back to westernunion.com, I know you guys have been working to enhance, I think, the ACH funding capabilities versus currently, I think you're a lot of credit and debit card. Just sort of curious if you could give us an update where you're at around those efforts and what that might mean in terms of the profitability enhancements or a westernunion.com as a stand-alone?", "Hikmet Ersek", "As you know, at the westernunion.com, we are in 23 countries now. I think we are expanding and I'm very -- we will expand in more countries even within the next few months. So I'm very, very optimistic. It depends on the ACH where -- which country you are and where you are. In the U.S., we do have today on the credit card. And on ACH, also we do ACH. And for instance, in India, we do have ACH. It drops 3, 4 days later on the account of the Indian account. We do have direct debit in Germany. We have direct debit in Austria. We have direct debit in France. We do have this kind of direct debit as a kind of ACH where we have it in Europe [indiscernible] and EPS payment in Europe. So it depends really on the customer choice. And I see that the customers are using credit card or direct-to-bank. That's really their choice.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Merrill Lynch.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is David Chu for Sara Gubins. Just wondering, amongst -- so you noted that you closed noncompliance agents. The agent base was down 5,000 sequentially. Was that -- to account for this, was there compliance issues at these agents?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I would say generally, I'm very pleased with our agents new acquisitions and expansion. Don't forget, we just signed Walgreens. La Banque Postale, additional 13 -- additional 3,000 locations in France. So additional, we are -- I'm very pleased. And we are very focused on the productive locations. The closures, we do that every year. The closure of the nonproductive location is a part of our business. We do not -- we go and close the nonproductive locations, right? And we are very focused on the productive locations. And could be also part -- some parts of them are not complying with our systems. But I would not see that as a majority of our closure. It's more about nonproductive locations that we close.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, most of the reductions we did in the quarter were really dormant locations in India and Europe. Some of those may have been related to compliance needs, but they're almost all dormant locations.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, they are dormant.", "David Chu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And so your trends have improved nicely and competitors have seen strong trends as well. I mean, is there anything you can point to you from a macro or secular perspective that possibly is increasing demand here?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I think I'm very pleased, general overall transaction growth. I'm not sure if everyone is so pleased that I am pleased overall in global if you're in 200 countries. I think -- let me get Mexico, I believe the question on the Mexico. We did have better transaction growth than the Mexico -- Banco de Mexico that announced and I think I'm pleased with our Mexico business here. But I will say that generally, there has been some in Europe, some better environment, global economic environment. Our business in Europe, Italy has been improving. In Southern Europe, Spain, I see improvement. And I do see our Germany and France and U.K. businesses always been good and supporting our part. Asia has been performing well, Scott, right?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And what else? I think also Africa, Middle East are delivering good numbers. Generally, there is a more positive environment 3 quarters, 2, 3 quarters ago. Now it's -- I see a better economic environment. And also, agents are telling us that.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, I'd just add that the team is executing well. So when you look at each of the regions, third quarter compared to second quarter, had better transaction growth. The things that we've done to improve the consumer value proposition, those transactions grew 20% in the Western Union price corridors. But even the corregidors where we're not doing pricing were up 6%. And we talked a lot on this call about digital and account-based money transfer, but it's all those things that we're putting together to give the consumer choice and convenience. And the team is just executing well in the field.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just more questions about the compliance cost. Did competitors have these additional compliance costs as well?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I can't make comment on the competitors. But we believe that's industry standard, what we are setting here, and we are really following the regulatory requirements. And we are looking at our compliance environment and we are investing on that. As a market leader, I assume that, that will be industry standard. We are not doing more than the -- I don't think that long term, we will do additional -- we serve the customer, we serve the shareholder. I think that's all about protecting the customer, Bryan. I mean, I believe that setting the industry standard, some others will also have the same standards.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Well, I assume there's -- you're creating a mode around the business because it's going to cost significant amount of money to transfer money internationally if you have to put this kind of money into compliance. Or is this just specific to Western Union?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's not specific to Western Union, Bryan. I think it's the general environment. As you know, we operate in 16,000 corridors. Every corridors, every country has their own dynamics. I believe that we really look at -- that it's about -- it was 2.5% of our revenue. Now it's going to be about 3.5% to 4.5%. I'm really looking that we have the right investment, right environment to comply with the rules. And I believe it's going to be competitive advantage long-term for Western Union and we are doing the right thing here.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "How much of the 2.5% -- or 3.5% to 4.5% of the revenue in 2014 is a onetime investment? Because it sounds like there's some onetime investments to upgrade the systems?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's too early to say, Scott, right? I mean, that's -- as we speak and why we're changing so fast, Bryan, as we speak these numbers, we are really looking at the numbers. We are -- it's too early to tell about that. But I believe a part of it is onetime, right, Scott?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Bryan, that's where we're digging through right now. So some of that could be onetime. There could be some opportunities through automation. But a fair amount of it, too, is infrastructure. But as Hikmet mentioned, it's preliminary and we're working through that. But our goal is to really meet the regulatory requirements. And we do believe, as the market leader, these will and are becoming industry standards that we believe everybody is going to abide by.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "We had calculated about $80 million of op income improvement from less integration and cost saving benefits into fiscal year '14. Why doesn't that offset these incremental additional costs, or they do? Because then the question is, if you're going to get revenue growth, as you guys always say, profit growth -- higher revenue growth will lead to higher profit growth?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, first, I'd say, Bryan, it's early in the process. We're working through our budgeting and we'll give you more color in February. But just to add a few comments there that as we think about revenue, we do expect revenue to grow in 2014. We also believe the compliance initiatives will have some impact on our customers and revenue from that standpoint. And then we've also talked throughout the year about increased agent commissions. So we do believe our agent commissions will continue to increase on a near-term basis. That's improved our competitive positions in certain markets for sure. Longer term, we see opportunities to optimize our distribution costs. And then clearly, we are making some investments in Dot.com, in IT. Especially Dot.com, we think it's really the right thing because, as Hikmet mentioned earlier on the call, this we suspect and we believe will be a $0.5 billion business by 2015. So we will give you more color in February as we move forward.", "Hikmet Ersek", "But Bryan, look, it's early to tell. And we are looking at, I think, the same calculation, we do also have it. I think you are -- and we are looking at that to optimize our costs and investments here.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, just seems like you have some onetime integration costs plus cost saves benefits, which can offset these additional costs. So and if you do get any revenue growth, it just feels like there should be some profit growth.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from James Friedman of SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Also on the compliance costs. I was just wondering, are those compliance costs uniform across the organization? For example, do you notice better compliance aptitude for wu.com than for the physical point of sale?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think the compliance costs are, overall, the same in some westernunion.com. We do have some advantages where you register -- to register the customer, know your customer, procedure is easier. If I understand your question right, in some retail money transfer, we need additional point of sale requirements at that moment, ask for additional information. I think it's the know-your-customer and know-your-agent requirements from the regulatory is getting high, more and more. That's why we are investing. But generally, I would say once the customer is registered, know-your-customer procedure is done and we know the customer and the regulators are asking us different way of questions and procedures than we are doing today.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. There were some increased compliance requirements from the CFPB, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, announced this morning. Were those a subset of what it is that you're talking about relative to your plans for next year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think -- I don't know. I'm not aware about that. I have to look at that what you're mentioning now. But I have to say that from CFPB announced remittance rules, our Dodd-Frank rules is more transparency of the consumers; that on the forms, we put more information and we disclose more foreign exchange rates and fees to the consumers. And we do that. And I have to say that I'm very proud of my team and we did that in 50,000 locations on time. And I believe that's the thing you're -- I don't know if you are talking about that, but I'm not aware about new rules announced this morning from CFPB. I have to come back to you on that.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Yes, no, I think that, that was it, Hikmet. Last one for me. And I apologize, I think that you had addressed this earlier, it's more of a housekeeping question. But you did have a 5,000 estimate reduction. What was that due to in terms of franchisees sequentially in the quarter?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, year-over-year, we do that, look at our location count. And we do have a closure and cleanup. And we did close 5,000 locations, which were dormant, right? I mean, we are about 500,000 locations. We have about 515,000 locations, 115,000 ATMs. So almost 650,000 touch point. But these are the cleanup, we do it. But I don't see any big changes on our expansion on locations.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Tom McCrohan of Janney.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Sorry to beat a dead horse on compliance. How much of this is related to the remittance transfer rules? That came out of Dodd-Frank. That's not part of the CFPB. Do you have a majority of what the spending is all about?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. I can tell you -- I mean, the general spending is mainly in the U.S. and on upgrading the point of sale in the European Union with the new rules. We have it in the European Union and which has been -- it's part of it is also been announced earlier, which we are going to implement in '14, right? So I think that the rule -- all over the -- if you are acting in 200 countries, you do have -- I speak to the regulators in Russia, I speak to the regulators in Morocco, I speak to the regulators in Brazil or in the U.S. So it's generally all over, an upgrade of regulatory environment. And very fast-changing regulatory environment actually. And many regulators, we have to implement that.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, the U.S. remittance money transfer rules, they've been implemented. So we have a deadline of, actually, Monday of this week. So that's in place now. So in terms of the increment in cost next year, not a lot is necessarily coming from that. But as Hikmet said, it's really coming from a lot of different things that we're doing around know-your-customer and know-your-agent around the world in Europe and the U.S., part of the Southwest Border, Asia as well.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "It's not one particular regulator that's driving you? That's a whole bunch of...", "Michael A. Salop", "No, no, it's a variety of things.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's the European Union, it's the U.S., it's the Latin American -- that's the -- as I said, there's beauty to be in 200 countries, but there's also some investment, price to do business in 200 countries. That's a part of it.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "So barriers to entry is going up. It's getting more difficult to compete in this business unless you have a real long-term commitment. That's good for you guys, but there's no profit growth next year. And I guess people just want to know what the long-term earnings power is. And when you come out of this at the other end, what should people be thinking about in terms of long-term sustainable transaction growth and market share gains? If you can talk about that, that will be helpful.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. Well, first of all, I'm going to give more color in February about '14. But I -- good news is that we have a momentum, right? I mean, we have a momentum. The transactions growth are good. The revenue growth is coming. And I think I feel comfortable despite all these investments and despite all these changing environment, we do generate revenue growth next year. And obviously, also transaction growth. So I believe that we have the right fundamentals. Then the other thing is that electronic channels are growing very fast. I think our retail money transfer business is doing well. I think the compliance thing is here. It's a part of doing business. But it doesn't apply on us. It applies on others. The other thing I may also -- if you look at Mexico, for instance, our Mexico business is doing well. The part of it is that we're capturing market share from some banks who are not doing this business anymore and we are capturing. So I think we have room to grow this business in the environment which is complex. And I see compliance as a competitive advantage and a competence for us to capture market share from financial institutions they can't invest -- they don't want to do this business anymore.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "So last question, this is just -- it's just that I feel intuitive that -- when it feels intuitive is that the barriers to entry going up and it's costing a lot more to be in this game, to transfer money around. There seems like every week we read about a new company that's offering a P2P service. Square just came out with a service as well. So how are you thinking about the threats from these emerging players? Are they -- how are they going to -- just how you're thinking about these emerging players that keep showing up in the press and that I think all of us are getting questions on?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, the last 3 years since I've been CEO, that was more press releases than real revenue-generating. I would say there are always press releases. But I -- in the cross-border, we use our competency. I have not seen a big movement on that. It's a complex business. You have to build it. You have to invest in the regulatory environment. You have to build the customer trust. You have to cross the currency. You have to settle in 123 currencies. You have to get this risk management with agents. You have to buy 500,000 locations. It's a complex business. I did not see any movements from competition there. The announcements I have seen so far was more on the intra-money transfer business, was more of press releases than real revenue-generating activities.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, I think you also see a lot of dollar limitations on some of these products as well. So they're small dollar transfers in many cases. They put limitations around their own business.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from David Togut of Evercore Partners.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Looking at your C2C revenue growth and transaction growth for the quarter, that implies pricing was down 10%. That was a larger cut than we were expecting for the third quarter given that most of your pricing cuts had been taken by the second quarter. So could you just discuss your pricing actions for the third quarter and then give us a preliminary view of your 2014 pricing strategy?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, for the third quarter, that was the first quarter that all of our pricing actions were put in place, if you will, so a full quarter impact of that. And what we did see was 10% transaction growth on the brand. Now mix had about a 2% impact as we move forward. As we think longer term about pricing is that in 2013, we did some significant pricing investments in certain corridors. Some of these were onetime resets. We don't expect to see that in '14 as we move forward. And I think it's also important to note, if you look at the third quarter, our cross-border principal on -- for the Western Union brand grew 9%. So that's a nice growth rate. Again, you can't look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But when you look at IAD (sic) [IDA] or the World Bank, they're projecting growth rates of 6% kind of on a full-year basis. But it speaks to that we are in a healthy industry and we're doing the right things to got ourselves very well positioned in a healthy industry.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I think you disclosed you had $4 million in Travelex integration expenses in the quarter, but I might have missed how much restructuring in terms of the cost savings restructuring that you booked in the quarter. And I wanted to see if the full year totals of $20 million on the Travelex side and $45 million on the cost takeout side are still valid.", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, in simple terms that we're projecting will be about $20 million of Travelex integration. And then on the other cost-savings initiative, for the quarter, that was about $6 million. And we think for the full year will be somewhere between spending $40 million to $45 million, which is broadly consistent with what we've talked about in prior quarters, Jason.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So that's a pretty big step up in Q4, right?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess if operating profit isn't going to increase next year, there's no reason to assume EPS will either, I suppose, just given that you indicated buybacks will be relatively minimal next year. Is there anything else in there that we'd be missing?", "Scott T. Scheirman", "Yes, the only color I would give you is it's early. And broadly, EPS will probably broadly track with not having -- likely, we don't expect to have operating profit growth. So the operating profit will probably move in tandem with EPS, or EPS in tandem with operating profit, just from a big picture standpoint. But it is early.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And then just lastly, to finish the discussion on compliance. I mean, it sounds like what you guys are saying if you kind of roll up all this commentary is that it's, essentially, going to cost you more than you previously thought to comply with regulations that you already knew about. I mean, is that a fair way to kind of summarize it as opposed to new regulations having just popped up in the last couple of months since the last earnings call that you're all of a sudden reacting to? I mean, is that fair?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No -- well, I would say that there is no question that this has been always in our target. We recently hired the Chief Compliance Officer. He brought a very experienced team. We look at our programs and some parts of that are coming new. It's sudden changes. Some parts of that, we have to implement the rules that we have it in place. So I think it's a mixture of all and that requires additional investment about 1% that we did it in 2013. So but it's still too early. It's still we are looking at it. We are optimizing at that. And it is that we have to do it. It has been -- we were thinking about 2.5%, 3.5%. Now it's about, looking at the programs and fast-changing thing, it's about 3.5% to 4.5% investment we are thinking about. So it's something that we are looking at very carefully.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes. And just a lot of these things are not necessarily black and white. They haven't been historically. So when we work with regulators around the world and around the states and you get clarification on what's needed and make agreement on what programs you'll do, these things are kind of fluid. And so some of these are interpretations of older rules. Some of these are new things. Some of these are just clarifications with the regulators. Some of them are our own review. So there's a lot of different things going in here.", "Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us, and have a good afternoon.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's fourth quarter results and 2014 outlook, and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found on westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab, and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2012 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of the Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, our 2013 results were consistent with our expectations entering the year, and we made good progress executing the key strategic initiatives we began in late 2012.", "As you recall, our plan included making pricing and other strategic investments and undertaking cost initiatives to better position our business for the future. We also continued increasing our compliance investments, including hiring a new Chief Compliance Officer and other senior compliance leaders last year to better navigate the evolving and complex global environment.", "From a financial perspective, we were able to deliver earnings per share of $1.43, which was at the higher end of our outlook range entering the year. Our key strategies in 2013 were: Focus on strengthening our consumer money transfer business and our business-to-business foundation, while at the same time, continuing to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders.", "We believe we made good progress in each of these areas. In Consumer Money transfer, our pricing investments delivered the transaction growth we expected, and we further advanced our capabilities in electronic channels. The pricing and other strategic actions were initiated in Consumer Money Transfer were intended to increase consumer usage, driven by better value propositions and more choice of channel options.", "Our transaction growth trends at the end of 2013 represented strong improvements from the beginning of the year and this gives us good momentum heading into 2014.", "In the fourth quarter, Consumer Money Transfer transactions grew 9%. Transactions increased 20% in the quarter in corridors where pricing had been implemented, or 15%, excluding westernunion.com.", "The turnaround in Mexico continued. As we benefited from pricing investment, bigger growth and capturing more of the business previously moving through banks. Mexico delivered 20% transaction growth in the quarter, far outperforming the market data, as reported by Banco de Mexico.", "Electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer and mobile, increased 32% in the quarter. The westernunion.com C2C revenue growth rate accelerated to 34% on 64% transaction growth, while the revenue from account-based money transfer through banks increased 33% on transaction growth of 63%.", "During the year, we introduced improved platforms on more direct-to-bank capabilities for westernunion.com. We now have Western Union branded transaction sites in 24 countries, from which consumers can send to 200 countries and territories around the world.", "In Business Solutions, we achieved 8% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, or 12% constant currency. For the full year, revenue increased 7%, or 9% in constant exchange rates, with sequential improvement during the year. We feel we are exiting the year with good momentum in business solutions and a strong sales-oriented team on the grounds to drive growth going forward.", "Our third key focus area in 2013 was to generate and deploy strong cash flow. Despite being an investment year, we generated over $1 billion of cash flow from operations and returned over $670 million to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases.", "Now turning to 2014. We plan to continue to focus on the same key strategic areas: Strengthening consumer money transfer with an emphasis on digital; driving accelerated growth in Business Solutions; and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders.", "In Consumer Money Transfer, we want to drive profitable growth through expanding electronic based channels, optimizing the performance of our distribution network and strengthening customer relationships, while also continuing to enhance compliance capabilities.", "We expect westernunion.com's C2C revenue growth to accelerate from last year's 24% rate, as we enhance our capabilities around products, pay in and pay out choices and risk management, to bring new customers and increased conversion rates.", "We will also look to open new market, as well as add more online banking relationships for account-based money transfer. We continue to see primarily new customers online, with over 80% of new westernunion.com customer having not used our brand in the previous 12 months.", "Our distribution network, digital offerings, global brand and compliance infrastructure, position us well to connect the cash and digital worlds of our consumers, and we will continue to leverage our capabilities in the fast-growing digital segment of the money transfer market.", "We have an industry-leading network, with over 500,000 agent locations and over 100,000 ATMs that offer our money transfer services. We plan to add new retail locations and more account-based options in 2014, as they remain white space opportunities especially on the receive site and attractive parts of trade around the world. We are, however, also very focused on network productivity.", "We want to ensure our network is well aligned with changes in consumer movements and preferences. Also, as increased compliance requirements raise the cost of maintaining and monitoring locations, we want to add locations more selectively and prune dormant and nonprofitable ones where appropriate.", "In Business Solutions, we have worked through the challenges associated with the Travelex integration. And now we have the right foundation in place to accelerate growth moving forward. We are focused on sales effectiveness and new product development with an emphasis on increasing penetration in existing large markets. We will continue to differentiate ourselves by tailoring product solutions for specific customer markets and channels, including strong offerings for universities, financial institutions and non-profit organizations. We expect Business Solutions revenue to increase in the low double-digits in 2014. And we continue to believe this is a great long-term growth opportunity, driven by global trade and increased penetration.", "We also plan to continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders, while also seeking to maintain our investment grade credit rating. I'm very pleased that we have a new $500 million share repurchase authorization, and we expect to have a strong returns of funds to shareholders once again in 2014, through both our dividends, which is currently at $0.50 per share annually, and stock buyback.", "Our financial outlook for 2014 is in line with what we communicated in October. We expect low mid-single digit constant revenue growth. Profits will be impacted by increases in compliance spending and changes in procedures, as we discussed last year. Our compliance and project management teams have been working diligently over the last few months to prioritize requirements, analyze technology solutions, assess execution plans and redefine budgets.", "After our assessments, we believe compliance costs will total approximately 3.5% to 4% of revenue in 2014. We are taking other steps to optimize our overall cost structure. Therefore, we had additional expenses related to these initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "In 2013, our business trends improved throughout the year, as we continued our journey to restore growth momentum. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe we are in a strong position. Cross-border money transfer and business payments, fueled by global trade, are growing markets. And Western Union has great assets to help drive good, profitable growth over the long run.", "With our omni-channel strategy, we are very well-positioned to respond to the different needs of our global customers in 200 countries and territories. In 2014, we will remain focused on consumer money transfer, with an emphasis on digital development and business-to-business cross-border payments, while still targeting strong annual cash flow generation and deployment.", "Before turning the call over to Raj Agrawal, our Interim CFO, to give more detail on the fourth quarter results and 2014 outlook, I will like to take a moment and thank our outgoing CFO, Scott Scheirman. Scott has been a tremendous asset for me and the company for many years, and has left a strong financial foundation in place for us to build from. I know many of you, like me, appreciate Scott's leadership and integrity, and we want to wish him all the best.", "Raj Agrawal stepped into the Interim CFO role on January 1, after serving most recently as President of Western Union Business Solutions based in London. Raj has a strong financial and business background. He originally joined Western Union in 2006 as a treasurer and has held a variety of other financial roles with the company, including being my financial partner when I ran the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia regions. So Raj, welcome, and I give the call to you now.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Thank you, Hikmet, and I'm pleased to join you today. As I review the 2013 financial results, I will primarily focus on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.", "Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion was flat compared to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 1% in the quarter. Electronic channels and Business Solutions each delivered strong growth, but these increases were largely offset by the impact of the previously implemented pricing investments in C2C.", "In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue declined 1% and was flat on a constant currency basis. Our pricing actions are yielding strong results, as total transactions grew 9% in the quarter. Transactions increased 20% in the quarters where we implemented pricing actions, or 15%, excluding westernunion.com. In the non-priced corridors, total transactions increased 5%. C2C cross-border principal increased 8% in the quarter, with no impact in currency, while principal per transaction declined 2%.", "The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was 10 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 6% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 3%.", "Turning to the regions. All of the regions delivered good transaction growth rates in the fourth quarter. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency. Transactions in the region increased 7%, driven by continued growth in key markets, such as Germany, Italy, France and the U.K.", "North America revenue declined 2% in the quarter, while transactions increased 6%. As Hikmet mentioned, we delivered strong growth in Mexico, where we continue to grow faster than the market. Our Mexico transactions increased 20%, compared to 15% in the third quarter, while Mexico revenue was flat in the quarter. In the U.S., domestic money transfer revenue was flat on transaction growth of 5%, as growth in lower principal bands was offset by declines in higher principal transactions.", "Revenue in the Middle East Africa region was flat compared with the year ago quarter with no impact from currency, while transactions grew 8%. Asia Pacific region revenue declined 2%, including a negative 2% impact from currency translation. Transaction growth in the region improved to 11%, driven by strong growth in the Philippines and India.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue was down 4% from the prior year period, including a negative 8% impact from currency, while transactions increased 6%.", "In our Digital business, westernunion.com continued to report strong results in the quarter, with money transfer transaction growth of 64% and a revenue increase of 34% in the quarter. U.S. originated online transactions increased 61%. Total electronic channels revenue, which includes westernunion.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile increased 32% in the quarter, and represented 5% of total company revenue. Revenues from account-based money transfer banks through banks increased 33%, and we now have over 75 banks active with account-based service.", "In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 2% in the quarter, but increased 5% in constant currency terms. The U.S. electronic and the South America business continue to grow, partially offset by decline in the U.S. cash walk-in business.", "Business Solutions revenue accelerated 12% on a constant currency basis, or 8% reported. Strong performance in Canada and the U.K. and increased revenue from customer hedging activities contributed to the growth.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 16.8%, compared to 20.1% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily the result of the impact of pricing and other strategic investments, higher compliance expense and lower compensation expense in the prior year period, partially offset by lower marketing expense.", "In the fourth quarter, we incurred some additional cost savings expenses to drive future efficiencies. These initiatives included streamlining of our regional structures and integration of many of our new product initiatives into existing business units, as well as further optimization of our shared services support groups.", "Overall, for 2013, we incurred $57 million of expense on cost savings initiatives, including $33 million in the fourth quarter. We expect these initiatives to drive an incremental $45 million of cost savings in 2014. EBITDA margin was 21.3% in the quarter, compared to 24.4% a year ago.", "Our fourth quarter tax rate of 10.1% benefited from non-recurring items, and we would expect that 15% level from the first 9 months of the year to be more indicative of our ongoing rate. Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.31, compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. The C2C operating segment margin was 20.5%, compared to 25% in the prior year period, with the decline primarily driven by the same factors as overall company margins.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 15.6%, compared to 17% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily due to higher IT expense, bank fees driven by mix, and the pass-through to billers of Durbin-related debit card savings, which were partially offset by costs in the prior year quarter related to the renegotiation of a third-party distribution agreement.", "Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $11 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $18 million for the same period last year. The reduction in operating loss was driven by lower Travelex integration expenses and strong revenue growth, with partial offsets from expenses related to cost savings initiatives.", "The fourth quarter's $11 million loss included $13 million of depreciation and amortization and $5 million of Travelex integration expense. In the fourth quarter of last year, depreciation and amortization was $18 million, while integration expense was $12 million.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures were $75 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, capital spending was approximately 4% of revenues, which was in line with our outlook.", "At the end of the year, the company had debt of $4.2 billion and cash of $2.1 billion. Approximately 50% of the cash was held by United States entities. As a reminder, we have $500 million of maturing debt that we plan to pay out when due later this month.", "During the fourth quarter, we issued $250 million of 5.5 year notes at a coupon of 3.4%. In the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock at an average price of $16.79, totaling $59 million. In addition, we paid $69 million in dividends. At year-end, we have 549 million shares outstanding.", "Now before discussing the 2014 outlook, I want to give you a brief update on our Southwest Border agreement with the state of Arizona, regarding our anti-money laundering compliance programs. Last week, we filed an 8-K announcing an extension of the agreements through the end of 2017.", "We've been negotiating with the state for this extension, which gives us additional time to implement the many recommendations from the monitor and defines remedies for noncompliance. We believe we will be able to complete these requirements prior to the end of the extended term, and are pleased to have a defined process and final timeline now agreed.", "The extension is not a driver of the increase in compliance cost in 2014, as we have already been spending on the Southwest Border projects the last several years. And we accrued many of the expenses related to the extension in 2013.", "Turning to our outlook for 2014, our expectations are largely consistent with what we disclosed last October. Overall, we expect low to mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, driven by Digital, Business Solutions and Consumer Bill Payments, with some offset in C2C from the effective compliance procedure changes in various markets.", "Gas revenue is expected to be in the range of flat to low single-digit growth, as we anticipate negative currency impacts from the emerging market devaluations. Most of the emerging market economies are receive markets for Western Union, so there's not a significant currency exposure. However, markets like Argentina and Venezuela are primarily outbound send markets, so we are anticipating impact from devaluations. We have both Consumer Money Transfer and Bill Payments businesses in Argentina, which together represent around 4% of our company revenues. The currency has already devalued and economists are projecting further declines throughout the year, which is factored into our outlook. We expect the company's operating margins to be between 19% and 20%, which comprises -- which compares to 20% from 2013.", "Profit margin should benefit in 2014 from lower integration and cost initiative expenses and higher related savings. However, we anticipate these benefits will largely be offset by higher compliance costs, higher commission rates in retail C2C and further investments in digital and business solutions. We expect compliance-related expense to total approximately 3.5% to 4% of revenue in 2014. The compliance expense forecast is projected to be composed of approximately 50% people cost, with the remainder primarily split between technology and outside services.", "We anticipate our compliance-related personnel to increase to approximately 2,000 people by early 2015. Although it is still very early to project precise longer-term compliance costs and the environment can always change, our objective is for compliance, as a percentage of revenue, in 2015 to be a similar range in 2014.", "The expected increase in retail C2C commission rates in 2014 is being driven primarily by the renewals of some key strategic agents, as well as some new signings. We are still targeting lower distribution costs longer-term. We're both being on new agents and increasing the westernunion.com and account receipts portions of our business. We expect our tax rate in 2014 to be around 15%. Putting all this together, we project earnings per share for 2014 to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50.", "The outlook for 2014 cash flow from operating activities is approximately $900 million, or $1 billion, excluding anticipated final tax payments related to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service from 2011. The final $100 million of payments related to this agreement was previously projected to be paid last year, but we now expect this to occur during late 2014 or in 2015.", "The new $500 million repurchase authorization is in effect through mid-2015. We have identified working capital programs, which we believe will give us access to additional available cash this year, and we look to execute a majority of the authorization in 2014, depending on market conditions and other factors. So to summarize, although growth rates and profits are projected to be tempered by compliance changes and some negative currency movements, we do expect to return to solid constant currency revenue growth in 2014. Cash flow should remain healthy and we plan to continue with strong returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and buyback.", "So that is our current outlook for 2014. And operator, we are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the new compliance procedures. I guess, what's been the impact so far in the fourth quarter? Did you see an impact on transaction growth? And then, secondly, in the guidance. It sounds like you're expecting some type of impact on transaction growth. Just trying to figure out if that's 2 points, 4 points or how much of transaction growth are you expecting to be impacted by the increase in compliance costs?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We do see some impact on the compliance pressure, especially in the higher bands, Bryan. It does do impact our revenues. And we did a forecast also for 2014, some impact here. And in that impact, we believe it's mainly the higher bands and also, the transactions will be not -- the transaction number will be okay, I believe, but the revenue number will have some impact on the higher bands. And in our outlook, we did put that in and calculate in our procedures.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Bryan, let me just add to what Hikmet said. We do expect to see some negative impact on our revenue in 2014 from compliance procedures. And those are primarily impacts to our high principal transactions, high frequency senders and receivers, and sometimes, high-risk corridors. But we've factored in, into our outlook a negative, a 1 to 2 point negative impact in revenue for the year.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, now that's helpful. And then I might have missed it, but what are you guys expecting for pricing in 2014?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, it's again, it's also in our outlook. Generally, we don't assume that we're going to have a pricing, but we did it in last -- end of 2012 and beginning of 2013. So we believe that we're going to have the -- we don't see a big competitive reaction on our pricing. Our price corridors are working very well. And I believe that we have good momentum and gaining in main corridors, some main market share gain.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, so Bryan, we're trying to get away from giving pricing guidance so we can react however we need to, as we go through the year and just really try to drive revenue growth. But the pricing assumption is certainly a lot lower than what we did last year.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So that's -- the pricing impact will be less, I guess, and probably more to the typical range, I guess, of where we went previously?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, we still have to anniversary, the first half of the year, the pricings that we did last year, still see that in the numbers. But the pricing actions will be much lower than last year.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, and then just last question for me. We've been hearing some banks have been getting out of the remittance business due to some of these higher compliance costs. Just curious if you've seen any impact from that, or if you've heard of that so far?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, Bryan, we do see it. Some of the banks even are calling us and given the compliance environment, want to partner with us. I mean, one of the things we definitely see is that a part of our growth in Mexico corridor is that some banks are getting out of this business. And obviously, enhancing our compliance activities does help getting this revenue for us, because we do invest in the compliance, and that helps. But generally, don't forget that 75% of our network is international banks and financial institutions, and we do have a good relationship with them.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A lot of good detail here. Just, I guess, on the margin side. Just wanted to clarify. So it sounds like the compliance expenses, you're trimming the investment by 50 bps on the high end. Is that right? And then also, the $45 million in savings that you're talking about from some of the restructuring, how much of that is incremental savings versus 2013? Just trying to clear those 2 things up on margin first.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Tien-tsin, this is Raj. You're right, the compliance spend is 3.5% to 4%. So that is our expectation for the year. And then the -- the $45 million of savings is incremental to what we achieved in 2013. So that's an incremental savings in 2014.", "Michael A. Salop", "So Tien-tsin, you'll recall, last year, we were expecting an incremental $15 million of savings in 2014. We took some additional actions in the fourth quarter, and that impacted our fourth quarter margin. But we're driving additional savings on top of that 15. So the $45 million is incremental.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right, great. So $45 million is purely incremental, so that is new. So that's great. And then just, I guess, glad to hear the step-up in the buybacks through the working capital. I mean, is it -- should we assume that you could also take on some additional debt to hit that $500 million bogey? Are there some other options that you might want to consider as well? Or is it all coming from the working capital?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Tien-tsin, it'll primarily be coming from the working capital initiative. That's really just managing our intercompany payment flows more effectively, more efficiently. And I expect that we'll have more opportunities, longer-term in that area as well. Certainly, as the business grows, it will create more debt capacity as well. And we have, obviously, a lot of different funding needs in the business, not just share repurchase, but -- and so we're looking at all different options, and use the best vehicle available to us.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right, great. Glad to hear it. Last one, I promise. Just the growth in C2C transactions, where you did not adjust price, did I hear correctly, 5%? I think it was 6% the prior quarter, just trying to gauge how that came in versus your internal plan?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It was 5%. Yes, Tien-tsin.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, 5%. How does that compare versus plan, Hikmet?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we are very -- we have a good momentum. And that's why we -- I feel comfortable with the transactions growth. And especially, also -- even the non-priced corridors, we are very well-positioned. As you know, this business, Tien-tsin, it's corridor by corridor. And we do see a good growth corridor by corridor and in the major markets. So I am -- that's why it fit the growth rates.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Tien-tsin, the growth was also 5% last quarter, and it accelerated throughout the course of the year. So we're happy with where that's at.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just looking at the compliance costs for 2014, the 3.5% to 4.5%. Is any portion of that onetime in nature? And then, I just want to confirm that I heard correctly that you're expecting a similar percentage of revenue expense going into 2015. Is that correct?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, you heard it, except one part. We said 3.5% to 4%. As you recall, we were giving an assumption in the last quarter, it was 3.5% to 4.5%. But the team did a great job and looked at the procedures, looked at the technology, looked at the processes. We have a dedicated team, worked with our Chief Compliance Officer. And I think it's about -- we project from today points of view, about 3.5% to 4% on compliance expenses of the revenue, '14 revenue. And the second part of the question was?", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just -- is there a portion of that, that is onetime in nature, versus it being in the run rate going forward permanently?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "George, this is Raj. Certainly, we expect that we'll finish some activities this year. But we also expect that there'll be new things that we need to do as we move forward into 2015 and into more geographies. So we believe that 3.5% to 4% is a good range for this year, and it's also good range from where we stand today, for next year.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just on the transaction and revenue growth trends. Overall, nice acceleration across most of the business. Just the Middle East and Africa seemed to slow a bit from the prior quarter. Anything to call out there or...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Not really, George. We're starting to anniversary some of the price decreases that we had, so we're starting to see the impact of that, but nothing in particular there.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just, last question. I don't think I saw the agent count, as of the end of the year.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, it's more than 500,000. We just -- we gave, as I said, before we have more have more than 500,000 agent locations and 100,000 ATMs. I don't think we gave the agent count.", "Michael A. Salop", "Not in the quarter, I think, as Hikmet said during the call, we are going through a process now where we're pruning some of the dormant locations and as compliant, there's more compliance costs around having dormant locations now. So we're looking at that. So there's going to be some ups and downs. But -- so we're reporting more rounded figures. But were over 500,000 at the end of the year.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "So it looks like, if I have it right, the incremental cost actions cost about $0.04, $0.05 in Q4. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, it's...", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, we had about $33 million of kind of non-recurring expenses related to the cost savings initiatives in Q4.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Great. And then just so I'm clear, that -- is it $45 million incremental, on top of the $15 million? Or the $15 million becomes $45 million for the cost savings in 2014?", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, the $15 million becomes $45 million.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Great, great. And then just real quick. As you think about kind of the business impact, the compliance costs, the 3.5% to 4%, longer term, Hikmet, as you think about kind of more incremental capacity coming to market just as more competitors kind of exit, you're starting to see Mexico, is that something you kind of expect to accelerate, as we work our way through the year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's hard to say. But I can generally say that some parts in Mexico, we saw some impact to our, positive impact our transactions. But generally, I would not, from today points of view, I would not -- build a model on that and saying that our revenue was increased. My expectation is that competition will also invest here on the compliance environment and the people who can't do that, maybe they exit. We, will see some, in some markets, they can't afford it, maybe we can get the revenue here. But generally, I would say that we are very much focused on our compliance activities. We are the industry leader. We are focused on that. We are driving it, and we will like to set up. And I believe it's long term. Long term, I believe, yes, it's a competitive advantage, Kevin.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Great. And then, I apologize, last question. Is the buyback factored into the guidance? Or will that be incremental upside, as we think about the buyback we announced today?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Kevin, the buyback is factored into the $1.40 to $1.50 range that we gave.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet, have you seen some of the regional and smaller companies having to deal with some of the compliance issues that you and -- that you're dealing with, or do you anticipate that this will become a little bit more prevalent throughout the industry?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think that -- I can't speak, as I said, for the name of the competition that -- But, believe me, the regulatory environment is very -- changing very fast, evolving. And we are on, I believe, as the industry leader, we are setting here best practices. We are driving it. We have a great compliance officer. We had -- he hired very great people. We do invest our CIO. David Thompson is very focused on the, also on the technology, how we can activate the technology to be more effective on the compliance, making -- the most focus is on the know your agent and know your customer. And so there's some diligence activities. And I believe, we gave -- we were anticipating that in Q3, we told you and we looked at that. And now we are investing, we are -- we signed an agreement with Southwest Border. I am very pleased that has been -- we were -- we had a budget that cost for longer time because we were working with them longer time. So I would say, generally, it's a tough environment. But we, as the industry leader, I believe that we are on top of the things.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then, Raj, I think you said anticipate higher commission rates. Is that just a result of more competition trying to sign agents? Or is that a result of, maybe some of your other agents becoming more mature, so they're moving to different tiers? I guess, what's causing that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Kartik, we do expect some increase in retail commissions this year. That's from recent signings and renewals that we did. We have a long history of being very successful in signing agents. And I think we've been quite successful there. The competitive environment is more difficult in some markets. But in other markets, we've been quite successful. So I don't see that being a long-term trend. I do believe that we have opportunities to take our commissions down, as we add more agents of the mix, and as we actually change our business mix over time with the Digital business, so.", "Hikmet Ersek", "So, Raj, just as a reminder, Kartik, maybe -- sorry, I interrupted you. The top 40 agents, sent agents, top 40 sent agents has been 18 years exclusive with us and --", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "18 years, yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I don't see, Kartik, big changes, it happens year-over-year. But long term, as you recall, Kartik, the commission rates has been going down. I believe that, as we said in '13 already, '14, will have some impact on the commission rates. But also, the other thing will help us is the strong growing electronic channels, dot-com. You don't have the send side agent commission here. I believe also that electronics, westernunion.com, electronic channels long-term will have similar margins, like the company margins. We are investing there now to grow that. We are very pleased with the growth. So I believe that will help our commission rates also, long term.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then just one last one. Raj, so there any opportunity is take additional cost out in 2014 to help offset some of the compliance costs that you'll incur in 2015?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Kartik, we're going to keep looking at our cost structure and look for opportunities to take more costs out. It's not something specific that we're going to call out, because it'll be part of our normal operations. But rest assured that we're continuing to evaluate our cost structure.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, we have a team that is looking hard on our cost structure. So Kartik, we are very focused on that.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Look, I just wanted to add one question in on the compliance cost. As we look forward into further out years, how do we think about how you're really analyzing the growth of that number, in the sense that you're saying it should be relatively similar on a percentage of a revenue basis. And yet, revenue's growing now, and we should expect it to grow again, I think in 2015. And so the dollar number keeps getting bigger. Maybe just give us a little more concrete examples of what's causing that dollar amount to increase? Is it -- that you have to move from U.S. compliance to international, or expecting other areas? Maybe just a little more specific samples, I think would be great.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, you're absolutely right, Darrin. It will be assumed that it will be about 3.5% to 4%. But the more, the expansion, international expansion, the global environment is changing. It's mainly also know your agent and know your customer activities. We have to do more questions on your customers, ask the customer, register the customers, doing diligence on the customers. But also on the agent side, with the front line associates, we are doing more diligence, understanding who is serving our customers. They trust us, and they want to trust also to the -- from loan associates. We do some diligences is there. And I think that's the main investment we're going to continue to happen in the future. Now it is, today points of view, I am pretty much confident that it will be about 3.5% to 4%, from today points of view, and that's what we see.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Darrin, we'll also, keep looking for automation opportunities and look for efficiencies as we move through the next few years, but that's our current estimate. And clearly, we want to automate as much as the activity as we can, over time.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. I appreciate that. And then, just one follow-up. With regard to the opportunities for growth in the non-C2C businesses, I mean, it seems like those are still trending pretty well relative to where they were, a couple of years back. Give us a little more color on any other strategies of change there? Is that just going to keep going, and should we expect this kind of growth, going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I just want to congratulate Raj, that he did a good job on B2B. On the B2B, I am very much -- we have a new leadership here. Kerry comes from the business. He knows the business. And this team is very focused on the sales activities. The existing customers are using us more, we see that the volume of the existing customers is using more. It's also -- you could see that improvement, transaction improvement quarter-by-quarter, revenue improvement quarter-by-quarter. And we also start to expand to the new countries. The other thing we expanded is the new categories, like universities and the NGOs and financial institutions. They started to use us. That has been a strong growth on the B2B. On the C2B business, especially in the U.S., we see a strong growth on the electronic channels. Our electronic channel is growing strong, a little bit slowdown on the walk-in, where the people walk in on our location, want to pay their bills. They do use more on money transfer than using the bills. So generally, I am satisfied. The integration issues then are almost gone. We do -- had some in the beginning, had normal acquisition. And the team worked very hard. I think, it's -- do you want to add something on the B2B here?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, no, the B2B business is well-positioned. Had accelerated growth, as Hikmet said, every quarter of last year. And we expect low double-digit growth this year, throughout the year. So it's well-positioned, whether it's taking more products to the existing markets or new vertical opportunities, or even expanding its distribution, it has an online business that is relatively small right now, but what we want to be in a position there in that business to serve customers however they want. So low touch or high touch, and that business is a good position to be able to do that. So I think it's well positioned.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "If I could just squeeze one last quick one in. There's a lot of -- a lot of times we get questions about your Domestic business. And I think that's now, what, about 7% or 8% of total revenues. And I think the question's coming from the fact there's a lot more P2P models coming to market, whether it's Square Cash or others, that you're seeing offering very low price for that. Is that something we need to watch for you guys? Or are you -- do you think the customer base is really just different enough that it's really not a concern?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think -- as you do, I am watching also every competition. But I am satisfied with the domestic money transfer, especially in the lower bands. Transaction growth rates we see, the customers who want this in minutes. But the higher bands has have an impact. And that's why also, you saw a little bit slowdown on the domestic money transfer. But where I'm very satisfied on the Domestic Money Transfer and team is doing a good job is the electronic parts. People are using, sending fast money from their PCs or from their mobile phones. And one of the strongest growth rate on the westernunion.com is using of the mobile phones. I don't know, I think it's growing very fast there. It's faster than the normal parts, right?", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, And I would just add Darrin, that in the U.S., all of our domestic money transfer is paid out in cash, and about half of it is for emergency purposes. So there are some different use cases there. But you're right, this kind of the new entry is where they most would effect is Domestic Money Transfer. That's something we keep an eye on.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I guess, what I have is more of sort of a qualitative, high level question, and it sort of pertains to the long-term profile of the business, because '13 had its unique charges. '14 is a little bit of a transition year, vis-\u00e0-vis, the compliance spending and so forth. It looks like there are a lots of moving parts. On one hand, pricing to drive transaction growth. And that -- the impact of that on revenue. The higher compliance costs, perhaps, somewhat offset by the cost takeouts. And as well as rising short term commissions, would you think can fall long term? Now I mean it feels to me like, if all of the tailwinds break your way, and some of the headwinds dissipate, we could see accelerating growth in '15? And if it doesn't quite break that way, maybe '14 is more of the template? I'm just wondering, as you long-range plan, how do you handicap all the moving parts? Because if you don't sort of get them all lined up, you can have a year like the '13, '14 kind of transition. So I'm just thinking more of strategically internally. How are you balancing the puts and takes in the business?", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's a very good question, actually. I think -- so what we do is that, we do look at the long-term opportunities on the business. First of all, the good news is that, it's -- the remittance market's a growing market. The global trade market is a growing market. And on the remittance market, we are definitely leading, but we have a 16%, 17% market share. So it's huge -- there's still room to grow, especially on the Digital where our emphasis is that we can grow. There's no company, from a strategic point of view, can -- in the hybrid economy, can connect cash with digital, ATM with the account, account with the business, business with the consumer, in 200 countries. I believe we are very well-positioned on the respond to the global economic changes with our omni channel, multi-channel strategy. That's #1, it's a growing economy, and that's doing that. The regulatory environment has been an evolving environment the last 2 years, and especially fast-changing. And I believe also, that the investments we do today will respond for the future environments, and it will be putting us long-term, in a competitive advantage. You've been following us, Andrew, for so long. You know of our brands, how our brand awareness, we are -- it's high, it's very, very high, and the people like us. And they use us. I don't have to talk about that. So I do see, really quite good growth opportunities. Lastly, our business model is a fantastic business model. On the 35% of our costs, fixed costs, 65% are variable costs. And once you grow the revenue, I think also it will help our profit growth and margin expansion over time.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. You make me feel old, Hikmet. One more, just to follow on, if I may. You mentioned the macro. Can you quantify how much in improving global remittance volume growth environment informs your '14 revenue growth outlook? And I assume that from all indications, it's -- '14's going to be a better year than '13, and '13 was better than '12.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I -- we believe that the '14, from global economy, I believe that things has not changed. I mean, they are always ups and downs in the different part of the world. But a World Bank saves about 6% to 7% of principal, and the revenue will be a little bit lower, about 3% to 4% in revenue growth over the next few, over 2014 and next few years, I guess, is that right, Mike? Mike is looking at me...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Price declines and those kind of things, you would expect revenue to be lower than that in the industry.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, a little bit lower than the principal growth because of pricing. In terms of our outlook for '14, basically, it's assumed a similar economic situation in '14 and '13, a couple of exceptions. Southern Europe has been doing better for us in the back half of last year. And then, as Raj mentioned, we have accounted for some of the turbulence we're seeing in the currency changes in some of the emerging markets, particularly in South America.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "My first question is on CapEx. So '13 was, what, 4.4% of revenues. You guys are talking about down the road, 2% to 3%. How do you get there, in terms of bringing it down to that lower level?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Ashwin, our -- we would not expect to be at the 2% to 3% level. I expect the CapEx will be more in the 5% range for 2014. And the increase is primarily driven by higher compliance-related activities that we're putting in place, as well as discontinued investment in our -- in the faster growing areas of our business. So I think in any given year, we might expect it to be between 4% and 5%, but that would be the expected range.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Oh, got it, okay. And to what extent -- it wasn't clear to me, to what extent is the buyback of $500 million dependent on making those working capital changes? What specifically are you doing that, there?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Ashwin we, yes, we have -- as you can imagine, we have payment flows all over the world, billions and billions of dollars of payment flows. So what we're doing is taking advantage of those payment flows and just utilizing intercompany working capital in a more effective and efficient manner. And that will continue to give us opportunities down the road, I believe. So that's primarily what we're doing.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So that will be a one-time benefit to get that, and then it becomes part of doing business?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, it becomes part of doing business. It's well within what we can do in terms of our payment flows. So it's a strategy that we've been utilizing, we plan to continue to utilize. But it's just looking for pockets of opportunity. As you know, we added Travelex and Custom House and other entities as part of the business. So they have a lot of payment flows between them. And so it just allows us to look for more opportunities in that regard.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That makes sense. And then you will use all of that to do the $500 million buyback? It wasn't clear, all of that in the second half?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, that will be the primary way of doing the buyback. And it depends on overall cash flows of the business during the course of the year, and how the company performs. So it'll be a combination of things. But primarily, it's the working capital strategy.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. Last question, if I may. From a pricing strategy perspective, as I look at your website over time, and try to figure out what you're charging for people. It seems like over time, you've been shifting, perhaps to a lower fee-base, it's always 0 fee, that $1 fee kind of thing, with a greater focus on making money out of FX. Is that -- I mean, could you say that, that's sort of the direction you're going in more clearly than before? Is that a -- I mean, what kind of difference does that make to your business, Raj?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I'll take that one. Absolutely not, it's not the strategy. I think the fees continue to be a main driver of our revenue, and will stay as a main driver of our revenue. It really depends, as you know our business very well, Ashwin. It really depends on the corridor, right? In a competitive corridor, where the price -- revenues are -- sorry, fees are lower, you could definitely also respond to the market environment than to -- also have on the foreign exchange. It really depends on the -- market by market, corridor pricing actions. And I would say that it's -- our strategy on the pricing has not changed. We feel comfortable and we will continue to evolve our pricing corridor by corridor as business as usual.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from David Togut of Evercore.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Hikmet, when the 2014 proxy is published in the next few weeks, what will be the primary drivers of management compensation for 2014? And then, if you could look out longer term, as well.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, let's wait until the proxy has been published. Obviously, I have to talk up with the board and everything. But generally, overall, I would say that our compensation has been, always performance-based. My CEO compensation was very much in the past, always, as you know, very much variable, long-term focus, on the shareholder focus. That -- I don't think that's going to change. And -- but let's wait until the proxy's -- comes out in a few weeks.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "But I guess, broadly speaking, what are the primary financial metrics that the board wants management to be compensated based upon?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, revenue and profit.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And are there broad, long-term targets for that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, there are. Of our long-term targets, we do have some targets. Yes, we are very much on revenue growth and profit growth focused.", "David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And what are the targets?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We don't give long-term guidance.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes David, there are annual targets and then there are long-term targets as well. The long-term ones are -- we don't make public.", "Operator", "And next, we have Tom McCrohan of Janney.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Are there any insights you can give us on adding new customers and the recent pricing actions, or maybe usage patterns, repeat customers, from the investments you made on the pricing side?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think, most of the pricing actions we did in was the main corridors, I could see that we did gain some market share. In some quarters, we were losing market share like in Mexico, the customers came back to us. And also, in some corridors, where we, there are compliance issues as the customer joined us. I would say also, in some corridors, where we are entering new, is -- where we had very good response to the new pricing, like in digital area. But in the digital, especially 80% of the customers did not use our service the last 12 months. We know that they are registered customers. We check that every time, and they did not use it. And so it's a good response to the pricing actions.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And on the importance of mobile seems critical long-term. Is there any chronic developments, soon-to-be launched in 2014, even mobile and the online side, that is worthwhile calling out?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Absolutely, absolutely. We are very focused on the mobile. Mobile, more are using as a -- on our digital send site. We do have apps. I mean, I can only recommended that you download our apps and use our app. It's a really good moving, fast-moving. You have to register and then customers are very satisfied. We get also reviews about our apps. And the apps will be expanded to the different countries. And mobile is -- the people are to -- use mobile phones more often. They do use their send money in a spontaneous environment at different use cases.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And if you disclose, like what percentage of the total C2C transactions are initiated on mobile and online?", "Hikmet Ersek", "We did not disclose that. But I can only say that 5% of our revenue is electronic.", "Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Last question. Just what share count assumption as baked into your 2014 EPS guidance?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "We have -- we just assume that the buyback, that the majority of the stock will be bought back this year. So I think I gave you the ending share count. So you just help to make so much assumptions around that, in terms of overall share count.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So 549, end of the year and then assume that 500 million is exhausted?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "The majority of the program would be exhausted this year.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, the basic share count, so it is a little bit higher. [Operator Instructions]", "Operator", "And that question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just want to make sure I have the math right on the electronic channels. And I know you indicated it was 5% of revenue in 2013. So I think that comes out to about $275 million or so. Are you still reinforcing the $500 million target for 2015? And if so, just talk about your confidence level in seeing the kind of growth acceleration that you would need to see in 2014 and 2015 to get there? Because I think you grew it probably about 25% in 2013.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I'm getting day by day more confident on the -- to reach our goal, approximately $500 million. The reason for that is our revenue growth is accelerating quarter-by-quarter. The reason -- the main reason of that, as you recall, as we disclose our strategy, the first strategy was acquiring customers. And we are acquiring customers. And we know once you acquire customers, they do use more often the digital westernunion.com. So -- and that's -- plan really started to work out. The people are using it. The other factor why I am -- where we have this target and we did not change to approximately $500 million target, is we are expanding to more countries. Now we are in 24 countries, sending money to 200 countries. So that's going to continue the expansion of our westernunion.com site, send sites, to the countries that you can connect online with our 500,000 locations or 100,000 ATMs.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And any update on Walgreens, as far as whether or not the roll out there has started across their 8,000 locations. Anything you can tell us when that roll out might be done?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think the teams, our technical teams and operational teams, are working together to combine their host with our host. We did not launch it yet. And so -- but the teams are working hard on that to launch it.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But you still expect it to be launched, I guess, relatively soon, is that fair?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I don't have an update. Maybe I'll take -- you can, Mike, would take the call afterwards. I don't have an update in front of me. But I assume that's the case. It's one of our major agents. We are very focused on that.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question. Obviously, it seems like Raj is doing a great job so far in the CFO seat, but I know the interim tag is still there. When do you think we'll get an update on the CFO search?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "You want me to answer that?", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Absolutely.", "Hikmet Ersek", "The good thing is that Raj really knows the business. He is the Interim CFO, but he's an internal candidate. He is one of our highest talents in the company. He has been a great -- he has been sitting in different functions. So he knows the business very well, especially given the complex business, evolving business. He is doing a great job. But I also launched the CFO search. I'm looking at all the options. And we believe that we will announce that soon, the fixed CFO role.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We hope to talk to you soon. And have a good evening.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and interim Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's first quarter 2014 results, and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call.

We are pleased with how we started the year. Our core money transfer business continued to rebound and key growth areas such as westernunion.com online money transfer and Western Union Business Solutions delivered strong performance. We also continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders. Overall, first quarter revenues increased 2% or 4% constant currency. This improvement trend reflects benefits from the previously implemented consumer money transfer pricing actions, the investments in Digital and the investments in Business Solutions that we put in place over the last couple of years. Consumer money transfer transactions increased a healthy 9% in the quarter. Both international and U.S.-generated transactions, including domestic money transfer, delivered strong transaction growth.", "As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the rebound in our retail-initiated consumer money transfer business, which represents approximately 95% of our C2C money transfer revenue. Total C2C revenue increased 3% in the quarter or 4% constant currency, as the pricing actions and other promotions we undertook beginning in late 2012 are now translating into revenue growth. Mexico, for example, delivered an 8% increase in revenues, which was the country's first positive quarterly revenue growth in 2 years. In addition to the pricing actions, Mexico has also benefited from the competitive market changes and strong growth from our Vigo brands.", "Westernunion.com money transfer revenue growth accelerated to 45% in the quarter, driven by more consumer acquisition, stronger retention and increased revenue per customer. Enhancements to our platforms, mobile services, pay-in and payout options and risk management in various markets all contributed to the strong results. Mobile access continues to grow fast. In the first quarter, over 30% of our U.S. westernunion.com transactions were initiated through mobile devices. Our total electronic channels revenue increased 36% in the quarter.", "As I have mentioned in the past, we believe digitally initiated money transfer is the fastest-growing segment of the market, and it is bringing new customer segments to Western Union. We have westernunion.com online money transfer sites in 24 countries and payout capabilities in over 200 countries and territories. As we combine this foundation with ongoing service additions and enhancements, we have a great opportunity to continue to expand our online business globally. In addition, providing consumers more choice by offering our services through other online and mobile relationships remains a key part of our strategy.", "We are pleased with Business Solutions, which delivered a third consecutive quarter of low double-digit constant currency revenue growth. Our focus on sales execution, customer retention and more products and services is leading to good results in the growing B2B market. I would also like to highlight our strong cash flow generation, which allowed us to again return significant funds to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned nearly $250 million through dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our past practices, we seek to balance appropriate investment in the business with returning available funds to shareholders. Our dividend yield is around 3%. And as we mentioned last quarter, we have a $500 million share repurchase authorization in place, which we currently expect to utilize most of this year.", "So based on this good start of the year, we have affirmed our 2014 financial outlook. As we look to the future, our organization is focused on serving our customers. Globally, many people have unmet financial needs for cause for the money movement. They may be migrants, small business owners, travelers, NGOs. There are many use cases, and we strive to provide solution to those needs. Our vision is to be the recognized global leader in providing innovative solutions, high-service levels and omni-channel integration for cross-border and cross-currency money transfer. Over the past few years, we invested in the business and in our foundation. We plan to continue to leverage our global network, compliance and operational capabilities, and we believe we are well positioned to connect the digital and physical worlds for consumers and businesses alike.", "In 2014, we continued to focus on 3 key areas: strengthening consumer money transfer with an emphasis on digital expansion, growing Western Union Business Solutions and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. We believe our first quarter results are tracking with our plans in these areas, and we look forward to continue to drive the business and report our progress throughout the year.", "Now to give you a more detail on the first quarter financial results, I would like to turn the call over to Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Thank you, Hikmet. As mentioned, the first quarter results were in line with our expectations and consistent with our full year outlook. Total revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 2% or 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consumer money transfer, Business Solutions and consumer bill payments each delivered positive constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue increased 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis. The 3% growth compares to a 1% decline in reported revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Revenue trends continued to improve from prior quarters as transaction growth remains strong, and we passed the anniversary of some of the key price actions. Total transactions increased 9% in the quarter, driven by our previously implemented pricing actions in key corridors and strong growth in westernunion.com and other electronic channels. The World Bank and Aite each recently issued updated market estimates for cross-border remittances. Both estimated 2013 cross-border principal growth at 4%, which was consistent with our results last year. And their 2014 projections for the market range from 5% to 7%. Western Union's C2C cross-border principal increased 8% in the first quarter or 9% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 1% and was flat constant currency. The spread between the C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 6 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. For C2C, the impact of net price decreases was approximately 3% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 2%. The price impact primarily relates to actions taken in 2013, and we still anticipate 2014 pricing actions to be modest and back in line with historical standards.", "Turning to the regions. In addition to strong transaction trends, each of the regions delivered improved constant currency revenue growth rates relative to last year's fourth quarter. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 1% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency with Germany continuing to deliver strong growth. Transactions in the region increased 10%, aided by the pricing actions implemented in 2013. North America revenue grew 1% in the quarter, including a negative 1% impact from currency, and transactions increased 4%. The revenue increase was an improvement from the declines in the region each quarter in 2013. U.S. to Mexico and U.S. outbound both delivered good revenue growth in the quarter. Mexico revenue grew 8%, and transactions increased 12%. Domestic money transfer revenue increased 1% on transaction growth of 5% in the quarter, and we continue to see most of the growth coming from the lower principal bands. U.S. domestic money transfer represents approximately 8% of total company revenues.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue increased 4% compared with the year-ago quarter with a positive 1% impact from currency, and transactions increased 8%. Saudi Arabia and the UAE were key drivers of the region's revenue growth. Asia Pacific revenue grew 1%, including a negative 3% impact from currency translation and benefited from growth in the Philippines and Japan. Transactions in Asia Pacific increased 8%. The Latin America and Caribbean region was -- revenue was down 4% from the prior year period, including a negative 9% impact from currency. The currency impact was primarily due to the weakening of the Argentine peso. Transactions increased 6% in the region.", "Finally, westernunion.com delivered strong C2C revenue growth of 45% in the quarter, while transactions increased 55%. U.S.-originated online transactions grew 56%. wu.com had strong revenue growth in many key corridors, including U.S. and U.K. to India, U.S. to the Philippines, U.S. to Mexico and U.S. domestic money transfer. In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 4% in the quarter, but increased 7% on a constant currency basis. The differential between the reported and constant currency rates was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In the U.S., growth in the electronic bill pay business was partially offset by a decline from cash walk-in, which is consistent with prior trends. Business Solutions revenue grew 7% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Strong performance from Australia and Canada and good growth in customers use of hedging products helped drive the constant currency revenue increase.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The first quarter GAAP operating margin was 20.1% compared to 22.4% in the prior-year period. The margin decline was primarily a result of higher average C2C retail commission rates, increased compliance expenses and higher funding costs in consumer bill payments. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower integration costs. Average retail commission rates increased as expected, primarily due to the renewal of some large agents. Compliance expense in the quarter was approximately 3% of revenue. We continue to expect compliance expense to be in the 3.5% to 4% range for the year as we hire people and implement more programs in the complex, evolving global environment. Funding costs in consumer bill payments increased due to higher interchange costs, which were driven by more credit card usage from our customers and larger principal transactions. The benefits from cost savings initiatives relate primarily to comparisons with costs in the first quarter of last year when we incurred $8 million of expenses related to cost savings initiatives and Travelex Global Business Payments integration. We also began to realize some of the related cost savings in this year's first quarter, although we expect most of the incremental $45 million in anticipated savings for the year to be in the remaining 3 quarters. EBITDA margin was 25.1% in the quarter compared to 27.1% a year ago. Our tax rate of 10.7% in the first quarter benefited from some discrete items, including the impact of some foreign currency fluctuations. We expect a rate of around 15% for the full year.", "Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.37, which was the same as the prior year period. The C2C operating segment margin was 22.9% compared to 25.4% in the prior year period, with the decline driven primarily by higher average retail commission rates and increased compliance costs, partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 20.2% compared to 24.7% in the prior year period. The margin decline was primarily due to the higher funding costs related to increased interchange expense. Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $4 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $6 million for the same period last year. Both quarters included depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million. The reduction in operating loss was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and lower integration costs, partially offset by timing of certain expenses.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $197 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $46 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.8 billion and cash of $1.7 billion. Approximately 40% of the cash was held by United States entities. In February, we paid off $500 million of maturing debt, which had already been prefunded with issuances last year. We spent $180 million on share repurchases in the quarter, retiring 11 million shares and paid $68 million in dividends. At quarter end, we had 539 million shares outstanding and $320 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in June 2015. So we believe the year has started off on track. Our consumer money transfer business revenue trends have improved. wu.com and other electronic channels are strong, and Business Solutions is delivering good growth. We continue to both invest in the business and return funds to shareholders. Based on the first quarter results and current business trends, we are affirming the full year financial outlook that we provided in February, including our outlook for earnings per share in a range of $1.40 to $1.50.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So good execution on the transaction growth, continuing to see momentum for the pricing changes. I guess, first of all, can you give us some color on -- you may have said this on the call, or maybe I missed it. But the actual growth in transactions where you didn't change pricing in the corridor, what was that this quarter? And maybe a little more context as to the growth trends you're seeing online. I know the numbers look very good, continuing to be in the 50% plus range. But what would we expect to see once some of the pricing changes there anniversary?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Hey, Darrin. This is Raj. Thanks for the question. We didn't break out the price corridors in terms of transaction growth this time, so you didn't miss that. As we've said before, the price actions typically will allow transactions to peak within a 12-month period. So we've more than anniversaried most of the price actions. And so that's really part of our normal business. So we're not going to break that out anymore. But clearly, those price actions are having a positive impact on our transaction growth. And with respect to Dot.com, we're very pleased with the results there. 55% transaction growth, that's very much in line with expectations and 45% revenue growth, which is a significant step-up from last quarter. We would expect the transaction growth to moderate somewhat, but the revenue growth continues to accelerate there.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. That's helpful. With respect to the -- go ahead. We're you going to...", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes. Just going to add. Online, we're always doing a lot of things in terms of promotion and looking at the right price points. But the major pricing actions we did there were in the fourth quarter of '12, so we've anniversaried those already.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up. On the online business, I mean, with respect to margins on the domestic business or the business overall, I mean, you've said in the past, those margins are in line with corporate averages. Does that still hold true? And any other opportunities you see improve margins in the U.S, whether it's East to East [ph] development, or any other technological innovations that might help that along? And then lastly, are you still on track for the $500 million target for the electronic business that you'd laid out awhile back?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. Let me try. And maybe Hikmet, you can jump in afterwards. But in terms of margins, again, we're really pleased with the growth in the business. Clearly, we're in investment mode right. And right now, we're below company average margins. But we do believe that as the business scales and grows that top line like it is that we will be able to get closer to the company margins on an average basis. As we rollout more funding options, paying in by bank or paying out to a bank account, clearly, that will help the margin picture. But that business continues to deliver on our expectations, and we're very pleased with the results there overall.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I -- Darrin, just to add on that. Don't forget that we are in 24 countries with our online money transfer and send countries, and we are connecting to 200 countries. That gives us a huge portfolio. We are very pleased with our U.S. money transfer. We are very pleased with our transaction growth on the main corridors. Besides that, that really attracts also new customers to our network. We know that. From our data, 80% of our customers are new to westernunion.com online, are money transfer customers. And we are pleased with that. By the way, it doesn't cannibalize our existing business. That question comes up every time. We know that our business like U.S. to Philippines, U.S. to India, it's not going on, on the online very strong. It's also retail money transfer. We had saw a solid growth, good growth there. So I'm generally pleased with the business performance.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. Just the last one. I'll turn it back to the queue. The pricing changes you put into effect over the -- from 2012 onward, I mean, those really should start to see more and more inflection, I think, as I mentioned, earlier also, which means from a revenue-per-transaction standpoint, that should start to get better. I mean, with regard to respective pricing changes going forward, I mean, what should we expect? I mean, are we really back to the 1% to 2% or 3% change now per year? Is that something we can use to model?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I feel comfortable with our historical pricing models, Darrin. I mean, we always do pricing actions in corridor by corridor. We look at that, we always did that. And as you know, our business is quite complex. We are in 16,000 corridors. We look band by band. We look corridor by corridor. But I'm pleased with our current pricing structure, also with our historical direction. I don't see any big changes coming in near term.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to get your general reaction to Walmart's initiative that was announced a couple of weeks ago. I mean, you guys expecting any kind of share loss around that, or any sort of competitive response? And do you guys expect that Walmart will ultimately extend that service to include cross-border remittances to its stores in places like Mexico or elsewhere? And if so, is that a potential concern for you? Or is that something that you have a plan of attack against?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I can't talk about Walmart's plans, obviously. It's not our agent, and it doesn't impact us so much because we have a very strong U.S. domestic money transfer business. Just putting under perspective, it's only 8% of our total company revenues. And putting things on perspective, we have many, many agents globally, which gives us 500,000 locations. It gives us -- we have thousands of contracts. And none of our countries are bigger than 5% of our total revenue and none of our biggest -- even the largest agent is not bigger than 4% of our total company revenue. So the diversification of portfolio, that's the beauty of Western Union business. Being everywhere, having so many agents distributing our revenue, it gives in a very good position. Basic, on the U.S. domestic money transfer business, I mean, our business have been growing very good in Q1, right? We grew by 1% by revenue and 5% by transaction. And these are the actions -- don't forget, these are the actions we've put in place in 2009, still growing, and we are gaining with 5 for 50 promotions a lot of transactions, lower band. We are pleased with our transactions. We have 46,000 locations. I don't know how many Walmart has, about 4,000 locations or something like that. So our 46,000 locations do serve customers. The customers value the speed. The customers value our brand. The customers value our locations. But we do also pricing actions if you need it quarter-by-quarter, band by band. But it's -- I just want to put things in perspective here.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Right. Right. But it sounds like, for now, you guys aren't planning on having to take any material new pricing actions for the balance of this year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I don't think -- if you look at our portfolio, as I said earlier to Darrin, we do always look at pricing quarter-by-quarter, band by band, product by product, but I don't think that we are going to have big material pricing actions this year.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Any impact on your business in Russia or the surrounding reasons just from all the geopolitical tension? I mean, anything that's been detectable?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Good that you asked that question. Being in 200 countries, we always have this [indiscernible].", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Right. With Arab Spring a couple of years ago.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I know. You asked that question. I remember. But no, we don't see -- just to put again here the perspective, Russia is a very important market for is, but it's only 2% of our total company revenue, Ukraine is about 1% of our total company revenue. But we do have about 20,000 locations in Russia, and we do have about 15,000 locations in Ukraine, which gives us a good presence here. And we don't see any customer changes, behavior changes from our current business. We don't see any impact from the environment there yet.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's great to know. And just one housekeeping for Raj on the tax side. Can you just review what the tax benefit in Q1 was? I know you said you're still going to be 15% for the full year. Is that kind of a similar tax rate each of the last 3 quarters? Or are there any ins and outs that we should be thinking about from a modeling perspective to get us to the full year 15%?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Jason, there were just some discrete benefits every some in Q1. Some of it's related to currency benefits. We still expect the tax rate for the year to be around 15%. And we'll -- as we move through the year, we'll see what that means for us overall. But there were just some discrete benefits in Q1.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just some onetime stuff? Okay.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a follow-on to Jason's question with Walmart, just the private label or store-to-store concept, in general. Do you see the potential for some of your larger against to consider doing something similar? I know it's a big change in the model. But from a foot traffic standpoint, I can see why certain agents might want to try it. Thoughts there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I don't see -- I don't know any plans that -- any white label plans from our constant -- retail agents that it's going to do something like that. I can't talk for their plan. But don't forget, our 46,000 locations is easy to go to next corner and pick up the money from next corner in the U.S. We have, alone in the U.S., 46,000 locations. And it's -- I believe we are very competitive here. We'd really -- the U.S. domestic money transfer, Raj, was growing quarter-by-quarter over the past years, right?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And we've been executing principal here. I don't -- I can't speak what the -- I don't hear any rumors on the market, and I can't speak to rumors.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Good. Just wanted to make sure. I appreciate that. Just on the -- I heard the commission comment -- I'm curious about just the renewal rate of large agents and, specifically just, exclusivity opening up, is that changing the pace? Is that changing at all as you go into the renewal process?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No. I think we do see sometimes competitive environment, sometimes not. But having personally negotiated hundreds of agent negotiations, and we have thousands of agents. There will be always some competitor. Sometimes, a higher agent commission. Sometimes, a lower. We do see some higher agent commissions in the current environment -- competitive environment that also impacts a little bit our bottom line. But generally, I would say that I do not see big changes from agent commissions. But we do, in some corridors, you know how it works, Tien-tsin, negotiation by negotiation, agent by agent, country by country, regulatory environment, all that affects the agent negotiations so...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "And Tien-tsin, just to add, our goal, longer term, is to bring overall distribution costs down, and we believe that we can achieve that with the mix of the business as it changes to be a little bit more electronic. And then as we bring new agents into the mix, we also believe that we can bring them in at a generally lower overall commission rate. So there are a lot of different dynamics in that business, and we're working through all of those to get the right results.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's a good point, Raj, but yes.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. That's great. And then Raj, just housekeeping, no restructuring cost this quarter, did I hear that correctly? That's all I have.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. We have some minor costs. But unless there is something more material, we probably won't break that out. It's just part of our normal business. We're continuously looking for opportunities to take cost out of the business. And so nothing material.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just wanting to see if we can get an update on the impact of the higher compliance costs. What kind of impact that had on transaction volumes do you guys figure?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Bryan, let me start with that. We did see some impact in the first quarter. As you know, we mentioned that for the full year, we expect about a 1- to 2-point negative impact on our top line. That's still in our outlook. That's still what we expect, especially as we ramp up in the compliance spending. We spent about 3% in the first quarter, and we expect that to ramp up the rest of the year in the 3.5% to 4% range. So we do still expect some impact to the top line.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just seeing this through. I mean, the common question we get is, does that continue into 2015? Will you still have an additional 1 to 2 head point -- or 1 to 2 points of headwind from compliance, or does it start to level out?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Well, my -- our goal is to not have much impact, but that's something that we can't predict. What we do is when we put these compliance actions in place, initially, we see a negative customer reaction, and we'd like to learn from those customer experiences and improve upon those over time. And that's really our goal. So I can't really predict about next year. But the goal is to improve upon the interactions with customers and put the right systems and processes in place so that the customer experience can be a better one.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Saying that, though, the 2014 investment, Bryan, 3.5% to 4%, was a significant step-up from the last year investment. So we believe that we will have good programs in place. I can't say -- speak, as Raj said, for the future of how the relative environment looks like. But from today point of view, I think that team is doing a great job, putting the things right in place that we have with the compliance programs that it's a competitive -- even a competitive advantage. And I can see that part of that competitive advantage already in some countries like Mexico. Part of our growth in the Mexico is driven through the compliance environment, and we do have programs. We are increasing our programs, and we are investing here. And we are trying to build a competitive advantage like in Mexico and in other countries.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. I was going to ask that. On the higher compliance costs, where -- which corridors are being impacted by that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, it's a global program, by the way, right? So I mean, we have to -- it's a really -- it has a -- if you are in 200 countries, it's beautiful. But it has also a price to be in 200 countries, and that's the main corridor. It's you know that in the past, we invested in Southwest Border. That's -- additional to that, we have this investment like in the European union. We do have investments in some receiving countries and in Africa. And we do have in Middle East. It's all over actually, Bryan. And I think we have a good program that we cover the world with that investment.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "And we have various KYC programs that we're implementing. We're implementing know-your-agent programs. It's pretty broad based, and it's in various parts of the world, as Hikmet said.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Last question for me. Europe and the CIS region, the transaction growth accelerated. I guess I'm curious on the economic front. Any signs of stability, finally, in that region that's causing that, or just would be curious to know if we're getting any kind of economic -- potential economic rebound?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, my view didn't change from last quarter. Unfortunately, it didn't change, I would love to report that the economic environment is better, but it's also not worse, that's the fortunate part. So I would say that it's the same. We do see some strong transaction growth in Germany. We do see some improvement in Southern European part like Spain and Italy. Our business is quite stable there, but I wouldn't say that it's now sunshine yet there.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes. We did a lot of the pricing actions in Europe in the first half of last year as well, so we're getting some benefit from that now.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "This is Rayna Kumar for David. Do you expect to increase your dividend? And when will the board be making a decision on the dividend?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure. Hey, Rayna. This is Raj. The dividend is something that we evaluate on an ongoing basis with the board. We're very happy with where the dividend is right now. It's at about a 35% payout, which is very much in line with S&P 500 paying companies. So I expect that as the business performs and improves, the board will want to look at that again to see what the right level is. But our policy has been to return capital to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends, and I expect that we'll continue that as well.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to go back to Mexico for a minute. You signed an additional, I think it was 10,000 agents in Mexico last year. Are those now all up and running? And are you comfortable with the current footprint in Mexico? Or do you think you'll continue to make a bigger push to expand in the region?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Sara, first of all, we are very pleased with our quarter on Mexico. I have to say that the 8% revenue growth is quite good. We did put programs, compliance programs, agent programs into place that -- they are working. We did sign agents to expand our footprint in Mexico. We are -- did not enroll all of them yet. They are in the pipeline and we believe that we're going to significantly increase our presence in Mexico with new host-to-host connections, new IT systems and new programs there. And I'm quite excited. Actually, I was in Mexico about 2 weeks ago and just came back from a meeting there and -- with a new potential agent there. And I was quite excited to increase my footprint there.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So it sounds like some more to come. And then as we think about the balance of the year, your comparisons get significantly more difficult throughout the year in terms of transactions. Is it reasonable to think that the trend should flow in the back half of the year on a more difficult comp?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "As we -- Sara, we did see some pricing as well to Mexico, and we -- typically, we expect the pricing actions to cause transactions to peak within a 12-month period. So I expect that transaction growth is likely to level off. But we can't really predict what's going to happen each quarter. But generally, that would be the trend that we would see. We also expect to see good revenue growth for the year. So that's about where we are. Revenue growth would typically pick up in the 12 to 18 months period after pricing. And so that's what we're seeing.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Sorry, was that comment about transactions overall or Mexico-specific?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Overall.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Overall.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think that the -- what we did -- Sara, we did thousands of pricing actions, and we do it constantly quarter-by-quarter. And if you do that, the cost -- revenue picks up about 12 to 18 months. And that generally has been not only Mexico, worldwide.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just another question on compliance. Can you give us an update on the subpoena that you disclosed in your 10-K from the middle district of Pennsylvania? And has there been any update since the 10-K on that issue?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. Smitti, I would just refer you to our 10-Q that we are filing today. We don't really have more comments beyond that. It's early in the process, and it's something that we're working through. We have good monitoring systems in place. We have a multifaceted program to prevent consumer fraud and an outreach [ph] program with consumers. So that's about all we can say right now, and we're working through that.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then maybe just on the Digital channel where you continue to see very good growth. Can you talk about how you're investing in westernunion.com and some of the other new solutions?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally, why don't you just give a shout to me. I don't know.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. That team is doing a great job, and I've spent a fair amount of time with them, and they're hitting on all cylinders. The 3 key areas that they're spending on: First is around the consumer experience. They have a new platform in place, and we're rolling that out to more markets. We're also adding more funding capabilities in different markets. Secondly, we're also adding more customers to the mix. And as Hikmet mentioned earlier, 80% of the customers that are visiting wu.com are new to the Western Union franchise. So we're adding significant new customers. And lastly, we're expanding distribution, either through ourselves or through other partners. So those are where the primary investments are, and they're paying off, as you can see. And we're very pleased with the results.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess my first question was, I'm trying to understand the spread between wu.com transactions and revenues. And it seems to fluctuate a lot between just 20% this quarter because it's been as high as 40%. Why does it bounce around so much? And why is it so different from the spread in your traditional business, which is more like mid-single digits?", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes, Ashwin. This is Mike. We did some major pricing actions primarily in the fourth quarter of last year. There were some things we did prior to that as well. But we had some major actions in the fourth quarter. So we just anniversaried those as we went through the fourth quarter of 2013. It's just that we did those in the fourth quarter of '12. So now we have passed that anniversary, and it's more just mix issues and other promotions in the business. And that's why the spread has narrowed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Now my second question is with regards to segment margins, and I'm kind of looking at C2B margins and also B2B x integration costs, and they were both down. Is that currency in the C2B? Well, I'm trying to understand why in each of those areas why margins were down. And what's the trend we should expect going through the year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure. Ashwin, this is Raj. On the C2B business, as I mentioned in some of my comments, there were a couple of things that impacted us there were, higher credit card usage by our customers. We opened up some new funding options in certain parts of our business, so consumers started to use more carded-type transactions. Secondly, we had higher principal transactions as well, and some of that higher PPT was related to the severe weather we had in the U.S., which caused utility payments to be higher. So that business achieved about a 20% margin last year, and that's about where it is in the first quarter, and I would expect it to be in that range for the year as well. With respect to B2B, that business -- last year, we achieved low-teens EBITDA x integration. And in the first quarter, we had some timing of expenses that drove the margins down. But I would expect to see that improve as we move through the course of the year. Longer term, we still expect that business to expand margins as it gains scale and leverages the infrastructure that it's put in the last couple of years. So those are some of the reasons behind the margins that you saw in the first quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And also, I'm trying to understand with regards to C2C transaction growth. Obviously, through the course of last year, transaction growth rebounded pretty nicely. But it seems to have plateaued the last 3 quarters right around 9%. And is it fair to expect further acceleration? Or is it kind of upper-single digit is about what you can do without price concessions and more marketing dollars? Or how should we think of that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Ashwin, we haven't really provided a transaction growth outlook. And so I won't give you a specific number. But generally, as we have said, the pricing actions are driving a lot of the transaction growth that you've seen in the last 3 quarters, and that continues to have a good effect. But we would normally see transaction growth leveling off after -- within a 12-month period. But then the thing that we are seeing is that as expected, the revenue growth is picking up. In the 12 to 18 months after a pricing, we typically expect to see revenue growth pick up, which is what's happening. So those are some of the parameters. I would expect transaction growth, to your question though, to level off.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Understood. One last housekeeping question. You did mention in the Q, you have about $700 million in the U.S. I just wanted to clarify, is all of that really available for any actions you might want to take, buybacks, whatever?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "If it was all available, I would probably use it. But most of the cash on the balance sheet is not available. We had $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and, as you said, about $700 million in the U.S. A lot of it is cash in-transit. Another chunk, we hold for regulatory purposes. And then we just need money for liquidity purposes. We move hundreds of billions of dollars around every year, and we need to keep some cash on hand for liquidity purposes. But clearly, we do things as efficiently as we can. And to the extent that there's any excess cash, we will use it. But I would say most of it's not readily available.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to start off on the compliance side. Nice to see you reiterate the compliance amounting to about 3.5% to 4% of revenue this year. But will that be uniform throughout the course of the year? Or should we see 1 quarter versus another maybe have a little bit more or a little bit less of that expense?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Hey, George. It's Raj. The -- I can't give you a quarterly number on that. We expect about 3.5% to 4%, and it really depends on the pace at which we hire and the pace at which we put programs in place. Clearly we're going to try to do things as efficiently as we can. And if we don't need to spend the money, we won't. But that's our current expectation for the full year.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just for the first quarter, were you within that range, 3.5% or 4%? Or can you share that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Okay. That's our full year expectation. For the first quarter, we were at 3%.", "Hikmet Ersek", "We were at 3%, yes.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. 3%, 3%. Okay. And then just going back to your commentary around trying to add some leverage in the margin in terms of long term bringing commissions down. Obviously, it's a competitive landscape, but some of the steps that we saw recently or some of the announcements. As it relates to Walmart, do you think that could potentially impede a competitor from maybe approaching some of your agent partners on the receive side? Just curious what your thoughts are there.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, competition was always here, right? We all -- George, we were always competing. And I've been in the market 14 years, and I've been always competing with the competition here. But I don't see any big changes. Don't forget that our top 40 agents have been 17 years exclusive with us. They like us. They like our brand. They like that we bring customers to them. They like that it's a win-win situation. And they like to serve our customers. And I did not see any big changes here. We do have definitely agent by agent some negotiations. And sometimes, the negotiations are tough. Sometimes, you have to fly around the world and do these negotiations. But it's a win-win situation. And I'm very pleased with our current agent structure, and that gives us 500,000 locations, 100,000 ATMs, and that's a huge, huge, huge number.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet, I know you said you haven't heard any rumors about agents wanting to do private label. But I'm wondering in your top 30 agents, do any of them have the option to do a private label if they wanted to?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, don't forget, we do have agents for years. They do. They have their own money transfer business in some countries internationally, right? They do have -- banks, for instance. We work with banks. They have been doing money transfer for years, and they switch to us, or they do both. I don't see -- it's not like we don't do that, and they have their -- or if you send the money from one bank to other bank, it's kind of a private label. But they choose us. Customers choose us because they prefer to send money from U.S. to Vietnam or from Finland to Argentina in minutes, and that's what we provide, and that's our beauty in crossing the borders. I don't see -- within the environment, we do have a pretty good business model, I guess.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then I'm just wondering, have you seen the impact of the compliance on other regional companies? It seems as though you've spent a lot of money on compliance because you're the largest. Are you starting to see that trickle down to some of your other competitors that might be a little bit smaller?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, I can't speak name of them, but I know that we are investing a lot, and I believe it's going to be a competitive advantage. I only can tell some -- in some countries, as I mentioned earlier, that we do see some people saying that we are -- or we can't invest in this business. There's obviously companies like Western Union, who has the right compliance program or investing in the current compliance, upgrade their compliance programs. And that brings us definitely customers. My example was Mexico. We see there. But generally, I would say that my hope is that it's good for the industry that everybody invests here and invests significantly here and do a good business here. And that's what we do. We believe that we are investing in the right way. And to comply with the regulations and being -- having a good compliance program.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And I know, Raj, this might be a little early. But when you had indicated the increase in compliance, one of the things that I think you said is you're hoping to automate some of the processes so that maybe you can control the compliance costs a little bit more. Is -- have you looked at that? Is that an opportunity? Or is it just still too early to tell what you might be able to do in terms of automating and connect-controlling that compliance pause [ph] as we go forward?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Hey, Kartik. It is early, but we're always looking for opportunities to automate our processes. That's an ongoing initiative for us. Our goal in the short term is to get the programs and processes in place. But longer term, it is to automate, and that's where some of the technology spending comes into play, that our CapEx is expected to be about 5% of revenues this year, which is a little bit higher than the last couple of years, and that's part of the reason. So we are trying to automate those things as much as we can, and we learn as well over time.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I think compliance and compliance optimization is one of the highest programs we have in the company. We have an executive who is only focused on that to upgrade that, to do it in a best way. That's why we invest here, and we believe it's going to be long-term a competitive advantages. It will be automated everything, and we believe that we will have the -- we -- aim to have the best-in-class one.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "My question's around wu.com and the strategy there a little bit just with regard to, I guess, a few different initiatives, at least rumors of which have been bandied about. One would be instant ACH and your outlook for offering instant ACH, and which markets do you think that's the most attractive. And then second, I think, Hikmet, did I hear you say that about 30% of wu.com transactions are mobile? I guess I'd like to hear a little bit about the mobile strategy, too? And how important you think that is and thoughts around new mobile apps and so forth? So just kind of focusing on -- in on how you view that business and those offerings evolving here over the next several years.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Raj, do you want to take the first part? And I'll take the mobile part.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Hey, yes. Andrew, let me just talk about instant ACH. We were very happy with the results in wu.com, and that business is doing some great things. We operate in 24 markets around the world, where we send money from into 200 countries and territories into cash or to retail locations, and then we can also send money into a bank account in 50 markets around the world. And you've already seen the success that, that business is having with the customer experience, adding more customers to the mix, as well as the distribution expansion. So we're doing a lot of great things already in that business. And from our perspective, instant ACH is going to be another feature that our customers will want, and we'll add that later this year. We have an ACH product in the U.S. today. It's on a 4-day basis. And we have similar bank funding mechanisms in a few other countries, and we're expanding that on an ongoing basis. So throughout instant ACH, it is important to add later this year, but it's not the only thing that's going to drive this business. Clearly, we're already having a lot success around that. And then, Hikmet, I'll give it to you for the [indiscernible].", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. Just to complete on the ACH program. As you said, there are different ACH program around the world, right? In Germany, an ACH sounds different like a direct debit from your account than in France and then in the U.S. So -- and being into -- that's the beauty of being in 24 countries, right, and expanding our portfolio. I mean, long term, I want to be with Digital in 200 countries. A big part of that, that's the second part of your question, is the mobile. I believe on the mobile. I think it's the future is that people sending money instantly from their mobile phone and receiving on their mobile phone, and we've been with our Western Union apps in the U.S., very successful, 30% of the transactions are already on mobile. And the people do use fast money sending from their mobile, and I think it's going to be a growing area. I'm going to continue to look at that. And we're going to have -- continue to evolve -- involve to invest more on the mobile to sending money. But don't forget, in the end of today, you need the Western Union fundamentals. You need the operation. We have 100 -- we payout in 121 currencies. Not many companies can do that in minutes. Not many companies do that. We have operational excellence. In the middle, we have the compliance programs. Not many companies can combine worldwide hybrid economies, sending money from your iPad in minutes to rural areas of Bihar in India. We can do that, drop money in rupees in minutes. I think -- and that's -- adding on that mobile function is, I think, a very important part of my strategy.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is it -- for how long, I guess, do you see not specifically, but conceptually, would you see or be willing to do things like subsidize interchange and so forth to drive volume? Is there a -- as that business grows faster and gets bigger, is there a sensitivity to sort of the incremental costs in that versus the lower cost, but still somewhat slower and maybe riskier, hence more expensive ACH network?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Andrew, we're evaluating all different options. It's a balance of continuing the success that we've had and then looking at new funding options. We're doing that in many markets, and we'll do that in the U.S. as well. But we want to manage the risk around the instant ACH product, which you really have to manage well. But if you can get the formula right, it can be a nice growth driver. So we're managing all that. We'll look at all the options there.", "Michael A. Salop", "And Andrew, we typically have different prices in different corridors, as you can imagine. But where we can, we often have higher fees for credit card funding as opposed to bank funding, so more of the promotional is driving to the lower cost bank funding.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it sort of depends on which area you were talking about?", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes.", "Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last, Hikmet, it sounded like last quarter, you were kind of getting away from highlighting the agent count, perhaps trying to rationalize the agent base. Could you give us an update there? And kind of -- are were thinking -- should we be thinking about directionally more agent concentration rather than less over time?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No. You should think more that, we're going to get more agent locations and more distribution and more ATMs. I'm still driving to my teams to do more touch points. And it could be agent locations. It could be ATMs. It could be a sales kiosk. And I think that's going to expand. What we have done is also -- we also leaned back a little bit, looked at the agent productivity over a few quarters. And found they're saying that, \"Okay. We want to have more revenue, more transaction on the send side from the agent transactions and we focus on that.\" And the secret of that business is also that you have to be in every corner, and I would like to see a Western Union brand in every corner of the world. Is it on an ATM? Is it on a location? Because it's then easy to combine a mobile phone from Denver here to worldwide, any location, rural areas of Vietnam or rural areas of Ukraine or in Turkey to a location. And if you don't have the locations or if you don't have the sales kiosk or if you don't have the ATMs, you can't do that. So my strategy will continue to push my team to expand our distribution channels.", "Michael A. Salop", "Laura, we'll take one more call.", "Operator", "The last question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "It looks like your transactions actually increased for the first time in awhile. Any thoughts on that? Principal per transaction was up modestly just as we think about that over the course of '14.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we had already the strong transaction growth, but [indiscernible].", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. Principal per transaction was flat on a constant currency basis. Is that what you were referring to Kevin or...", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Yes, yes. As opposed to -- do you think we're at an inflection point, I think that's actually a pretty big positive as opposed to kind of the declines you've been seeing the last couple of years.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "I think it's really just related to mix and what might change in the businesses. It's hard to predict exactly where that's going to be, but we're pleased with that result. But I think it's mostly just related to mix.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Got it. And then if you said this, I apologize. But are we still on target for the $500 million by 2015?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. We still have the approximately $500 million as a target. The team and everybody is focused at reaching the approximately $500 million, and I think we are -- have a very strong growth, 45% revenue growth, convince me that we are on that direction.", "Michael A. Salop", "That was a $500 million target for our Digital business just to clarify. So everybody, thanks for joining us for the call and have a good afternoon.", "Rajesh K.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's second quarter 2014 results and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2013 Form 10-K, for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we'll discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Overall, the first half results are generally in line with our expectations coming into the year, and we are pleased to be able to narrow the full year operating profit margin and earnings per share outlooks to the higher end of the previous ranges.", "The strategic actions we have implemented in consumer money transfer over the last couple of years, including pricing adjustments in key corridors and digital expansion, have helped turn the business back to positive revenue growth in the first half of 2014.", "Our productivity initiatives are also contributing to results as we have maintained a 20% margin in the first half, despite cost pressure in some key areas. And we continue to generate and deploy strong cash flow for our shareholders, with over $200 million of share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. For the first half of the year, we have now returned over $450 million to shareholders.", "In the quarter, revenue increased 1% or 3% in constant currency terms. Our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue increased 2% or 3% constant currency, driven by both improvement in cash initiative retail Money Transfer and continued strong growth from westernunion.com.", "Trends have been aided by our previous pricing actions, but we are also seeing growth in nonprice corridors. We have made adjustments to address our value proposition in the key corridors, and we do not believe significant additional pricing reductions are needed this year.", "The impact of pricing in the second quarter was only 1% of revenue, although reported revenue was also negatively impacted by currency and some geographic mix differences compared to last year.", "We continue to make progress with westernunion.com, including risk management enhancement in the U.S., the launch of mobile experience in the U.K., the addition of bank account funding options in several European countries and direct-to-bank actions in new markets.", "We are acquiring new online customers at a fast rate as well as increasing customer retention. However, based on our latest customer comp projections and the timing of new service rollouts, we no longer expect the acceleration in trends to be as steep as we previously anticipated. As a result, our $500 million revenue target for digital is being pushed out beyond 2015.", "Digital, which includes westernunion.com and Mobile Money Transfer, is still an area that is generating strong growth. Our strategies are working, and westernunion.com online money transfer revenues increased 31% in the quarter and are up 38% on a year-to-date basis. We expect the digital business to continue to be a long-term growth driver for Western Union.", "Western Union Business Solutions' revenue was flat in the quarter, which follows 3 straight quarters of double-digit constant currency growth. We believe customers' activity was impacted by extremely low foreign exchange volatility in the quarter and some sales execution challenges. On the year-to-date basis through June, Business Solutions' constant currency revenue increased 5%, which is roughly in line with global trade projections. Although we continue to believe it is a strong long-term growth opportunity, considering the current lower foreign exchange volatility in the market, we do not believe we will reach the full year double-digit revenue growth target for Business Solutions in 2014.", "For the total company, however, based on our first half performance and forecast for the remainder of the year, we have affirmed our 2014 revenue outlook. We have narrowed our operating margin outlook to approximately 19.5% to 20%, which is at the higher end of the previous range. As a result, I am pleased to report we have also narrowed our earnings per share outlook to $1.45 to $1.50, also at the higher end of the previous range.", "As we look to the second half of the year and the future, we remain focused on strengthening consumer money transfer with an emphasis on digital expansion, growing Western Union Business Solutions and generating and developing strong cash flow for our shareholders. We believe long-term growth will be driven by digital, C2C and Business Solutions but also with lower but steady growth rates from the cash initiative C2C.", "In consumer money transfer, we expect cash payout at our global agent locations and ATMs to still be extremely important for our receivers, and we plan to continue expanding our account payout options to bring new customers to our business.", "Increasing our network through both strategic retail agents and more digital connection is also important part of our strategy. In Business Solutions, we plan to continue to increase our integrated product offerings and expand our customers base to drive business in a strong long-term growth market. And of course, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and deploy it for our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.", "Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am with a couple of key additions to our team that we announced earlier this month. We are very proud to add Robert Selander, former CEO of MasterCard, to the Western Union Board of Directors. Rob brings a wealth of business and financial service experience to our board, and we are looking forward to benefiting from his payment expertise. And as you are aware, Raj Agrawal was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after serving in the role on an interim basis since the beginning of the year. Raj has demonstrated to me and to our Board of Directors that he was the right choice for this position. He's a strong leader with a diverse financial and business background, and he has deep knowledge of our business. So, Raj, I would like to now welcome you officially to this role, and I would like to ask to give more detail on the second quarter.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Thank you, Hikmet, and I am very pleased to be named in this role, and I look forward to meeting more of the investment community in the coming months.", "So let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. Total revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 1% or 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year.", "Electronic channels revenue increased 27% in the quarter and represented 6% of total company revenue.", "In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue increased 2% or 3% on a constant currency basis. Total transactions increased 6% in the quarter, which benefited from our previously implemented pricing and other strategic actions in key corridors and strong growth in westernunion.com.", "Western Union C2C cross-border principal increased 7% in the second quarter or 6% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction was flat compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, we expected C2C transaction growth rates to come down from the 9% levels we saw the last 3 quarters as we moved further away from the pricing-driven lift, but the pricing impact on revenue has narrowed.", "The spread between the C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 4 percentage points, including a negative 1% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1% in the quarter, while mix had a negative impact of approximately 2%. Mix was negatively impacted by growth in some lower revenue per transaction geographies and the reduction in business and some high revenue per transaction corridors. We continue to anticipate 2014 pricing actions to be modest.", "Turning to the regions. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 3% year-over-year, including a positive 1% impact from currency, with Germany continuing to deliver strong growth. Transactions in the region increased 11% and benefited from the pricing actions implemented in 2013.", "North America revenue grew 1% in the quarter, while transactions increased 3%. U.S. outbound continue to deliver good growth, while Mexico revenue grew 2% on a transaction increase of 3% in the quarter.", "Domestic money transfer trends were similar to the first quarter, with revenue increasing 1% and transactions growing 6%.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue and transactions each increased 6% compared with the year-ago quarter, with no impact from currency. Strong revenue growth from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates drove the region's increase, and we are pleased that we recently renewed a multiyear agreement with Bank Albilad in Saudi Arabia, one of our largest global agents.", "In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 1%, including a negative 1% impact from currency, and transactions increased 3%. Revenue benefited primarily from strong growth in Japan and further increases from the Philippines.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region revenue was down 13% from their prior year period, including a negative a 6% impact from currency, and transactions were flat. The currency impact was primarily due to the weak Argentina peso, while constant currency revenue was negatively impacted by government-imposed restrictions on the market in Venezuela.", "Westernunion.com delivered strong C2C revenue growth of 31% in the quarter while transactions increased 46%. U.S.-originated online transactions also grew 46%.", "Wu.com continue to benefit from very strong revenue growth in several key corridors, including U.S. outbound to India, the Philippines and Mexico. U.S. domestic money transfer and U.K. to India. In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 5% in the quarter but increased 8% on a constant currency basis. The differential between the reported and constant currency rates was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso.", "On a constant currency basis, the South America businesses continue to grow while in the U.S. increases in electric bill payments were offset by declines in cash walk-in business. Business Solutions revenue was flat on a reported and constant currency basis and represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The second quarter GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 20% in the prior year period. The margin was negatively impacted by higher average C2C retail commission rates, higher interchange costs in consumer bill payments and the impact of currency and benefited from cost savings initiatives and lower integration costs. Compliance expense in the second quarter was approximately 3% of revenue. We continue to expect cost to ramp in the second half of the year, but we do appear to be in good shape to be -- toward the lower end of our 3.5% to 4% full year outlook.", "The benefits from cost savings initiatives relate to comparisons with cost in the second quarter of last year when we incurred $20 million of expenses related to the combination of cost savings initiatives and Travelex Global Business Payments integration. We also achieved just over $10 million of incremental cost savings in this year's second quarter and continue to expect approximately $45 million in incremental savings for the full year.", "EBITDA margin was 24.7% in the quarter compared to 24.8% a year ago. Our tax rate was 16.5% in the second quarter, and we continue to expect a full year rate of around 15%.", "Reported earnings per share in the quarter was $0.36, which is the same as the prior year period. The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7%, down from 23.2% in the prior year period, primarily due to higher average retail commission rates and the negative impact of currency, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives.", "The Consumer-to-Consumer operating margin declined primarily due to higher funding costs related to increased interchange expense, driven by increased credit card usage by our U.S. electronic bill payments customers. The second quarter C2B margin was 16.2%, which compared to 20.5% in the prior year period.", "Business Solutions reported an operating loss of $3 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $7 million for the same period last year. Both quarters included depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million. The reduction in operating loss was due primarily to lower integration expense compared to the prior year period.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $450 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million in the second quarter, and for the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately 4% to 5% of revenue. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.8 billion and cash of $1.6 billion. Approximately 25% of the cash was held by United States entities.", "During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 9 million shares for a total of $143 million, and we paid $66 million in dividends. Year-to-date through June, we have returned $457 million to shareholders. At quarter end, we had 530 million shares outstanding and $177 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires June 2015.", "As Hikmet mentioned, based on our first half performance and current forecast for the remainder of the year, we are affirming the full year revenue outlook, and we are nearing the operating profit margin and EPS outlooks to the high end of the previous ranges. We now expect the operating profit margin to be in a range of approximately 19.5% to 20% and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.50. We have also adjusted our expected cash flow from operating activities to approximately $1 billion. Our previous forecast of approximately $900 million included $100 million of anticipated tax payments related to our 2011 IRS agreement, which are now expected to be made in future years.", "So to summarize, our first half results were in line with our expectations, and we believe full year profit margin and earnings per share will be at the higher end of the previous outlook ranges.", "That concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just want to ask about a few corridors. It looked like Europe and the CIS region again was pretty strong; it up ticked in the quarter. And then on the other -- on the flip side, APAC and Latin America region looked like it down ticked a little bit. Maybe you can just talk about what's going on there?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure. Bryan, this is Raj. On Europe and CIS, we anniversary-ed most of the pricing actions through the first quarter of this year, but we did have some additional pricings in the second quarter of last year. And so we're still seeing the benefit of some of the pricing actions. And having said that, we also continue to see good growth from Germany and some other markets. So Europe overall is doing well for us.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Also Russia was good for us.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Russia was also good for us. We had good transaction growth there. For APAC, Philippines was a good contributor to us, but it did slow down a little bit in the market, but overall it was about flat quarter-to-quarter.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And India deliver, Bryan, good revenue, transaction growth, especially also from online corridors. We were pleased with our westernunion.com to India.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. And then LATA. There are couple of things that are going on in the LATA market. Argentina, on a reported basis, Argentina is cause of the lower reported revenue numbers because of the currency devaluation of the peso. The peso is about 35% weaker than it was about a year ago. And then, when you look at the business on a constant currency basis, Venezuela has imposed a restriction on the entire market in terms of capital flows to Colombia, which is our primary corridor there, so we were impacted there. That corridor has basically shut down, so we did lose that part of the business. We haven't assumed that the business is going to come back the rest of this year. We expect that at some point the business will come back, but we've made an assumption that it's not coming back to us at least this year.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question for me on the margin. Just outside of C2C, what is the margin outlook, I guess, in the C2B and the Business Solutions going forward? How should we think about the margins?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "For C2B, we were impacted this quarter by higher interchange costs in the -- we had consumers using more credit cards. Over the last 12 months, we've been expanding our payment options with our billers and with new billers that we bring on, and credit card is a key requirement there. Clearly, that's in an effort to drive revenue growth there, but we also saw higher costs. So that's something that we're trying to address but...", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's also an industry trend what I understand too.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, we see just an industry shift towards more consumers using credit cards. So we're not going to able to fix that overnight, but it is something that we do believe we have some solutions to handle and to address this year. And in terms of the B2B business, the profitability is about at the same level as last year's quarter. We had some higher compliance costs in the quarter that were above where we would have normally had the business. I do believe that the business will expand margins over the next few years in that business because we need to get the revenue leverage, and we didn't revenue growth in the quarter. But as we get revenue leverage, we will be able to expand margins in that business as we can leverage the infrastructure that we've already put in place. So I would look for greater margins over the next few years in that business.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But for the second half of this year, the margin should be pretty similar to what we saw in both segments to the second quarter? Or should it be different?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "I think on the payments business our key issue that we're dealing with is the higher interchange costs. I don't really have a view for you on that one. That's really higher than we had expected this year. So it's hard to say exactly when we'll get that solved, but we are addressing that. On the B2B business, I would look for improvements. I can't tell you what it'll be exactly in the second half, but I would look for improvements over the next 12 months in the margins there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Hikmet, could you just talk a little bit about the digital business. I know you said that you're no longer looking for that $500 million bogey that you have left. Kind of just talk about where do you stand?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I think we are very pleased with our digital business. Last quarter we grew 31% of revenue, year-to-date about 38%, even the transactions growth about 46%, so we are very pleased with the momentum. We are also pleased with the customer acquisition. As you know that we put out the targets on the customer acquisition. The new customer acquisition brings revenue for the future. And the customer acquisition target is not accelerating is not, is not as steep as we thought in the last few months, but we are very optimistic. It's a very focused business. The main growth in the future will -- for Western Union will continue to come from our digital business. We are in 23 countries, dropping money to 200 countries, and our expansion policy continues. Our expansion strategy continues. So only the new customer acquisition has not been at the acceleration rate that we thought, and that's why we come back from the $500 million 2015, which was a target we set.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. And Kartik, I'll just add that the business continues to perform really well. I mean we had great growth in the quarter and the -- pushing the target back for next year is not really about this year's performance. It's really the acceleration that we needed from here on out. Going into next year was our primary concern, and that's why we've pushed that number back beyond next year. But the business is performing really well and really improving on various metrics.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "Does this changed at all your outlook for the profitability of the business because revenues are going out? Or does it in fact maybe make the business more profitable quicker?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "No, I would say generally it does not change the outlook on profitability of the business. For us, we've always believed and still continue to believe that as the business scales and gains leverage we'll be able to grow the profitability of that business. We're spending a disproportionate amount in both marketing and technology in that business, but we won't need to keep spending at that level. Right now, the focus has been on spending so that we can drive that revenue growth, and we're still getting really good revenue growth in that business.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And also add on that, Kartik, as you recall, last time you asked the question, but the funding methods from the send side with the credit card will be less, so interchange fees long term will be less. There'll be more account-based money transfer and more direct ACH. And also, in Europe we have the direct support, and all these things will help to bring the interchange fees down. And on the send side, we don't have the agent commissions. So long term, I'm quite confident about the profitability of this business.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research", "And then just one last question, Raj. You've done a very good job bringing cash back and returning capital to shareholders. How long -- or with the process you have in place, how long can you continue to bring cash back and continue returning that to shareholders?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Kartik, we focused on that quite a bit as you can imagine. We're pleased with the current program we have, which goes through middle of next year. It's a $500 million program, and we still have about $180 million left on that program. As we said before, and this is still what I believe to be true, is that we do believe we have options to bring additional cash back over the next few years in some similar manner as we put our programs in place internally for intercompany working capital programs. So I believe we can continue to bring cash back and keep returning cash both in the form of dividend and stock buyback.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Raj, congrats on the title. I'll ask on the Business Solutions side. I heard sales execution was an issue. How quick a fix can that be? And can you just elaborate on that. And just the very low effect of volatility, I know you've heard that from a few firms now. Can you quantify the impact there and how that might -- what the sensitivity is in the future?", "Hikmet Ersek", "You want to -- why don't we [indiscernible]...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, let me start with the -- thanks, Hikmet. Let me start with the volatility question first, and I'll give it to Hikmet on the sales part. On the volatility part of the business, the outlook for the -- first of all, our strategy for the business hasn't changed. We still believe that this is going to be a good grower for Western Union, contribute well to our overall growth. But when you look at the volatility, as well as it was, it was at a multiyear low and continues to be at a low level, putting today aside for a moment. Our customers begin to change their behavior because our business is made up of hedging, foreign exchange, risk management and then we also have other payment transactions that happen. So when you feel more comfortable with the transaction or when you feel more comfortable with where currencies are, you are less likely to move off the sidelines and do a transaction. Now ultimately over the course of 1 year or over 2 years, you will actually have to do the transaction, so it's really a short-term issue. Over the course of 1 year or 2 years, we would not expect volatility to have that much of an impact to the business. It's really in a very short period of time when you have such a dramatic move in the volatility level then we do see that impact.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Exactly. The volatility also impacts our sales execution contingent [ph] because the people are not trading that easy. It's hard to sell that, and plus on that, during the integration process we also changed some salespeople. We have a new sales organization. That has also impacted. Saying that though, on the nonforeign exchange trading business, on the payments part, like universities and like in due [ph] payments, we've been executing pretty well there. So new sales, new payments part of the cross-border will be as the transaction has been executed very well. But on the existing core business, we had given lower foreign exchange and other integration shows we had a little bit sales execution issue.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I see, I see. So if FX also stays low here, I mean -- I guess we should still assume it to be sort of muted growth for the -- maybe for the balance of the year. But it sound like you're still confident in double-digit longer term?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, we feel confident in double-digit longer term. I think the volatility it's hard to predict where that's going to be. Ultimately, customers have to do transactions. But when we achieve a flat growth, it does take a little bit of time to come back from that.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, understood. One more for me. Just on C2C everything looks very much in line, everything looks good there. Just the modest pricing outlook was comforting. Just wanted to clarify. So Walmart-2-Walmart, I guess hasn't been an issue. I mean also just thinking about some of the geopolitical things out there. Russia, you said was good. I know Israel some -- it's obviously some activity there. Just curious, if any of that could have been reflected in your guidance in any way?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think we are quite comfortable with our guidance on the revenue outlook, Tien-tsin, on the -- particularly on the domestic money transfer, revenues were up 1%. Transactions were up 6%. The delta, as you know, Tien-tsin, is the -- because our -- it's basically mixed because our lower band transaction have been growing faster than on the higher band transaction. I will say that with our 46,000 locations all over the nation in the U.S. the customers are continuing to use the ABMT business. So I'm -- especially also on the very strong westernunion.com., electronic DMT is going very strong with mobile, the people are -- who use their mobile phones to send transactions in the lower band, so I'm pleased on that part. The other, on Russia and on Israel and other parts of the world, I would say, generally -- as you know, we operate in 200 countries. We definitely have every day somewhere, something. Over the last 14 years, I've seen so many things; and being in 200 countries, that helps a lot. We have diversified portfolio. None of our countries out of the U.S. is bigger than 6% of our revenue, and that diversification helped. On Russia, I would say that our actions we have put took place about 18 months ago, the price promotions, especially to CIS countries and other outbound countries helped a lot to turn around this business. And the delta between revenue and transaction became closer, so that's also pretty well-executed there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Listen, I just want to touch again on pricing. It's good to hear you mentioned that pricing changes should be about done for the year, if I heard that correctly. When we look at the revenue per transaction I mean it dropped sequentially, and I guess that's sort of been the trend as we've seen from the -- ever since you made the pricing drops. Should we now expect that to stabilize somewhat going forward given that -- given your comments? So revenue per transaction going forward or other impacts to that, that we should keep in mind? And just, Hikmet, on a higher level maybe, if we think about pricing going forward now. You obviously made a big change. It had a successful impact of really showing elasticity to transaction growth. Going forward, can you give us some more advice, I know we've talked about it in the past quarters, as to how we should think about pricing in 2015 and really just longer term with where the business model looks like it's responding today?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Let me try to answer the longer term because, as you know, we don't give long-term guidance, '15 guidance, but let me understand -- directionally maybe, I can give you, Darrin, an overview. First of all, you're right. I think -- I'm not planning big pricing actions coming on the '14. I'm pretty comfortable with our projection, with our revenue projections. The impact where you see here is that they're mainly mixed. It's a band mix and the corridor mix. We see very strong growth in, for instance, in DMT, as I mentioned earlier to Tien-tsin's question on the lower bands, on the DMT, on the Mobile Money Transfer and also and some corridors are growing which are with a lower band --lower RPT faster than on a higher RPT corridor. That has been the case. The mix has impacted are part of it. But long term, I would say that, I think, we're going to not change our strategy. We're going to look at corridor by corridor,. We will always have a competition there on the market. We will -- especially corridors especially. It's a very competitive market, but we believe that we are very well positioned with our corridor-by-corridor pricing actions, and we will continue to drive the revenue. We are focused on the revenue growth,. We are focused on the operating profit growth, and that's going to continue.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just I guess with respect to looking at the next couple of quarters in terms of modeling, from a revenue-per-transaction basis I mean maybe if, Raj, you can just give us -- is there any other moving parts we should just keep in mind maybe besides pure pricing?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Well, I mean, the things that you should just think about our -- 3 things that can impact RPT are certainly pricing. We're not planning on any major pricing, but they'll be some just normal level of pricing. There'll be some mix impacts, and then you typically will have some currency impact as well. So those are the kinds of things that you should think about as you move forward.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. That's helpful. Just this one follow-up and I'll turn it back to the queue, if you don't mind. On the gross margins side, I mean that's been pretty stable for a while now. We've heard some discussion in the industry around more competition for exclusivity around the agents. So I mean can you give us a little color? Are you seeing any signs of that in the sense of other -- of your competitors really trying to go after breaking more exclusivity up and potentially turn off or higher commissions to agents in the market? Or is that really just -- are you able to really use your brand and hold off -- hold that off of from happening?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think this is really a pressure from the competition. They are going with higher commissions, with higher signing bonuses and everything. But, Darrin, you know this business. Most of our agents has been very loyal, especially send site. The top 40 agents have been loyal for us the last 17 years exclusive basis. They feel comfortable when they promote our brand with us. They feel comfortable. But, Darrin, case-by-case, we do have competition there. But I feel comfortable that we will continue to have our agent network keeping -- and our network exclusive and continue to have that environment.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. One on just a modeling question, if I could, Raj. In terms of quarterly run rate for interest expense, which dropped down I think a couple of million dollars this quarter, is that a new number we should use? I know it's probably not huge at the bottom line. I'm just trying to make sure I understand how that'll look over the next several quarters and into next year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, on interest expense, specifically, we -- as you know, we refinanced some debt in the first quarter of this year. We retired debt that was at 6.5%, and we issued some floating rate notes as well as some other term debt, so it was at a much lower interest rate, so that's having a positive impact. If you look at the other income expense line in total, we have some offsets there for FX losses on our -- related Argentina, so just look at those items in total. But yes, the interest expense should be lower than it was on that specific line item.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then the other question I had is, I guess it was a handful of weeks ago there were some stories about banks sort of throwing in the towel on money transfer. And I know from a direct perspective, that's obviously good news for you guys. I've been talking with other people. There's -- I've also heard people say that banks might stop supporting other money transfer companies to just rid themselves of any exposure to the industry. I know you guys have talked a lot about compliance as a competitive advantage. I mean anything you would say around those comments and those stories that gives you even more confidence? Are you seeing as you look deeper into the competitive landscape that, that's sort of starting to absolutely happen or be talked about where smaller guys are losing bank partnerships on top of banks just getting out of the business?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Tim, I want my money back, and compliance is an investment we believe that will pay back. And 3.5% to 4% of our revenue, and we believe that it's a good investment. And it shows already some good signs that some banks or some other competitors are getting out of this business, and we do see some market share gain in some markets, not overall. In 1 or 2 markets, we started to see that, and it helps our -- banks not serving us, I don't know. I think it's about working together. Don't forget 75% of our network globally are banks and financial institutions, and they do see -- one of our biggest agents is La Banque Postale in France. And we've been together working more than 25 years worldwide with them, and they are very pleased with our programs, and we do share our compliance programs with them. And I think we have a good business model that they're going continue to work. On the competition, I can't give a comment here. I don't know how their compliance programs are, but I think our existing agents are happy with us.", "Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I mean, I guess, where I was coming at from Hikmet, is clearly you guys are good partners with banks. I'm thinking more along the lines that there are lots of smaller players throughout this industry, as you know, that use banks for their banking services and partnerships around money flow. Do you think that those sort of second- and third-tier players in money transfer might find it harder to have -- to find banks that will work with them as a vendor and sort of a money transmitter partner, not necessarily an agent but just sort of say, \"You know what, we want to rid ourselves of compliance risk, reputational risk. We will not be banking money transfer companies as a partner\"?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Short answer is, yes, I do see that long term, and I saw it in some markets. And the short answer is, yes, they will have -- law enforcement will also ask them to implement all these programs. I think, yes. The answer is, yes. That will be hard for them.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to go back to the discussion about commissions. Commission expense has increased for the past few quarters given agent renewals. And I'm wondering how we should think about that expense as a percent of revenue going forward? And whether or not there are any large agent renewals coming up in the next couple of quarters?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Hey, Sara, this is Raj. Yes, the -- in terms of renewals, generally, we'll have -- the contracts are typically 5 years in maturity. So in any given year, you might have 20% renewals. But you're not always going to have all the lumpy renewals every single year. So from a retail commission standpoint, yes, we've had some pressure. Our opportunity more broadly is about reducing overall distribution costs as we grow and change the mix of our business. So as we have more bank account type options, funding and sending to bank account and as we grow our digital business, that overall distribution costs should go lower. We also have the opportunity as we bring in new agents to bring them in at a lower overall commission rate. Now that doesn't have an impact right away, but it does have an impact longer term, so that's really the way we think about it. We have had success in managing commission, retail commission rates in the past, and we're, obviously, very focused on that. But at the same time, we want to balance the larger renewals. That's something that we're not prepared to lose. So that's the way we think about it in terms of overall distribution costs.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then separately just on the compliance initiative, can you give as an update on where you are in implementation?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. We're making progress. We have -- we expect the spending in the compliance area will be a little bit higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. As you know, we indicated last time that we plan to have about 2,000 people in the compliance organization by early next year, and we are deep into that hiring process, and so those costs will ramp up as we move into the second half. We're making progress on the overall implementation of the various programs, KYC programs, KYA programs and overall processes that we need to put in place. So we feel good about the progress we're making. We have a multiyear implementation plan, and we're all along that plan.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess my first question was, on the digital side when you say new customer acquisition rate is down, is that a question of you needing to maybe spend more? Are certain corridors tapped out? Is it more competition from other sources? What's going on there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, no, it's not down, Ashwin. I just want to correct that. Once again, I want to be very clear. It's not down. It's even growing very fast pace, but acceleration, which we were planning, right, for future, it's not as steep as we wanted to have it. Once again, I just want to be very clear. We are very pleased with our acquisition. We are pleased with our revenues. We are pleased with our transaction numbers, and the new customers are coming; 80% of the customers are new to the network. So all our surges [ph] are working. But we had good targets, and the targets are -- was higher acceleration coming over the months, and this is not at that number as we would like to...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, we're acquiring customers at an extremely fast pace. We're also -- we have a fast rate of activation of customers. We're converting more customers, improving retention. But as Hikmet mentioned, the acceleration that's required the rest of this year, we don't see that coming at this stage. We're still working through that and are driving for the best result there, but we -- that's why we pushed that target back.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. No, what I meant was I mean your growth rate has dropped from -- what was it -- 65% in 4Q to 55% to 46%. And that's what I meant. I didn't -- that's what I meant. I mean in terms -- is that law [ph] of large numbers and what's going on? That's what I wanted, try to drill down, but we can talk about that offline. I guess, on the -- back to the compliance. Raj, you did mention 3.5% to 4%. You will be at these lower end of that range this year or near?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And is that because you're being successful in implementing certain things? Or is that a pushout into next year which -- is that also at a similar level, 3.5% to 4%?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Ashwin, it's really the result -- we're making progress, as I had mentioned, on the key activities there of putting actions and processes in place. The ramp-up of the hiring is really coming in the second half of the year, so we see the spending ramping up in the second half of the year. Now there could be some spillage between years, between this year and next year; but overall, we feel good about the range for next year, which is the 3.5% to 4%. That's -- based on what we know today, that's still a good range for next year. And depending on how the specific items that we complete this year, that'll help us get more specific on in terms of where that's going to be next year.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Ashwin, if you allow me. One thing I will admit, we use the opportunity on compliance. Also mentioned that in this call is that we do see the impact of revenue impact on the higher band. All the programs we implemented in our programs. As you know, we went out there. We said we're going to do that compliance. We could create a culture of compliance. And we do see the impact on that, especially on the higher band, and it impacts our revenue growth. But long term, I believe, back to Tim's question, that will be a competitive advantage because I believe that we are going to be ahead of the competition.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, and from a -- just a cost standpoint, obviously, we're trying to do things as efficiently as we can. So initially, the focus has been on hiring people, getting things completed. But then, longer term, we want to put technology in place. We want to get efficiencies out of the spending that we are doing.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And on SG&A, I guess pretty good controls this quarter, and that was in spite of the World Cup spending. I don't know how material that was or is that going to have an impact in either 2Q or 3Q. Is there something that we should take into account or is that not material?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, it was -- we did not spend on World Cup. We had a small promotion for some loyal customers, agent. But we did not spend anything on World Cup. It was maybe on Euro Cup you are mentioning, in Euro Cup, and that's a multiyear program, that's included in our marketing expenses. In our normal expenses, it's forecasted, so -- it's nothing. So I think the team did a good job. As you know, we announced some cost savings initiatives, and we are executing against that, and that has been reflected in Q2.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Can I sneak in a last question on the $100 million tax payment that got pushed out, any explanation on that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. It's really a question of timing, Ashwin. We had planned on that payment being in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter this year. And there are just some outstanding items that are unrelated to that, that impact the timing of it, but we plan to make those payments starting next year. So it's really just a question of timing. Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "S.K. Prasad Borra", "This is S.K. Prasad Borra on behalf of Jim Schneider. Can you elaborate a bit more on your compliance costs, especially as you head into 2015, how would that pan out?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, our plan right now, S.K., is that we would -- we believe that the range for next year is still the 3.5% to 4%. Again, we don't have more detail behind that at this early stage. But based on the spending that we're doing this year, the programs we're putting in place, we believe that the range at this stage is 3.5% to 4%.", "S.K. Prasad Borra", "Okay. And you mentioned that it's going to be a sequential increase in the compliance costs heading into second half. Is it just more headcount related? Or is investments heavily geared to technology as well?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "It's all of the above, so it's headcount related. It's other programs. It's technology. The spending is split roughly half for people and then the other half is between technology and outside services. So it's a mix of all of those.", "Operator", "And that question will come from David Togut of Evercore.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "This is Rayna Kumar for David. Could you please discuss your plans for an instant ACH cross-border money transfer product, maybe tell us a little bit more about the timing and pricing?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, absolutely. And Rayna, you're talking about the -- really primarily the U.S. When we look at our business, instant ACH is one of the many things that we're introducing or going to introduce. We're doing a lot of great things in the business, and I don't want to lose sight of that. We are global in scope. We have many products and services and features that we're enhancing to improve the overall customer experience. We're adding many more customers to the franchise, even in our current business. And we're also expanding our distribution, so more bank account funding and payout options. Instant ACH is going to help, but it's not the only thing that's going to drive our business. So our plan is to introduce that later this year. And we're testing that as we speak with a couple of thousand people, but we will introduce it more formally and more broadly to other U.S. customers later this year.", "Hikmet Ersek", "It's only for the U.S. corridor, and it's a part of our business. So it's also how much risk you want to take, right? We are quite confident and quite happy with our growth rates, 31% revenue with less risk. That's a good growth and good help for the margin. But we do also -- huge growth comes from Europe outbound on .com, and we do have their direct debit capabilities, support capabilities, which helps us to drop money immediately.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "How should we think about pricing for this product? And what specific corridors from the U.S. will it be initially introduced to?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, we do already have ACH.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, we have ACH right now, which is a 4-day product. Instant ACH will just be an expansion of that. Our ultimate goal is to have that available for many of the corridors in which we operate but...", "Hikmet Ersek", "You can drop money with -- today's ACH, you can drop money to 200 countries, no problem. The question is, how do you fund that? So we serve, despite the competition, to 200 countries already with our ACH. The question is, when do you do the instant ACH? How much risk you take it? Currently, we are quite satisfied with our customer response, so -- I think and also satisfied with our growth rates.", "Michael A. Salop", "Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We want to wish you a good afternoon, and we'll talk to you next time.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The conference has now concluded.

Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thank you, Laura and good afternoon everyone. On today's call Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's third quarter 2014 results, and then we will take your questions.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with the results we delivered in the third quarter. Our transformational strategy and innovation actions that we put in place a couple of years ago are delivering good results. In the quarter, we continued to make progress strengthening our consumer money transfer business. We returned to growth in Business Solutions and tight cost management across the company helped us deliver a strong increase in profitability. We also returned almost $190 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing the total to nearly $650 million returned in the first 9 months of the year. In the third quarter, our revenues increased 2%, or 5% in constant currency terms.", "Our consumer money transfer business drove the growth with revenue increasing 2% or 4% constant currency. Each of our geographic regions delivered constant currency growth in the quarter and U.S. outbound continued to be a strong point. Westernunion.com again provided good growth as money transfer revenues increased 21% on transaction growth of 34%, also led by strong growth from U.S. outbound.", "Adjusted return from traveling through Europe and Asia where I had great meetings regarding our global opportunities with business partners, customers and employees. We are all pleased with the current business performance and excited about the future. While there are certainly many concerns about the global economy and potential impact of geopolitical tensions, our results in Europe and in the Middle East remain positive in the quarter. As our previous pricing and other strategic actions in Europe and in Russia have helped drive good results.", "Strategically, we are continuing to develop our money transfer network and offer, in an innovative way, more choice and convenience to our customers. Money transfers via ATMs and other types of self-service terminals is one of our innovative methods of distribution. We have over 100,000 active ATMs and kiosks internationally, including large networks in Russia, Brazil and in Japan.", "Another example is the new service we recently implemented with Walgreens in the U.S. With this model, a consumer can initiate a transaction with Western Union through the self-service kiosk and then go to the counter for payment and receipt. This provides convenience for consumers, simplicity for the agent and opportunity for Western Union to add new distribution to our global network. We have already had good success with a similar service utilizing ATMs in Japan, and we plan to introduce additional offerings such as through mobile or online.", "In Business Solutions, after flat revenue in the second quarter, the business returned to growth with a 4% increase or 3% constant currency in the third quarter. FX volatility, foreign exchange volatility in the market remained low in the first couple of months of the quarter, but it increased in September, helping drive more customer activity. Business Solutions also continue to make progress getting more businesses to use its online applications which should aid loyalty and retention over time.", "Our overall company profitability in the quarter was strong with operating margins improving to 21.8%. Bringing [ph] some of the increases we have faced from compliance, retail agent commissions and certain other costs, we have been managing our discretionary expenses very tightly and plan to continue to drive operational efficiencies as we see opportunities.", "Although we are cautious about the state of the global economy, we are encouraged with our business trends and profitability improvements. Our third quarter profit results exceeded our expectations. We are adjusting our full year earnings per share outlook to approximately $1.50 at the high end of our previous range of $1.45 to $1.50. This includes some investments that we plan to make in the fourth quarter in areas such as cost initiatives, digital and mobile innovation, compliance and cybersecurity to help drive future growth and productivity. We are continuing to focus on strengthening consumer money transfer with emphasis on digital expansion, driving growth in Business Solutions and generating and deploying strong cash flow for our shareholders. And we believe the third quarter results demonstrated good progress in these areas.", "Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter, I will turn the call to Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Thank you, Hikmet. Total revenue in the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 2%, or 5% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. Electronic channels revenue increased 21% in the quarter and represented 6% of total company revenue.", "In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenue increased 2%, or 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. Western Union's C2C cross-border principal also increased 5% in the third quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis. Principal per transaction was flat compared to the prior year period both as reported and in constant currency. The spread between the C2C transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 3 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1%, while mix had minimal impact in the quarter overall. We believe the market has shown fairly stable pricing recently. We have made some price adjustments, both reductions and increases, in various quarters around the world, but we continue to expect our pricing actions for the remainder of the year to be modest.", "Turning to the regions. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 1% year-over-year including a negative 2% impact from currency, while transactions increased 10%. Revenue benefited from good performance in Germany and Turkey. The differential between transaction and revenue growth in the region was primarily driven by pricing and mix, including the impact of strong transaction growth from Russia which typically generates lower revenue per transaction than the European average.", "North America revenue grew 2% in the quarter while transactions increased 3%. U.S. outbound delivered strong growth again in the quarter and Mexico revenue increased 8% on transaction growth of 6%. Domestic money transfer revenue declined 2%, while transactions grew 4% in the quarter. Declines in higher principal bands caused the differential between transactions and revenue growth.", "In the Middle East/Africa region, revenue increased 3% with a negative 1% impact from currency, while transactions increased 1%. Strong revenue growth from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates drove the increase which was partially offset by declines in Libya due to political disruption.", "In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 1%, including a negative 1% impact from currency, while transactions are flat. Revenue benefited primarily from continued growth in Japan and the Philippines.", "Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 3% from the prior year period, including a negative 7% impact from currency, while transactions increased 2%. Reported revenue was impacted by continued government-imposed restrictions on the market in Venezuela and by the decline in the value of the Argentine peso compared to the prior year quarter.", "Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 21% in the quarter, while transactions increased 34%. U.S.-originated online transactions grew 32%. Several key corridors contributed strong increases to the online revenue growth, including the U.S. and the U.K. to India; the U.S. to the Philippines, Mexico and Jamaica; and European markets to several African countries.", "In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1% in the quarter but increased 11% on a constant currency basis. The differential between the reported and constant currency rates was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso. In South America, we continued to grow on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., electronic bill payments growth was partially offset by declines from cash walk-in. Business Solutions reported a revenue increase of 4%, or 3% constant currency, with good growth in North America and Europe and from our education-based services.", "Turning to consolidated margins. The third quarter GAAP operating margin was 21.8% compared to 21% in the prior year period. Operating margin benefited from cost savings initiatives and lower integration costs which were partially offset by higher compliance and legal expenses. Compliance expense in the quarter was approximately 3% of revenue. We now expect compliance-related expense to total approximately 3.5% of revenue for the full year.", "We achieved $14 million in incremental cost savings in the current quarter and we continue to expect approximately $45 million in incremental savings for the full year. The benefits from cost savings initiatives also reflect comparisons with cost in the third quarter of last year when we incurred $10 million of expenses related to the combination of cost savings initiatives and Travelex Global Business Payments integration.", "EBITDA margin was 26.4% in the quarter with an improvement from 25.8% a year ago. Our tax rate was 14.2% in the third quarter and we continue to expect a full year rate of around 15%. Reported earnings per share of $0.44 increased 13% from $0.39 in the third quarter of last year.", "The C2C segment operating margin was 24.9% compared to 24% in the prior year period. The margin improvement was primarily due to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher compliance expenses. Retail agent commission rates were also higher than the prior year period.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 15.4% in the third quarter compared to 19.2% in the prior year period. Similar to previous quarters this year, the C2B margin declined primarily due to higher funding costs related to increased interchange expense driven by increased credit card usage and higher principal per transaction in the U.S. electronic bill payments.", "Business Solutions operating income was at breakeven for the quarter which compared with a loss of $3 million for the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $14 million in the current quarter compared to $16 million in the prior year period. In addition to higher revenue and lower amortization expense, the reduction in operating loss was primarily due to lower integration costs and a value-added tax recovery which were partially offset by higher bank fees.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $775 million. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the third quarter and we now expect capital spending to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the full year.", "At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.7 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities.", "During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for a total of $122 million and we paid $66 million in dividends. Year-to-date through September, we have returned $645 million to shareholders. At quarter end, we had 524 million shares outstanding and $55 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires in June 2015.", "Finally, based on our third quarter results and forecast for the fourth quarter, we have updated our full year financial outlook. Our full year revenue outlook remains at low- to mid-single-digit constant currency growth, with GAAP revenue as flat to low single-digit growth due to some negative currency impact. This is consistent with the trends for the first 9 months of the year in which GAAP revenue increased 2% and revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis.", "Our operating profit margin outlook is now approximately 20%, which compares to the 19.5% to 20% range we've previously provided. Through the first 9 months, operating margins were 20.6%. Our full year outlook of approximately 20% assumes compliance cost increase in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year estimate to approximately 3.5% of revenue and also includes some investment spending to help drive our business in future years. This includes spend on additional cost savings initiatives as we continue to identify ways to operate our business more efficiently. As a result, we now expect earnings per share to be approximately $1.50 at the high end of our previous range of $1.45 to $1.50. The outlook for cash flow from operating activities remains at approximately $1 billion for the year.", "That concludes our review of the third quarter results. And operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Look, good execution on the cost side, on the margin side in particular. Just wanted to hit on that for a moment because the -- I guess, number one, it seems like you're taking the costs out as you promised, and what kind of extrapolation should we have for that going forward? Is this sustainable just given that we -- I guess we would have thought the margin extrapolation into the fourth quarter would lead to potentially a higher EPS guide than you did, as much as it was nice to see the raise. So just can you give us a little color on what really drove the margin improvement? Specifically what costs and how sustainable that is first?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure. Darrin this is Raj. As we came into the year, we knew that we had some cost pressures in various areas, the compliance costs, commission rates and we also wanted to invest money back in the business. And given that we've been managing our costs pretty tightly, and that's really what we saw here in the third quarter. As we've always said, we believe that as we get revenue growth, we'll get expansion on our profitability. So that's what we saw in the third quarter. As we go into the fourth quarter, we really have planned for some additional investments. First, we expect compliance cost to be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we've run at about 3%. For the year, we expect approximately 3.5%. It could be a little bit lower than that, but approximately 3.5%. And so that's one item. The other item is focused on cost savings initiatives. As we've done in past years, we believe there is more opportunity to optimize our cost structure and so we are putting those plans together. And to the extent that there's something material there, we'll talk to you more about it next year. And then lastly, we want to make some additional investments in certain areas of our business to drive future growth and productivity overall. So that's really why we've given the outlook that we have and we're comfortable with that at this stage.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess from a modeling standpoint, is that something we can really base our outlook on in terms of the level of cost, sort of the average of the third and fourth quarter would be a good way to look at it perhaps?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "We've given -- we believe that we'll be at about 20% for the year in terms of margin. So that's how you should model it.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, okay. All right, just a quick turning to the B2B business. It was definitely nice to see that show positive inflection. Just can you give us a little more color on what drove that? And again, just how sustainable that is?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure, sure. We're pleased with the return to growth there. We grew 4%, or 3% on a constant currency basis. In the quarter itself, if I could just give you a little bit of color, in the first 2 months of the quarter, we didn't see much volatility. But in the last month of the quarter, we did see some volatility return. And as we've said before, in the very short term, the business is impacted by volatility so that helped the results a little bit. Over the long term, we still believe that global trade growth will be a key driver of the business along with all the other things that the business is doing. We were pleased with the current results.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, also the payments -- Darrin, the payments part is coming pretty good. Remember we talked about that, about the university payments, student payments, these parts are all coming out so good. That helps.", "Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. Just last question -- that's great to hear. Just last question and I'll turn it back to the queue. On the capital allocation strategy, you guys have done a lot for shareholders this year. I think, like you said, over $600 million returned. When we think about the amount of generated cash internationally, can you just talk to us about the potential thoughts you and the board have around how you manage cash going forward? Is it still going to end up being the same strategy of looking for international deals with international cash? Or can we expect to see some changes towards more of a use for domestic purposes? And even if there's some tax changes that go with it, just any thoughts around that, and I appreciate it.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure. Darrin, our capital allocation policies haven't changed. We've been strong returners of capital for many years and that's, again, the case this year. We pay a very high dividend now. It's very much in line with market, but it's been increased a lot in the last few years and I would expect us to continue to focus on paying out a good dividend level. Stock buyback, we believe that we'll continue to have opportunities to do more stock buyback in the next few years as we unlock cash for domestic purposes. And to the extent that there are other opportunities to look at, it could be smaller acquisitions, it could be technology plays that give us some other capabilities. We'll look at that, but that's not our top priority right now. So our capital allocation policies, I would say, really haven't changed.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to ask just on the -- to clarify on the compliance then, I guess the implied guidance in the fourth quarter would be up to 5% of revenue on compliance. So I'm just curious, is that a number we should assume, if that's the case, for 2015 as well? Or is it just a onetime bump-up for year end? I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. Tien-tsin, I would say it's more of the latter. We've had some programs that are completing in the fourth quarter and that's the final push there. We also have been hiring people during the course of the year and we'll see more of a full impact from that in the fourth quarter. But as we have seen some efficiencies this year, we're hopeful that some of those will carry into next year as well. And we're just putting the detailed plans together, but we're happy with the overall results. We've been able to accomplish our key objectives in the compliance side and we've also done it more efficiently.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I wouldn't read too much on the Q4 on that, Tien-tsin, because remember we start to hire people in the beginning of the year and you'll see that's why it's a little bit higher in the Q4.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And I was just curious, maybe hopefully the 3.5%, 4% is sort of a better guide for 2015. Is that fair?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, I would just say that we're still doing some work to optimize that as much as we can. I wouldn't see it being higher than that range, but we are still working to get specific there.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understand that caveat. So just 2 more. Just on the pricing side, I'm glad to hear that it's been pretty stable or unsurprising. Is the competitive landscape changing and driving that? What sort of the, pricing being modest, what's driving that in your opinion?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Tien-tsin, as you know that has been stable for over last few quarters. We are pleased with our business performance. As you recall, 2 years ago we did some strategic action on 25% of our business and that's paying back. In our business, we are in 16,000 corridors, 200 countries. We do adapt our prices to the market environment and that has not changed. I think the competitive environment -- we are competing very well with our existing values, existing brand, existing networks. So I think I'm pleased with the environment currently.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, glad to hear. Glad to hear. Last one, I promise. Domestic business, how did that come in versus planned? I saw on the Q that looked like the high-band stuff had some impact I'm guessing maybe from Walmart? Can you elaborate on domestic?", "Hikmet Ersek", "No, I don't see any competitive disadvantage here. Our transactions are -- we are pleased with our plan. Our transaction grew about 4% in Q3. Especially in the lower bands, the transactions are going good, the Mobile Money Transfer is doing good. So 50,000 locations in the U.S. helps, right? People are sending money fast [ph] in good ways, so we are pleased with our domestic money transfer business currently.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "And Tien-tsin, as you'll recall, we -- our higher bands over the last several quarters have kind of been trending down and lower bands have been going up. So we haven't really seen a change in that pattern. We'll continue to monitor. Obviously, Walmart's doing a lot of advertising and we'll continue to monitor that. But so far, we really haven't seen an impact from it.", "Operator", "Next, we have a question from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "With the 21.8% operating margin, was that ahead of your guidance as planned? And if it was, what drove the surprise?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, it was better than we had expected. Again, we've been managing our costs quite tightly and we've been managing -- obviously, we're seeing compliance come in lower than we had expected for the first 9 months of the year. So that's helped a bit and that continued in the third quarter. But on our discretionary expenses, we've also been just managing those as efficiently as possible and just -- go ahead.", "Hikmet Ersek", "The team is executing, Bryan, really, the team is executing. We have a plan. The team is executing and the compliance cost came lower than we expected, and we are executing in an efficient way that helped a lot.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So fourth quarter, though, the margin will come out less than kind of most people expected. It feels like, though, maybe you're just pulling forward some expense just to get it into the fourth quarter but maybe doing some extra things in the quarter and on expense side that you might not have planned originally. Is that fair?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Not necessarily. There is some timing of expenses, but we're -- compliance is something that will step up in the fourth quarter. We have various cost initiatives that we want to try to achieve in the fourth quarter because we think there is more opportunity there. And we want to invest in the business to drive growth, whether it's digital-oriented innovation or other areas like cybersecurity and just overall productivity for the business, that's really where we want to put the money in. We're going to invest as smartly as we've always done and we believe there's opportunity there.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think also digital is still the big investment, I believe, on mobile, I believe on digital innovation and we're going to continue to invest. Also the cybersecurity is always on our focus area and compliance, obviously, and that some investment will be done in Q4.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But now fourth quarter will be materially different or lower than the other 3 quarters, but there shouldn't be any seasonally anything going on in the third quarter that causes that impact?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "No, not necessarily. I mean, we should see pretty stable revenue trends and it's really about these areas that we want to spend more money on and it's really a proactive move on our part to go after these specific areas.", "Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just finally for me, commission rates, can you talk about how they are looking compared to plan and kind of as we go forward into next year? Or do we have a handle on that or those continue to escalate?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "It's too early to say for next year. But the commission rates on the retail side are playing out as we had expected. We expected a little bit of a bump-up in those costs and that's what we're seeing. But they're pretty well under control, I would say. And as the mix of our business changes, we'll be able to bring down overall distribution costs, but I would say that they're not getting away from us, if I can say it that way. They're pretty well under control.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It looks like transaction and revenue growth in digital decelerated quite a bit sequentially in 3Q. Can you talk about what led to the slowdown in transactions? And also what kind of initiatives you guys have in place to sort of try to reaccelerate that growth rates over the next couple of quarters?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, Smitti, you're talking about westernunion.com digital business?", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, yes, yes, westernunion.com.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. Well, Smitti, I think we are pleased with our westernunion.com and our digital business. If you look at that 34% transaction growth, quite impressive, and 21% revenue growth, I think we are continuing to expand. We are in 20 -- over 20 countries with our Dot.com. But also our existing business where we have been longer in U.S. outbound is working very well. And that had a 34% or something like that...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "32% U.S. outbound, yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "32% transaction growth from the U.S. outbound. So I am pleased with current environment. And next is that can we expand this westernunion.com digital business to more corridors? Expect taking that to Asia or to other countries is our long-term initiative year.", "Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then maybe just to follow up on a different issue. I think you guys have been testing instant ACH over the past couple of months. Just wondering if there's been any -- if there's any update in terms of when you potentially will plan to roll out that product more broadly?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Raj, do you want to take that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, yes. Smitti, I would just start out by saying that we are going to introduce it more formally in the fourth quarter, but we operate a global business. It's not just from the U.S. We operated segments [ph] in more than 20 markets. We -- we send money, or a lot of customers send money, globally around the world into 200 countries and territories, and now also into 50 markets into a bank account. And we have various bank-like funding capabilities throughout Europe and obviously in the U.S. So today have ACH on a delayed basis and we have been heavily testing instant ACH with several thousand customers. We also have done tens of thousands of transactions there, and we think that'll be another feature that will help the growth in our business but we're doing many other things that are driving the growth in our business. And as we get into the early part of next year, we'll also be more proactive in advertising that to consumers at the front end of the transaction, but we think it will be an additional feature of the many things we're doing to improve the overall customer experience.", "Operator", "The next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On the compliance front, I'm wondering if you've seen any noticeable differences to how certain governments are approaching compliance requirements?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, it's a hot subject. It has been very dynamic in the last 3 years, right, 2 to 3 years. And operating in 200 countries, every government has their own environment and we -- that's one of -- that's why we are investing about 3.5% of our revenue in the compliance. And I would say that it's a dynamic environment. I wouldn't say that it changed the last 6 months than it was earlier before 6 months, but it's a dynamic environment and we are upgrading our compliance part there and investing actually. I see that as investment because I really believe long term it's a competitive advantage. It puts us in a place we have the regulatory license in 200 countries, we can operate and we do compliance in 200 countries, we do the settlement and we pay out in 121 countries -- currencies, puts us really in a way that we can be very active in the cross-border and cross-currency money transfer.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then following about the online discussion. How are you thinking about pricing going forward for online? Do you see that as continuing to change much? Are you comfortable with the current structure?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I'm quite comfortable in the current structure and the environment where we operate. We do operate in 20 countries and -- to 200 countries so that gives us many, many corridors. We adapt our prices corridor by corridor, as you know, Sara, and band by band. I'm quite comfortable with our current pricing structure. And still 80% of our customers are new to our network. They like our network, they like that we can tell to customers that you can send money from Canada immediately and payout in Vietnam immediately or pay out in Uganda or payout in Morocco. That's what we do and we are satisfied with our current products and pricing.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then just last question on Europe. Volumes continue to improve in spite of pretty difficult comparisons. Could you give us some more detail about what you're seeing in the region?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Go ahead, Raj. I'm listening.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Sara, the -- in Europe, we saw good contributions from various parts of Europe. Germany and Turkey, in particular, helped the growth there. We also saw a very good transaction growth in Russia. And so that drove some of the higher transaction growth that we're seeing there. So overall, pretty stable trends. We have some negative FX impact that drove the revenue down a little bit further. But overall, pretty good results.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Our customers are quite resilient despite some uncertainty in the global economy. Sometimes they use lower RPTs, but -- lower principal amount. But I would say that we are very pleased with our performance in Europe.", "Operator", "The next question -- sorry the next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to pick up on the comment you made earlier that I think Q4, you're going to make some investments around some new cost savings initiatives. So how should we think about the incremental OpEx savings that we should be considering on top of the $45 million you're expecting this year? So in the context of 2015, how much incremental could we see?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, Jason, there are 3 things that are happening in the fourth quarter. First, compliance costs are increasing, so that's just part of our plan to put the right processes in place. And then we are also spending money to drive further growth in the business in some key areas as we mentioned. And then the last area, which is an area that we're still putting all the details together on, are our cost savings initiatives to drive further growth. And I would just say, right now we're at an early stage of that planning process. But to the extent that, that's a material number, then we'll give you more color around that next year when we give our outlook.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So I mean, I guess, if you're taking out some amount of costs next year and if revenue growth continues to trend positively next year, is there any reason conceptually that margins shouldn't be up year-over-year in 2015 versus 2014?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Jason, to be fair, we don't give '15 guidance, as you know. But I could say that our business model is based on revenue growth. If revenue growth -- our variable costs are higher than our fixed costs, 65% to 35% ratio, right, so it should help, of course, long term on the margins. But I would say that we are very much focused also in Q4 to have productivity actions, optimize our business, but there are some investments also required. As I said earlier, I'm excited about digital, I'm excited about mobile, I'm excited about compliance investments and that gives us a competitive -- long-term competitive advantage and that helps us. So we're going to continue to invest there. And so long term, when revenue picks up, that should help, obviously. Our goal was always grow -- profitable growth.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Right. And just last question, can you give us a sense of where you think -- in absolute dollars, where total digital channel revenue will come in for 2014?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. I mean, in terms of total dollars, it should be in the mid-200, mid-200 range.", "Operator", "Next we have a question from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess my first question is, as I look at the C2C transaction rate, it's down now to the mid-single-digit level as comps get tougher. I'm thinking, is that the only reason that the C2C transaction is down to the mid-single digits because -- or is there any other reason that I might be missing?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Maybe you can jump in; let me start. Let me try to start Ashwin's question. If you recall, we did pricing actions. They're coming to anniversary, and we were planning that we have a lower transaction growth because pricing actions, they have -- and it's -- I think we completed all of them last quarter, right? And now we're planning with a lower -- that's a big part of that. So I would not -- and I don't see the competition market share loss. I think we are pretty much growing with the market. Our principles are -- we are gaining, in many corridors, market share and we are doing -- overall, we are growing with the market.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "No, I meant your own comps not competition. I meant your comps are getting tougher. Just year-over-year comps, that's what I meant. So what I was going for was, is a mid-single-digit transaction growth stay -- sustainable going forward on the C2C side?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "We don't give a transaction growth forecast, Ashwin, but just -- if you just take a look at the market growth that's happening, market growth this year, in principle at least, is expected to be around 6%, and our principal growth has been around 7% and we've grown our transactions year-to-date by about 6%. So we'll get a slightly higher transaction growth this year than we did last year, and so I think we're growing in-line with market. And really, now going forward, it's all about how we execute on the various strategies that we have rather than the prices which are almost a couple of years old now.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, okay. Understood. And on the cost side, a few questions have been asked about your compliance costs going up in Q4. I guess I just want to step back and ask you, what is it that drives quarter-to-quarter variability fluctuations in this kind of what should really be a long-term compliance spending type of a trajectory?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Good question, Ashwin. I think, as you recall, Ashwin, we did the big investments this year and it took some time to hire the people. And we do unfortu -- we do have to invest there and we have to hire these people. And these are great people where they really call -- have callbacks and they do avoid bad transactions. So that give us some costs into Q4. But going forward, we should have seen -- we should see some stability here. And so you could run your models and we also are planning that stability. But it's evolving environment. If you operate in 200 countries, you have some costs.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes. And Ashwin, we've ramped up with some of the people hiring during the year, of course, as Hikmet said, but there's also some variability in terms of outside contractors and services and technology investments. So there are some variations in quarters depending on what projects we're doing, and we just expect an increase in some of that in Q4.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Understood. And if I could squeeze one more in. When I look at wu.com and the pricing on that, there seems to be -- maybe, correct me if I'm wrong, but is there a greater dependence perhaps on FX than on transaction fees when I look at wu.com transactions?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Not necessarily. I mean, we do promotional pricing there and it's -- it can be geared towards the fee side of the equation. But it's really both fee and FX are going to drive that business longer term. For us it's not about the initial transaction that a consumer might do. It's really about the lifetime value of that transaction once they do some business with us.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Also [indiscernible] it depends in which corridor you operate, right? We have a different pricing from Germany, then we have different pricing from the U.S.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, right. Just kind of personally more focused on 2 corridors. So that's based on personal experience, I was just asking you.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "I wonder if we could get a sense, it sounds like the pricing continues to improve. Is part of that just some competition coming out of the sector given the step-up in compliance, or is it just the overall environment? Just any thoughts on pricing.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally, I would say we had a very competitive environment. Maybe sometimes you have to write [ph] us green [ph] in the U.S. but we do have also competitors globally in every corridor and we do compete quickly good on that environment. I would say the competition has not disappeared. There are some challenges for smaller competition to comply with the regulatory environment. And we did not see the big changes on our revenue, on our transaction yet, but you know that some of the smaller competitors are having more trouble and to compete in the market because they can't comply with the anti-money laundering requirements.", "Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research", "Got it. And then just -- and I apologize for another question on the compliance, but across that 3%, do we have a sense of how much of that is recurring versus onetime as we think about '15? And as we think about the model, should it be steady-state 3% of revenue or an absolute dollar amount that'll just get -- you'll get leverage with over the course of time?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Kevin, I would just say that there are activities that we are completing this year and they'll fall off the radar screen, but there are other activities that are -- that we have planned for that are going to be added back to the equation for next year. So even though we may have some things that are potentially considered onetime in nature, we're going to have additional activities and things to do next year. This is a global compliance effort, so if we have finished a set of countries this year, we have another set of countries coming at us next year. So it really is -- we really look at it as a percent of revenue cost as we go forward.", "Michael A. Salop", "Yes. And Kevin, roughly half of our compliance cost relates to compensation, so that would kind of be steady-state. The others can fluctuate.", "Operator", "All right then. The final question will come from George Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just had a question looking at the COGS line, you performed very well there this quarter. It came in below sort of the 59% that we've been at for the last several quarters. Did anything change with respect to mix on commissions? Or was there anything that lowered commission as a percentage of overall revenue in the quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Not specifically, George. [indiscernible]", "Hikmet Ersek", "Not specifically. I think, as you know, commissions are we do agreements -- long-term agreements with agents, right? It's -- and it changes quarter-by-quarter or year-by-year better, but not specifically, George. I think we've been quite consistent the last 3 quarters, I guess. Raj?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "Yes, we've had higher bank fees and some higher retail commission rates, but we had benefits from various cost savings initiatives and lower integration spend so that's -- some of that is showing up.", "Hikmet Ersek", "But that was offset also by higher interchange fees at our C2B business. As you know, in the -- our bill payments business in the U.S. had a higher interchange fee. So it will look better, but that interchange fees increase also offset that part.", "Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just last question. As we think about the agreements you have now with some of your agents, the self-serve kiosks and the like, do those materially change your commission rates there? Meaning, is that a strong lever down the road for lowering commission expense for Western Union?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, strategically, long term, I would say, yes, because as we diversify our portfolio, channel portfolio, like retail -- not only from retail to retail also retail to an account, account to account, mobile -- wallets to mobile, if you go [ph], and this is growing very fast, our multichannel alternative channels, they have technically lower commission rates. And it's all about -- it's too small that you can't see it currently impact our P&L. But long term, it should help our commission rates and our diversification of our channels.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal", "And it's a great model for distribution because it really sort of matches the retail with the new way of distributing the product. Particularly as the customer can walk in the store and sort of complete the transaction on their own, and then they walk up to the person at the counter and it's a quick transaction process. So it's more efficient in nature.", "Michael A. Salop", "Thanks everyone for joining our call today. Hope you have a good afternoon. Thanks.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded.

Overall I am pleased with our 2014 results especially with profitability earnings and earnings per share which exceed our expectations. In consumer money transfer revenues increased 3% in constant currency term as the actions we implemented in late 2012 and early 2013 helped return this business to positive revenue growth. Online again led the way with westernunion.com consumer money transfer revenues increasing 28% for the year. Western Union Business Solutions revenue increased 4% in constant currency in 2014.", "The business experienced good improvement in the fourth quarter after being negatively impacted in the middle of the year by a lack of foreign exchange volatility and the consumer bill payment business produced strong constant currency growth with U.S. electronic bill pay again posting solid results. While we continue to make investments in our compliance capabilities across the businesses, we were able to deliver operating profit, operating margin improvement in 2014. Efficiency initiative helped us increase the profit margin and earnings per share for the year increased 11% to $1.59.", "Our business also continued to generate great cash flow with approximately a $1 billion from operating activities in 2014 and we remain committed to return significant free cash flow to shareholders. Over the course of the year, we returned over $750 million through this combination of dividends and share repurchases. We are very pleased to announce enhancements to our capital return program these include a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend which raises it\u2019s from $0.50 to $0.62 on an annualized basis and a three year $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization. Our intent is to periodically raise the dividend while continuing to have a balanced return comprised of both meaningful dividend and buyback.", "As we begin 2015, we are continued to execute to strengthen consumer money transfer with an emphasis on online and mobile and extent reach on penetration in businesses solutions while retaining our focus on generating and deploying strong cash flow. We believe our cross-border money transfer business is well positioned and we do not anticipate a need for a significant cross-border pricing action in 2015.", "However we are facing some global economic headwind, including the impact of a stronger U.S dollar and slowing economic in key send markets such as Europe and Russia and some competitive pressure in our U.S retail domestic money transfer business. Overall we expect to grow revenues on a constant currency basis in 2015 but reported growth is anticipated to be negatively impacted by currency translation which we estimate will affect revenues by approximately $300 million compared to 2014 rates. In spite this we anticipate our cost saving initiative and foreign exchange hedges will help mitigate the impact on profitability.", "We expect 2015 operating margin to increase to approximately 21% and earnings per share to be in a range of approximately $1.58 to $1.65. Strategies will be remaining focus on being a leader in cross-border, cross currency money transfer for consumer and businesses. We want to build on our cost border money transferring gene which includes our pay in and pay out network, our foreign exchange and settlement systems and our data management and compliance capabilities. To serve new used cases and bring in more customers with expanded connection point. We want to allow customers to transact almost anywhere anytime to the channel they prefer. For West Union that means more mobile and account connection, more online options and more ATM and self-service Kiosk. In addition to further enhancement to our retail network West Union business solutions remains a very important part of our strategies providing account based service to diverse type of customers. We continue to believe we can drive strong growth in B to B as we shift our portfolio to more integrated customer solution and we expect profitability in this business to accelerate as revenue increases. ", "We are proud that West Union plays an important role in providing financial services to under serve customers and businesses aiding economic growth in many parts of the road and allowing families to improve their life and small businesses to grow. In 2014 we delivered on our earnings call and I will like to thank my management team and all of our employees and agents around the world to their dedication and hard work. In 2015 we continue to focus on execution and although we are facing some revenue challenges from currencies we expect to generate good profitability and cash flow. Now to give you a more detailed review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and our 2015 outlook, I will turn the call over to Raj.", "Raj Agrawal", "Thank you Hikmet. As I review 2014 financial results I will focused primarily on the fourth quarter. Similar information for the full year can be found in press release and the attached financial schedules. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $1.4 billion was down 1% compared to the prior year period while on a constant currency basis revenue increased 4%. Depreciation in the Argentine peso to Euro and other currencies around the world drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenue. In the consumer segment revenue decrease 2% on a reported basis or increase 2% on a constant currency basis. Transactions also increased 2% in the quarter. Western Union C2C cross border principle decline 1% but increased 2% constant currency. Principle per transaction was down 4% compared to the prior year period and was flat in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and revenue decline in the quarter was four percentage points including a negative 4% impact in currency. There is minimal impact from pricing and mix in the fourth quarter for the full year the spread between C2C transaction and revenue growth was also 4 percentage point comprise of a negative 2% impact in currency and 1% each from pricing and mix. Turning to the region in the Europe and CIS region revenue decline 5% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Including a negative 6% impact from currency. Germany continued to deliver good growth but this was partially offset by weakness in other parts of Europe compared to the third quarter growth in Russia also slowed as the economy began to soften. Transactions in the Europe and CIS regions increased 6% North America revenue was flat in the quarter including a negative 1% impact from currency. Transactions increased 2% U.S outbound delivered big growth again in the quarter and Mexico revenue increase to 11% on transaction growth of 9%. ", "Our growth in Mexico was higher than the reported market growth from New Mexico from both the fourth quarter and the full year. Domestic money transfer revenue decline 4% while transactions grew 1% with a revenue decline being driven by reductions in the higher principle band. In the fourth quarter we began to see an impact on U.S retail domestic money transfer for recent competitive price changes and we have factor these trends into our 2015 outlook. We are implementing some price reduction in the higher principle band and parts of the country where we are seeing the most competitive impact and we will monitor these results.", "Strategically we are also focused on further marketing and expanding our online domestic business which is still growing nicely. Our network and brand give us a strong position with online and mobile transfer cash pick up which is generally a different used case than the many account to account offerings in the domestic market. As a reminder domestic money transfer represents about 8% of our total revenues and this includes the westernunion.com domestic business. ", "In the Middle East and Africa region revenue decline 3% with a negative 3% impact from currency while transactions decreased 3%. Good revenue growth from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates was offset by softness in Africa especially Libya where business remains limited due to the unstable geopolitical conditions. In Asia Pacific revenue was down 3% including a negative 4% impact from currency while transactions decline 4%. Revenue continued to benefit from strong growth in Japan which was partially offset by slowing in the Philippines. ", "Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 3% from the prior year period including a negative 7% impact from currency while transactions increased 2%. Revenue was impacted by continued government posed restrictions on market in Venezuela and by the decline in the value of Argentine peso compared to the prior year quarter. ", "Westernunion.com C2C revenue grew 19% in the quarter including a negative 4% impact from currency while transactions increased 27%. U.S. originated online transactions grew 29%. Electronic channels revenue increased 17% in the quarter and represented 6% of total company revenue. In the consumer-to-business segment revenue grew 4% in the quarter or increased 15% on a constant currency basis. The differential between the reported and constant currency rates continued to be primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentina peso compared to the prior year period. Consistent with prior quarters in the U.S. strong growth from electronic bill payments was partially offset by declines from cash walk-in while the South America business increasing on a constant currency basis. ", "Business solutions reported revenue increased to 1% or 5% constant currency with good growth in hedging products and from our education and financial institution services. ", "Turning to consolidated margins the operating profit margin was 19.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 16.8% in the prior year period. Operating margin improvement was primarily driven by cost savings initiatives and lower integration expenses. Overall in 2014 we achieved $47 million in incremental savings from our cost initiatives including $15 million of savings in the fourth quarter. ", "We incurred approximately $30 million of expenses in the quarter to derive future efficiencies. These expenses relate primarily to severance cost and compared to approximately $33 million of similar cost incurred in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect the new initiatives to generate approximately $15 million to $20 million of savings in 2015. Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter and approximately 3.3% of revenue for the full year. The EBITDA margin was 24.5% in the quarter compared to 21.3% in the prior year period. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 6.1% benefited some non-recurring items and our full year effective tax rate was 12%. Reported earnings per share of $0.42 increased 35% from $0.31 in the prior year period driven by cost savings initiatives, the lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding.", "The C2C segment operating margin was 23.1% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period with the improvement primarily driven by cost savings initiatives. The consumer-to-business operating margin was 14.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 15.6% in the prior year period. The C2B margin declined primarily due to higher interchange expense driven by the increased credit card usage and higher principal per transaction the U.S. electronic bill payments. Business solutions reported an operating loss of $5 million per quarter which compared with a loss of $11 million for the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $13 million and both the 2014 fourth quarter and the prior year period. The reduction in operating loss for business in the quarter was primarily due to lower integration costs. ", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was approximately $1 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures were $50 million in the fourth quarter, for the full year capital spending was approximately 3% of revenue as agent signing bounces decline from prior year levels. At the end of the year the company had debt of $3.7 billion and cash of $1.8 billion approximately half of the cash was held by United States entities.", "During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for total of $43 million. We also paid $65 million in dividends in the quarter. At year-end we have 521 million shares outstanding and $12 million remained under our previous $500 million authorization. ", "For the full year we returned $753 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. As Hikmet mentioned we also announced today a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend and a new repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion which expires in December of 2017.", "Turning to our outlook for 2015, our expectations reflect continued progress and key strategies as well as anticipated impacts from the stronger U.S. dollar and the softening of European and certain other economies.", "We expected growth from U.S. outbound but we have also factored in decline in our U.S. retail domestic money transfer business as we deal with the competitive pricing pressure in the market. While we plan to implement some price reductions in U.S. domestic money transfer, we do not expect significant price changes in our cross-border business which represents approximately 90% of the total C2C revenues. As a result of these factors, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the low single digit on a constant currency basis, GAAP revenues expected to be decreased in the low to mid-single digits reflecting the expected negative currency impact from the depreciation of the euro and other major currencies.", "Our outlook assumes euro and other major developed markets currency remain around current rate throughout 2015. As Hikmet mentioned, we are estimating changes and exchange rates relative to 2014, will negatively impact 2015 revenue by approximately $300 million. This amount is net of the expected benefit from foreign exchange hedges implemented to partially offset major currency movements. Based on current rates we anticipate the hedge benefit to be approximately $70 million. Operating margins are expected to benefit from cost saving initiatives and the foreign exchange hedges.", "The hedge impact on our margin percentages move inversely with foreign currency movements when the euro weakens, it negatively impacts our revenue translation but the impact on profitably is less due to the hedges. Consequently as we go to 2015, our margin percentage could be influenced by further significant exchange rate movements but the likely the impact on profitability is minimal. Since compliance expenses came in lower than expected at 3.3% of revenues in 2014, there is a year-over-year increase plan for 2015 but this year\u2019s spending projections still within our original 3.5% to 4% expectations laid out last year.", "The increase in 2015 is primarily due to additional hiring and the full year expense related to headcount added throughout 2014. We expect our operating profit margins in 2015 to be approximately 21% which compares to 20.3% in 2014, and we expect a tax rate of approximately 13% which is an increase from last year\u2019s 12% rate. As a result, we currently expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.65. The outlook for cash from operating activity is approximately $1 billion for the year. This outlook excludes $100 million of anticipated final tax payments relating to the agreement announced with the IRS in December of 2011.", "Some or all of these tax payments may be paid in 2015 but timing is difficult to predict as it is affected by completion of other ongoing to federal tax matters. So overall we\u2019re pleased with the 2014 results especially in regards to profitability and we remain focused on strong capital allocation for our shareholders. Although we faced some revenue headwinds as we added 2014 we have taken steps to benefit profitability and we continue to execute our strategies and investment for the future.", "Operator we are now ready to open lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. ", "Bryan Keane", "Just a couple of questions, if I heard you correctly I think you said the cash of 1.8 billion approximately maybe half of that was held in the United States, if I remember correctly you said it was only about third of so held in the United States, so did you guys figure out a way to bring back some back to the U.S.?", "Raj Agrawal", "Hi, Bryan, this is Raj. No, it\u2019s just really timing more than anything, typically we have a large portion of cash that\u2019s in bank account, and it\u2019s in transit. So it\u2019s really money that not accessible to us. We have another portion that\u2019s held for regulatory purposes and then we have some cash that maybe excess in nature, some of it is going to be held by our international operations and some of it will be with domestic, but the fact that there is more domestically is really just timing in nature and it\u2019s not necessarily related to anything else.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay and then just understand the hedging techniques, the 70 million, will that -- that show up that\u2019s in the operating line and just to clarify that? And then secondly what would the operating margins be doing if we didn\u2019t have the hedges? Would they be above flat or just give us some color there? Thanks.", "Raj Agrawal", "Sure Bryan. The $70 million benefit that we have will be helping both the revenue lines so the revenues will not be -- will be better by $70 million versus what they would have been and then that also helps our profit lines by the same amounts. So that gives us a point of benefit on the operating profit margin lines and had the hedges not been in place the margins would have been about the same level of last years, so about 20%. We have cost savings initiatives that are helping us this year and that would help to offset any translation impact as well as some of the other increase investments that we\u2019re making. So margins would have been above the same as last year ex the hedges.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay great, that\u2019s what I thought. Just last question for me any color on the three segments on what to think about for constant currency as we look to set our models for next year -- for this year actually?", "Raj Agrawal", "We don\u2019t give our specific outlook for each segment. But business positions were still very optimistic about the business we believe that business can grow in the low double digit range in the next few years. Last year in the second half of the year we saw the business accelerated from the low level of growth in the second quarter and it's on the right track as we continue to expand in some of the integrated payments here because our payments part of that business beyond the basic [FX] services has been growing really well in university segment and the SI segment as well as NGOs. And in terms of the payments business we are continuing to get good growth there. The trends really haven\u2019t changed in that business. So did electronic growth that\u2019s been offset by declines in our cash lock and business here in the U.S and then in South America on a constant currency basis it's doing just fine but we have the Argentine peso issue there. And I think I gave a fair amount of our color on the C2C business.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Maybe you mentioned digital is going good.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes of course the digital business we're very excited about that\u2019s got some great growth opportunities to it. We\u2019re expanding our channel capability their on an ongoing basis. We already deliver money in cash anywhere in the world but we're also expanding our bank funding and pay out capabilities which will be the growth drivers for this area of the business on a long term basis. ", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Good working on the margins. Just wanted to ask on the compliance spend such better than we saw you're exiting I think 3.6%, Raj? So is there a clear line of sight for more spending going into 2015 I guess is a question on visibility there? Thanks. ", "Raj Agrawal", "We expect the spending and compliance to be about 3.5% to 4% in 2015 and that\u2019s largely related to the cost of all the people that we hired in 2014. So we're going just see the fuller impact of that this year. ", "Hikmet Ersek", "And also the international expansions of compliance program know your customer and know your agent expansion. But these are low effect of being 3.5% to 4% attention. ", "Tien-tsin Huang", "My second question my follow up is just on the domestic money transfer. So sounds like you're just selective price actions in certain markets in response to MoneyGram and in Walmart. What it takes to revise your pricing more broadly. What are you looking for to go towards more of a uniform price change versus selective price changes? Thanks. ", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well it's basically our business that impact in the higher principle amount right, I mean we see good growth in the lower principle amount continue especially to online and mobile part is going very good on the domestic money transfer business. On the higher principle amount we did see some impact on our business. So we do look at where are the impacts happening in which areas with a higher principle amount and we will adopt our prices there. The bit of our business although we have 500,000 locations we exactly know where the consumers behavior is in which location, how to behave and we do implement specific pricing actions. Now we will look at it how the market react, but overall I don\u2019t anticipate in 2015 big price changes I think this invest we will do on domestic money transfer. But overall I would say that we will -- I don\u2019t anticipate big pricing investments.", "Operator", "Next we have a question from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller", "I just wanted to follow up quickly on the margin side. I mean to be clear you're saying there is a $70 million from hedging is actually what gave you a benefit of about percent on the margin. So there would have been about 20% I think you said before. I guess when we look into that a little bit I guess that compares to about 20.2 or just over 20% in '14 like you said. With revenue on a constant currency basis growing I guess you're saying your backing out the currency hedging. What exactly is the pressure is from? Is it just the increase in regulatory cost on a year over year basis by small market or is it something on the mix front that\u2019s not -- that\u2019s for many for having a little more margin expansion?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes during it is Raj. Margins we see it being at approximately same levels so 20% last year and 20% this year. We have cost saving initiative that are helping us going into this year. But when you take the hedges out you do have the negative impact on the overall profit line from removal of the hedges. So that\u2019s hurting us and so the cost savings initiatives are helping to offset some of the translation impact and then we also are investing slightly more in compliances as you heard and then we just have higher inflationary cost in the business and in our fixed cost structure that are just a part of doing business. So those are some of the components that get us to about the same margins this year. ", "Hikmet Ersek", "I want to add a little bit that currency outside of the hedges currency is negatively impacting -- if we do have fixed cost in the U.S.", "Darrin Peller", "Just quick follow up on the forward looking. When you think about the mix in terms of transaction growth versus revenue growth again this quarter I think you said a couple of -- early outlook had a couple points of spread differential. Can you again just explain the moving parts? You said you had a better point I think from pricing, a point or a couple of points from mix or -- can you just describe a little more detail what the mix was and how we should think about that going forward?", "Raj Agrawal", "Sure. In the fourth quarter we had 2% transaction built there was no impacts from pricing and no impacts from mix and there was a four parentage point impact from currency which got us to the negative 2% reported growth in C2C and those are the three components that you go forward, again the pricing environment is little bit more stable, DMT may do some more but otherwise it\u2019s going to be historical norms, low single-digits. From the mix impact, we haven\u2019t seen the mix impact over the last couple of quarters as we\u2019ve anniversaries of some of the bigger mix changes and then currency is the wild card, it\u2019s hard to predict where currency will and that\u2019s really the last component.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay. So putting currency aside is it fair to assume maybe just one or two point of spread between transaction growth and actual revenue growth for this year and maybe even longer term?", "Raj Agrawal", "I\u2019m not going to give a prediction on exactly where that\u2019s going to be, but again the pricing is relatively stable, I see us doing some pricing around the world and little bit in DMT so you\u2019ll have to make your assumptions around that.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay, all right. I appreciated guys. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. ", "Smitti Srethapramote ", "Thank you. The effective tax rate of 13% in 2015 is bit lower than what the -- I think your original guidance of 15% for 2014 was before the one-time items that you guys experienced in Q4, can you talk about the drivers that allow you guys to lower the rate in 2015 below what was below the 2014 numbers? ", "Raj Agrawal", "We\u2019ve always thought Smitti, that we can be in the mid-teens area for the tax rate and that\u2019s really within our overall range that we look at, it\u2019s really just the function of all the different entities that we\u2019re operating around the world. We have the global business we operate in very low tax jurisdictions and so that allows us to keep our tax rate relatively low. So it\u2019s nothing more than that, it\u2019s just ongoing tax planning that we have.", "Smitti Srethapramote ", "Got it. And you mentioned that you guys have that couple of causing initiatives that\u2019s going to help support margins in 2015; can you talk about some of the new areas of cost saves that you guys are targeting for 2015 that wasn\u2019t implemented in 2014?", "Raj Agrawal", "We took $30 million of additional cost in the fourth quarter of last year and that\u2019s going to translate into about $15 million to $20 million of incremental savings. In addition, we achieved $47 million of savings last year, but on the run rate basis that\u2019s going to about 60 this year, so it\u2019s an incremental $10 million to $15 million and that\u2019s really related to just eliminating roles throughout the organization and pushing rolls into lower cost jurisdictions around the world, so just shifting our organization to be aligned with our overall business.", "Smitti Srethapramote ", "Got it. And just lastly the mid-teens tax rate do you think that is sustainable for the next couple of years?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes, approximately mid-teens that\u2019s about where we target and we think that\u2019s achievable for the next few years. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Gubins ", "Thanks. Could you talk about any impact you might be seeing around the world from lower oil prices, are you starting to see that impact from for [indiscernible]?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Let me take that Sara. We do see a different dynamics in different parts of the world that the beauty of our business being in 200 countries I mean our U.S. out bound, you heard from Raj, U.S. outbound business is doing pretty well, the strong dollar helps size also the U.S. economy helps size.", "On the other side Russia it had kept some impact in our business, we saw some slowness in Russia to central Asia especially in these countries in Ukraine and so. But that all depended on the foreign exchange and oil price the economic environment. We do see -- we don\u2019t see in the Middle East that big impact I think the project that would in place there still continuing happening the people our customers here still sending money to their loved ones, especially to South Asia and we don\u2019t see the big impact. But long-term I don\u2019t what the oil price will happen. But it\u2019s too short I mean it\u2019s only three months that volatility and the oil price happened. The other side of coin is that being in 200 countries helps, you do see some slowness in some parts of the Europe but on the other side Germany is doing pretty well and the out bound is doing well.", "So I would say overall I\u2019m cautious about 2015 and uncertain on 2015 about the global economy, but being in 200 countries helps us, our customers to continue to do transaction.", "Sara Gubins ", "Would it be possible to try to help size what percent of your transactions are coming from countries where oil production is really critical component?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think, as you know the big part of our business in the Middle East Gulf state out bound business but we don\u2019t disclose that information actually and I don\u2019t think that -- all this oil price changes, all this current oil price environment has been projected in our 2015 outlook.", "Sara Gubins ", "Okay, great. And then just switching gears basically wu.com logins continue to do really strong but they are decelerating, could you talk to us about your revenue expectations for digital in 2015?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we still believe that our 2015 revenue will be strong. We still believe that digital specially also on mobile we believe it\u2019s going to grow very fast. We are now more than in 20 countries I believe almost in 24 countries with our online digital sending money to 200 countries and our goal is expanding the geographical expansion, but also we have very strong growth in the U.S. Our last quarter U.S. growth was 29%. So I think that there is still huge opportunity in Europe in outbound. We are just on the beginning of expanding our online businesses in Europe and we do have some business Australia and New Zealand but I will like have that -- we\u2019re today in our retail business in 200 countries. Why not being also with our online business in 200 counties and that\u2019s our expansion policy we\u2019re going to put a lot of emphasis behind that.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. ", "Jim Schneider", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the types of cost control actions you put in place that you referred to earlier the incremental $15 million to $20 million in savings, specifically where some of those actions or where some of those areas were and then maybe if you look into 2015, can you maybe talk about any incremental opportunity we have to reduce cost as we head throughout the year that maybe not included in that guidance?", "Raj Agrawal", "Sure Jim, this is Raj. As I mentioned earlier, we have taken out some positions and some of the higher cost jurisdictions and put them into lower cost centers that we have around the world and they are -- some of them are executive type positions and some of them are shared services type positions, but these are really optimization actions that we have been taking on an annual basis and I would expect that we will continue to look at optimization efforts for both our fixed and variable cost structures. It\u2019s not a onetime expenses for us it something that we look at an ongoing basis and we\u2019ll continue to prune way out some of the costs that we have. So I do believe there are additional opportunities and we\u2019ll keep looking for those.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Also one thing I\u2019d like to mention here is that we built the transformation of this we have a special leader on looking at our processes. By optimizing our processes we do find some cost savings activated. We really do the business in different way which we did in many years ago that brings also our constant cost saving dollar actually.", "Jim Schneider", "That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks. And I guess relative just picking on one geography, the APAC region for a second, I may have missed it but can you maybe go through some of the factors that drove the year-over-year decline in transactions as well as revenue in APAC?", "Raj Agrawal", "In APAC, the business declined by 3% or grew 1% on a constant currency basis and transactions were down 4%. What we saw on that region is that Japan continued to be post good growth for us, but we saw slowdown in Philippine. We are also seeing an increase impact from compliance in APAC region and some of it is also grow but we had higher growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 on transaction, so some of its grow over. So those are some of the pieces that we\u2019re seeing in APAC region.", "Hikmet Ersek", "One of the things I would like also mention, we do expand our compliance activities globally and that has sometime impacted our revenue as we\u2019re as industry leader we want that compliance activities are implemented globally, but in short term it has an impact on our revenue when we expand that geographically but long term I believe it\u2019s a competitive advantage because we will -- I will the industry will follow that.", "Operator", "And the next comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Question on the 2015 EPS guidance, does that assume more or less ratable execution of the new share buyback plans to call 400 million or so for this year?", "Raj Agrawal", "I think that\u2019s say starting point Jason, obviously, the amount of repurchase that we\u2019ll do in any year is going to be dependent on market conditions and overall objectives, but I think that\u2019s a safe assumption to begin with.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay that\u2019s helpful. Any update on the same day ACH initiatives, I think some of those were supposed to start to be rolled out in Q4 or maybe tell us a little bit about charters, the solutions available for and how does the cost actually compare for consumers to this thing day versus the previous solution I think it was more in the neighborhood of four day settlements?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes, we have launched same day ACH in the fourth quarter, you\u2019re right, we were testing it on a limited basis. And we are now evaluating all customers who choose the bank funded options in our wu.com business for potentially funding instantly, it depends on whether you\u2019re approved based on your risks parameters. So we\u2019re doing it, we\u2019re not advertising it or marketing it heavily because we do want to make sure that we get the management of the risk around that business done right, but we\u2019ll be doing that more over the next--", "Hikmet Ersek", "But I will like to mention that we\u2019re doing that ACH -- same day ACH with selected and they\u2019re [proved] customers, we are just month to mid that was always a question about that.", "Raj Agrawal", "And the other thing I would just add is that, that\u2019s really just U.S based concept to instant ACH. We really are focus on expanding our business globally. We have over 10 markets now that have banks funding capability. We also deliver money into bank accounts into 50 markets around the world and we're continuing to expand those channels available to consumers. And the cost of transaction like that if its bank funded it can be relatively small but you need to make sure that you manage the risk around the funding of that transaction and the delivery time is going to be dependent. You really need to have both size of the equations you need to be able to fund instantly and you need to be able to deliver instantly for an instance transaction. And that\u2019s not necessarily available in every single market. ", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay understood and then just last question. I know you mentioned that specifically with the same day ACH were not doing much advertising and marketing around it. But can we just talk more broadly about advertising and marketing spend in 2015 versus 2014 any general trends or call out or growth expectations there?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well we're going to continue to invest in our brand obviously. Obviously our brand -- if you look at also product prices globally we are 15% to 20% premium. So there is a trust factor on our brand and we don\u2019t want to disappoint our customer. We want to invest the customers experience we will going to do that, we\u2019re upgrading our point of sales system one of them is that the [indiscernible] fast point of sales which you could see also the Walgreens locations and we are expending that in a different parts of the road. So the marketing is a big part of our business and also promoting the business on without [indiscernible] problem building the loyalty and we know that existing customers do more transactions if have them loyal so we are continue to invest these kinds of programs.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes Jason we've been spending about 4% of revenue the last few years on marketing the advertising. We'd expect something similar in '15.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Sterne Agee.", "Tom McCrohan", "I thought a year ago Hikmet you talked about getting into Walgreens and I think you just mentioned and two seconds ago. So are there other retailers that you're looking to get into the next few years that you can talk about?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes I think we are constantly looking at retail expansion. We have about similar to 750,000 locations, but as the customer your skills are changing we are doing also different types of retail upgrades Walgreens is definitely one example of that. But we recent built announce our apple pay usage at the retail location with apple pay you can use some locations already two transactions with ours. As you can see that I am really diversifying the use cases with different channels options is it retail or is it online or is this mobile and on the retail part we are definitely looking at expansion I believe still Asia is a big opportunity to expand. We recently find Bank of China which is a big sign it gives us 30,000 locations in China. So the expansion of point of sales is digital is it online, is it retail will continue.", "Tom McCrohan", "Thank you and just one last question on the pricing actions or potential future pricing actions. In Q3 of 2012 we announce those pricing actions; the transaction growth was when the zero was flat. Until now the total transaction growth slow to 2% so I just wanted to get some comfort that transaction growth saws further to zero there is not additional cross border pricing actions. Or how should we thinking about that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "As I said earlier that we believe that we have a competitive pricing and we believe that for the cross border money transfer we are very well position. But as you know we are in 16,000 corridors I don\u2019t if many other companies are like that. So what we do is that within the 16,000 corridors we'd that sort of a different brands we adapt our prices. And all these pricing actions we're going to continue to do we're going to do promotions we do foreign exchange we do adapt bands we are going to continue doing this things. But all are within our guidance for \u201815, I don\u2019t see big pricing investment especially in cross border for \u201815.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. ", "Bob Napoli", "I guess just looking at the big picture transaction trend, your transaction trends are still -- I mean they clearly slowed in I mean it seems like you're losing broadly some market share and continue to there is a number of fast growing companies. And different markets around the world they may not be generating the best margins, but have a lower pricing. How much market share loss will you accept and do you think there is going to be consolidation. Are if this some of these players that are charging lower prices around the world do you think they have sustainability such -- or do you think that they'll be significant industry consolidation globally.", "Hikmet Ersek", "First of all it's not about pricing obviously that\u2019s why we have a tight 15% to 20% premium, it\u2019s all manufactured. As you really say that this is complex being in 200 countries having regulatory license in 200 countries having different part on the money lending multi carrying settlement paying out in 121 currency, somebody has to build that, it\u2019s not easy to build that and I think we have extremely good cross boarder engine. So we have problem of that. I believe also that the business will be growing more on the digital environment but you have to build the engine first and we have the engine and what we\u2019re doing is that building on the engine, expanding on the digital part of the road to finding new customer used cases. On the market share I would like to mention also I think it\u2019s a principal amount what you\u2019re mentioning. I believe our targeted maintaining market share I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re losing market share and one example is Bank of Mexican which Raj mentioned in his starting comment we are building faster than the Bank of the Mexico. The pricing actions we put in place in 2012 and \u201813 definitely helped us and we are growing faster than the market.", "And the slowdown on the transaction was also -- remember we had actions on the \u201912 - \u201913, it\u2019s kind of the grow over we are not doing pricing actions anymore so we believe that we\u2019re going to summarize the comment I think we\u2019re going to maintain market share and I believe that we\u2019re going to grow very fast on digital.", "Raj Agrawal", "Bob, just the other thing I would add is on last year if you look at our principal growth, we grew principal at 5% and 6% on the constant currency basis and that\u2019s very much in line with the market growth from last year, so just to reiterate that point.", "Bob Napoli", "Good point, thank you. And on wu.com the pricing in transaction growth is narrow, that gap is narrowed or are you done with the aggressive pricing actions on wu.com and what are your thoughts on profitability? When does wu.com become profitable or it start to generate reasonable profit margins?", "Raj Agrawal", "Bob, this is Raj. On wu.com we do all times of testing on pricing and we\u2019re having a lot of good success there. So we\u2019ll keep testing, we\u2019ll keep doing pricing at different ban level different markets really to drive the customer adoption because our goal is to continue require more and more customers as you know 80% or more of the customers that are visiting us on wu.com are new to the franchise so we want to continue that customer acquisition machine if you will and in terms of profitability we know that we\u2019ve been spending disproportion of amount on both technology and marketing in that business, but we also know that the contribution of an incremental transaction on the margin basis is in the same range as in our retail business.", "So we know the business can grow. Profitability more than where it is today and also as we expand channels, as we have more bank touch points both on the funding and sending and receiving side that\u2019s going to allow us to drive better profitability as well.", "Bob Napoli", "And then last question, your B2C business had 15% constant currency growth and it\u2019s a really good acceleration is that sustainable and what is driving that type of growth are the margins -- are you going to be able to maintain margins with that kind of growth or expanding?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Let me start that Raj and then maybe you can add something, but our B2C business mainly from our Argentina business our U.S. business and electronic business and electronic part has been showing a good again a very good growth and that\u2019s basically the success story. Our cash business walk-in real payment business as expected declining but electronic is making up that one that\u2019s the success story there. ", "Raj Agrawal", "And the peso as a part of that equation we have the Argentina business which you have inflation there but then you also have the devaluation of the peso. So you do need to take that into account. But we did get acceleration on the reported growth as well 4%. And then on the margin that you asked about, on the margins, the margins have been impacted last year from the higher interchange cost so that\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to address but putting that aside we do think that we can continue to have good margins there and our goal is to improve the margins from where they have been in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar ", "I guess my first question is just trying to understand the hedge benefit that you have this year which kind of counting as roughly $0.10 to $0.12 it looks like what happens when the hedge is roll-off in 2016 does that 70 million in profit go away? I guess broadly, I\u2019m just understanding your hedging strategy.", "Raj Agrawal", "Hi, Ashwin. The hedges that we have in place for this year giving us that benefit. It\u2019s too early to talk about the impact in next year because it really is heavily dependent on where the currency markets will be and as you know based on what we\u2019ve seen in last three months that\u2019s not really predictable in nature. So we\u2019ll see where that actually ends up. We do have some hedges in place in 2016, but that overall impact is going to be hard to predict at this early stage.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay and it\u2019s fair enough. I have question on tax rate and the 6% tax rate this quarter you did mention some non-recurring items and then in response to a question you had said something about tax planning, so could you maybe provide some details on the non-recurring items and then the 13% I know the tax rate goes up from 12 this year, but I think everybody on the street pretty much expected it to be 15, so it is maybe $0.04 to $0.05 of benefit relative to street models, so I am trying to figure out is now -- is 13% now the new 15 is that the go forward tax rate and is that because of tax spend?", "Raj Agrawal", "Hi, Ashwin, I won\u2019t get into the details of which specific items drove our tax rate down in fourth quarter. Again on a go forward basis obviously we can\u2019t predict any new law or regulations or those things that maybe come into play, but putting that aside we think mid-teens is still the number that we would be targeting over the next few years.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay, so it can step back up and there is some temporary help you\u2019re getting this year?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay, the transaction growth question, I think part of the reason why Hikmet you\u2019re getting that question so much is because it seemed to decelerate 3Q to 4Q and pretty much every [GO]? And so I am kind of curious and hoping back to a previous question, again just trying to understand the rationale what does it take to -- especially as your competition evolves should you continue to carry that premium pricing that you have and that you have earned but with maybe different competition. Maybe that -- should that premium still exist down the road?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, Ashwin, you\u2019ve been following so long, you know the business very well. You know you EPS quarter by quarter, right?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Depending really on the counters and corridors as you know none of our countries has been also at U.S. more than 6% of our revenues, so it can very much diversify our pricing actions the 15% to 20% in an average. In some corridors, we are lower than the competition and some channels we\u2019re lower than competition, some channels we\u2019re higher than the competition. We really adapt our pricing to the used cases. I believe that the 15% to 20% price actions and overall that\u2019s an average. I think we have a good-good quality or you can\u2019t take one corridor saying that we\u2019re higher than the others, so you have to bring your prices down overall, right, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and that we have done for many years and very successfully.", "Even the 2012 pricing actions which we have done implemented. We said it will come back and it did come back and we bring us to the transaction growth. So I don\u2019t anticipate on today\u2019s point of view big pricing investment. And you know also and the digital wise, I believe you\u2019re going with the different channels of the digital side, I believe we\u2019re very competitive, being in 24 countries, sending money to 200 countries already open to many-many corridors to you and the customers value that you can drop money up anywhere world-wise in minutes in their currency. So there is -- I believe we have the right strategy here Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Yes, no problem with the service, I am a user, so definitely no problem, I am asking financial question more than anything else, well all the best guys. Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek", "We\u2019ve got time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay our final question will come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.", "Tim Willi", "I apologize for sticking with sort of the prior two questions but sort of again one the stream of market share and brand, if I could ask one question it would be, if you look at the brand Western Union which I think Ashwin talked about is well known, there is a premium, should that premium exist would have you, is there any thought process that maybe the brand needs to repositioned or we reinvigorated or a different message into the marketplace given the competitive dynamic that maybe need to be driven home a bit more than you feel like it is when you look at the transaction numbers and the growth numbers relative to sort of how we think about the market growing and the share that you have given up and appeared as be maybe slipping away again?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I am glad you asked the question, Tim, I wish we could have more time to answer that question, it\u2019s a brand thing. If you look at our brand we do have some different approach. We do position our products to the customer need. We are investing in product. We have the next phase product. We have account based money transfer product. We communicate that to customer differently. In some quarter, even have -- we have Vigo, we have Orlandi Valuta. We do serve the customers in a different brand, different communication, different need, so that\u2019s going to continue to happen in Western Union, in Western Union business so which we do serve the customer in a white label. We do use the third party and use our cost portal engine and we serve the customer in a need that it\u2019s not too important to brand.", "So that brand diversification will continue, today\u2019s brand, known brand to all of us is 90% of our business and fastest growing parts are the differentiation of the brand and repositioning the brand in a way that the new customer use cases needed.", "Mike Salop", "Tim this is Mike, I would just add, the slowdown from Q4 or Q3 to Q4 what certainly we have a comparative situation on domestic money transfer and there is some other corridors around the world where you could point to competition. The bigger picture is we think we're seeing some slowing economies in Europe and some other Russia and some other parts of the world and we know we have some compliance and taxes particularly in Asia and Africa that we're dealing with. So those are contributing to the good part of the change from Q4 -- Q3 and Q4. ", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think Mike should point also that as I said earlier I stay cautious of geo-political and economical environment for 2015.", "Mike Salop", "Thanks everyone for joining us appreciate it. And have a good afternoon.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Mike Salop", "Thank you Emily. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the Company's 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results and the 2016 outlook and then we will take your questions. The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at WesternUnion.com under the investor relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2014 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Thank you, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. We delivered solid earnings, despite global economic and geopolitical challenges which demonstrates the resiliency of our consumers and business model.", "Full-year earnings per share increased 5% in 2015, adjusting for our second quarter payment settlement charge and all three of our business segments produced relatively good constant currency revenue growth during the year. Consumer-to-consumer revenues increased 3% in constant currency, with slight growth in retail-initiated money transfer, boosted by very strong results from digital, as WesternUnion.com constant currency revenues increased 26% for the year.", "Western Union business solutions constant currency revenue increased 7% and the segment's EBITDA margins improved from 11% to 15%. And consumer bill payments also contributed a strong year, with constant currency revenue growing 11%.", "From a macro perspective, while the U.S. market was solid, many other parts of the world experienced slowing economic growth, depreciating currencies or geopolitical instability in 2015 and low oil prices affected several send markets. As a result of many of these factors we saw significant outbound declines in markets such as Russia, Angola, Greece and Libya.", "Despite this, transactions and constant currency revenue in our retail money transfer business increased slightly, showing the ongoing importance of cash to consumers around the world, while they continued to drive strong growth from our digital business. Operating margins increased from 20.3% to 20.9%, excluding the charge. And cash flow was strong again, with approximately $1.1 billion generated from operating activities and over $800 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we also announced a 3% increase in our first quarter dividend which equates to $0.64 per share annually and we remain committed to consistently returning funds to shareholders.", "In addition to the financial results, we made important progress in key strategic areas in 2015. Our strategies are designed to leverage our platform and other capabilities to allow us to access more use cases and customer segments for cross-border money movements. In 2015, we continued our digital expansion, adding 10 new WesternUnion.com online transaction sites which raised our total to 34 countries. We introduced WU Connect which allows us to offer cross-border money transfer services on third-party platforms, such as social media and messaging companies, among others.", "We signed our first WU Connect partnership in 2015 with WeChat, a leading Chinese social communications platform and we just announced our second with Viber, a leading mobile messaging app which will make our money transfer service available to their consumers here in the U.S. We're in the process of putting promotional programs in place with both partners and we believe these offerings will generate incremental revenues over the long term. We also made additional investments in our technology in 2015 to position us for the future and rolled out further compliance and anti-money laundering enhancements.", "And we expanded our account payout network which will allow us to target account-driven receivers in the future. This is an important new potential revenue source for Western Union, as funds into accounts make up the largest portion of the cross-border principal pool and we now have the capability to send to over 1 billion accounts into 50-plus countries.", "We will talk more about our strategic initiatives at our investors day in March, but let me turn now to our 2016 outlook. We expect global economic growth to be challenging and currencies to be volatile again in 2016 and we believe we will continue to deal with external challenges and disruptions in various countries. The stronger dollar is also going to affect our reported results.", "We remain confident, however, that our multi-channel business mode delivers solid transactions and constant currency revenue growth this year, with strong cash flow and continued returns of funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We anticipate good constant currency growth from WesternUnion.com and business solutions again in 2016 and steady performance from retail money transfer. Over the long term, we believe the unique combination of our strong global brand, our base network and our cross-border expertise and capabilities, give us great opportunities to expand our reach in cross-border money movements, including adding new use cases with our WU Connect and account payout platforms. I will now like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and 2016 outlook in more detail.", "Raj Agrawal", "Thank you, Hikmet. As I review 2015 financial results, I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules.", "Fourth quarter revenues of $1.4 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior-year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due of the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately $74 million, compared to the prior-year period. In the consumer-to-consumer segment revenues increased 2% constant currency and recorded revenues declined 3%, while transactions grew 3% in the quarter.", "C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by WesternUnion.com and solid growth from U.S. outbound. In the quarter total C2C cross-border principal declined 4% or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 6% compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to foreign exchange translation as it decreased 1% in constant currency terms.", "The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 6 percentage points, including a negative 5% impact from currency. The impact of net price decreases was 1%, while mix had minimal impact in the quarter overall. The pricing environment remains stable and our net C2C pricing change for the full year was essentially flat.", "Turning to the regions, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 8%, but was flat on a constant currency basis. Transactions increased 1%. In the region, strong revenue growth in Germany was largely offset by continued weakness in Russia. The Greece business improved compared to the third quarter, as the market-imposed restrictions were largely lifted, although revenue was still below prior-year levels.", "North America revenue was flat or increased 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 5%. U.S. outbound continued to deliver strong growth in the quarter, driven primarily by spend to Mexico and Latin America. Our Mexico business again grew faster than the market, based on the latest Banco de Mexico data for both the fourth quarter and full year. The domestic money transfer business produced improved trends in the quarter, as transactions increased 8%, while revenue growth turned positive, with a 2% increase.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 5% or 1% constant currency and transactions were down 1%. Similar to the third quarter, declines in Angola and other African countries were offset growth in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6% or up 1% constant currency, while transactions in the region decreased 5% and continued weakness in the Philippines was partially offset by good growth in Japan and China.", "Revenue in the Latin American and Caribbean region was down 2% or increased 5% constant currency, while transactions increased 7% in the quarter. The region's constant currency growth was primarily driven by strong inbound business, from the U.S. WesternUnion.com C2C revenue grew 21% in the quarter or 25% constant currency. WesternUnion.com transactions increased 28%, with U.S. originated online transactions at 35%.", "Electronic channels revenue which includes WU.com, account-based money transfer through banks and mobile money transfer represented 7% of total Company revenue in the quarter. I do want to mention that we will be making a slight change to our regional reporting for C2C in the first quarter. Rather than separating the WesternUnion.com business from the regions, we will begin reporting it within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions. With online transaction sites now in 34 countries, we believe this will give a better perspective on total regional performance, while we will still continue to provide the WesternUnion.com standalone metrics as additional information.", "Turning back to the fourth quarter, in the consumer-to-business segment, revenue increased 4% or 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-ins. Business solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 8% on a constant currency basis. This revenue growth was driven by Europe and led by strong sales of hedging products.", "The consolidated operating profit margin was 20.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to 19.6% in the prior-year period. The operating margin benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and from foreign exchange hedge gains. These benefits were partially offset by higher technology expense in the quarter.", "We recorded approximately $21 million of hedge gains on our revenue and profit lines in the current period, up from $9 million of gains in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our cost savings initiatives, we had approximately $11 million in expenses in the quarter on actions to drive future cost efficiencies which compares to approximately $30 million of such expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, prior cost savings initiatives contributed approximately $6 million of incremental savings in the fourth quarter and full-year total savings were approximately $32 million.", "Technology spending and investment increased compared to the prior year, as we invested in enhancements to our platforms, digital capabilities, settlement systems and data center transformation, all of which will continue in 2016. Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 3.6% in the prior-year period. For the full year, compliance expense was 3.6% of revenue.", "EBITDA margin of 25.4% in the quarter increased from 24.5% in the prior-year period. Our tax rate was 10.4% and increased from 6.1% in last year's fourth quarter which benefited from various non-recurring items. For the full year, our reported tax rate was 11%. Excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement charges in the second quarter, the full-year effective tax rate was 11.8%. Earnings per share in the quarter was flat with last year at $0.42 net increased operating profit and fewer diluted shares outstanding were offset by the increased tax rate.", "The C2C segment operating margin was 24% compared to 23.1% in the prior-year period. C2C operating margin also benefited from lower expenses and incremental savings related to cost savings initiatives and foreign exchange hedge gains which were partially offset by higher technology expense. The consumer-to-business operating margin was 11.9% in the quarter, compared to 14.2% in the prior-year period.", "The margin decrease was due to the higher local currency expenses in Argentina, including various inflation adjustments and increased technology expense which were partially offset by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives. Business solutions reported operating profit of $4 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $5 million for the same period last year.", "The operating profit improvement was driven by lower expenses and incremental savings from cost initiatives, depreciation and amortization for business solutions with approximately $13 million in both the current and prior year quarters. EBITDA margins for business solutions improved to 16.2% compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion for the year. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the fourth quarter and $267 million for the year which equates to just under 5% of revenues. At the end of the quarter, the Company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.3 billion.", "The Company utilized U.S. cash to pay off the $250 million debt maturity during the fourth quarter. As a result, approximately 30% of the cash was held by the United States entities as of quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $69 million.", "Our remaining authorization which expires in December of 2017, was $712 million at year end. The outstanding share count at the end of the year was 502 million shares. We also paid $78 million in dividends in the quarter and we're pleased to announce today a further 3% increase in our quarterly dividend.", "Turning to the 2016 outlook, as Hikmet mentioned, we expect continued steady constant currency results from retail money transfer and good performance from our growth areas such as WesternUnion.com. We expect the C2C pricing environment to remain stable with strategic pricing adjustments similar to last year. Our money transfer consumers have been resilient which has a given us a reliable business model and solid earnings and cash flow generation, even in some difficult economic periods.", "Our outlook does reflect a challenging macroeconomic environment in many parts of the world and negative impact from a stronger dollar relative to 2015 average rates. Specifically, we anticipate foreign currency changes and reduced hedge benefits will negatively impact revenues by approximately $250 million and operating profit by approximately $100 million compared to 2015 rates, including the impact of hedges. The outlook is primarily based on recent exchange rates, with the euro assumed at $1.08.", "The estimated $100 million profit impact results from just over $25 million of reduced hedge benefits compared to 2015, approximately $25 million related to Argentina and the remainder from translation of profits in various currencies around the world. We expect a benefit of approximately $50 million from foreign exchange currency hedge gains in 2016, but this is down from the $78 million of benefit achieved in 2015. So the year-on-year impact on profit and margins from hedges is negative.", "In Argentina, the peso devalued in late December, as new economic policies were implemented and its value is now more than 30% lower than the average rates for 2015. We have both money transfer and bill payments businesses in Argentina which represent about 4% of Company revenues last year. So the devaluation translates to approximately $100 million of revenue impact and approximately $25 million of operating profit impact.", "We expect compliance expense in a range of 3.5% to 4% which is similar to last year. The margin outlook also reflects over $50 million of incremental technology expense, as we make further investments in our capabilities. Otherwise, given the challenges from currency, we're managing expenses very tightly.", "Excluding all impacts from foreign exchange rate movements, the outlook for operating margins in 2016 would be similar to 2015. Achieving our outlook operating margin in 2016 would mark the fourth consecutive year of margins around 20%, with currency contributing to the step up to 21% in 2015 and driving the anticipated step back to approximately 20% this year.", "We have worked hard to stabilize margins over the last few years, in what has been a relatively low-growth reported revenue environment paired with rising compliance costs and we're pleased with our progress. We expect the tax rate to increase from 11.8% in 2015, excluding the Paymap charge, to a mid-teens level in 2016. And we expect the rate to be somewhat higher in the first half of the year than the second.", "Putting this all together, our initial 2016 outlook calls for low to mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth, with GAAP revenue approximately 400 basis points lower than the constant currency growth; operating margin of approximately 20%; earnings-per-share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70 which includes at approximately $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange and also reflects the impact of a higher tax rate; and cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1 billion.", "Similar to last year, the cash flow outlook excludes approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to our IRS agreement, some or all of which may occur in late 2016. We anticipate completing the remaining $712 million of our buyback authorization over the course of 2016 and 2017 and we also plan to issue additional debt to at least partially replace the $1 billion note maturity in 2016.", "So to summarize we were pleased to deliver our results in 2015, despite a tough environment. We expect to drive stable performance and continued strong cash flow generation and allocation in 2016, while we execute our strategies to drive long-term growth. So with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Can you hear me okay? I'm at the airport. Just on the margins flat margins excluding the foreign exchange effects in 2016, it sounds like you're including a $50 million tech expense there?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "So I mean I guess is that what's holding back margin expansion that we would normally see, maybe with higher positive revenue growth and the other puts and takes there that I may have missed?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes, Tien-tsin. The margins would have been about the same as last year, without the currency impact. And that includes about a $50 million increase in spend in technology. We're saving other costs during the course of this year and that's why we're able to keep relatively flat margins. But certainly, if we had not had that kind of an increase in technology, then margins could have been better. But we're investing in our platforms and upgrading our core processing technology which is a little bit dated and we think that's the right thing to be doing.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Okay. Understood and then maybe if I could just as a follow-up, just M&A appetite or update there? I know there's a lot of news flow in the quarter related to that. What's the latest thinking on M&A?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally we always, like in the past, we look at M&A opportunities as it fits up with our strategy, definitely interested in digital environment or mobile environment and that environment we continue to look. It has to be -- fit with our strategy and we're very disciplined also on return on M&As and so we're going to continue to look at that. I mean, I don't plan big M&As, but definitely strategic fit will be within our focus area.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Keane", "Just want to follow up on that, Raj. Just thinking about the $50 million in incremental technology investment spend. Is there something that's a complete opposite to that, like the cost saving initiatives? I don't know if you gave a number for that to expect in FY '16? Just trying to figure what if there's anything in detail to offset that incremental, to keep margins flat?", "Raj Agrawal", "We haven't really given any detail on that, but these are general cost reductions and other savings that we're doing and that's really what's allowing us to offset some of that expense for the most part, Bryan.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay. And then, pricing was down, I think, 1% in the fourth quarter, but flat for the year. Was there some pricing initiatives taken in the fourth quarter? And then going forward, will pricing be more flat again? Just want to make sure I understand it. Thanks.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes. The pricing that you saw in the fourth quarter is nothing out of the ordinary. We still expect a low single-digit pricing environment during the course of this year. Earlier in the year, we had some price increases that were offsetting some of the price declines that we had, so it's really just normal course price changes in the market.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Market looks also quite stable, Bryan so we don't anticipate big pricing investment. The usual ones, but not big ones.", "Bryan Keane", "Okay. And then just last one for me, Raj, is there a way to think about the three segments in terms of constant currency, how to model them going forward in 2016?", "Raj Agrawal", "We haven't really given a segment breakout, but for the B2B business, we still believe long-term that opportunities for low double-digit constant currency revenue growth and that's really a long-term objective. We, overall, the business we expect to be in the low to mid single-digit constant currency growth range for the Company.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Raj Agrawal", "But from a business unit standpoint we haven't really--", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think generally, we will see very strong growth coming from the digital send transaction, combined with our network worldwide, that drives really the growth, especially being in 34 countries it's very strong and our U.S. business, as you saw, U.S. outbound online business has been very strong and now we're in 34 countries. We expect long-term also similar growth rates like we have in the U.S. globally and we're going to continue to expand that one.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Cary", "This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. With all the global macro volatility we've seen lately, I was hoping you could provide just some additional color about embedded expectations in 2016 by region. Just if there's any particular regions that you think could grow accelerate or any that are probably going to be particularly hard hit by some of the headwinds that we've seen?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think generally our business is quite resilient. Our customers are quite resilient, even through 2015 economic challenges, the currency volatility, the geopolitical issues, our business and customers has been very resilient. We did see some impact of our global and geopolitical issues, like in Russia, we saw it in Angola, we saw it in Greece. In Libya. These outbound countries had some effect to our revenues, but given, being in 200 countries, I feel quite comfortable to manage that risk.", "However, there is a huge geopolitical oil prices maybe also have impact in the Middle East outbound business long term. And generally, year to date and last year we saw a quite solid business and our customers are growing -- our growth was also coming from new incremental revenue, new customer segment, adding on that, with our online business, with our mobile business growing really strong. And these are new customers and it's not cannibalizing our strong retail money transfer business which is resilient.", "Ryan Cary", "Okay and then looking at the WU Connect platform, I know you've announced a couple partners since launching. I was hoping you could speak broadly to the feedback you have received from potential partners and maybe on top of that how long do you estimate it will take to start getting some more significant traction within this new channel?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, it's definitely something that we built over the years, WU Connect which has API connection to our platform which the platform is basically our multi-settlement currency platform, our compliance platform, our IT platform. We now give the platform, make it capable for social media and for operators, messaging operators, that they have an access and use that. To build that takes years to have license 200 countries. It's not easy.", "And in the past we're opening that platform, there is a kind of a closed platform, for our agents. Now we're opening this platform also, for new social media. One is WeChat obviously and another one as just announced a week ago was Viber and it will take some time, as you know, it takes some time. We have to promote that within the users, within the people who use Viber and WeChat and other social medias. We would like to expand that also to the other social medias, but we have just put programs. One of the recent programs is the Chinese New Year, as you know, yesterday was Chinese New Year and we started promotion with WeChat which is a Chinese communication platform and we'll see the results long-term, definitely incremental results.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller", "I mean overall I think the constant currency trades look fairly stable on most of the businesses. The exceptions I guess look like they are the markets you called out, just in the last question, around the outbound markets, being somewhat oil sensitive markets, Middle East and Asia to some extent. I guess Asia maybe a little bit less. But just give us some color on what your embedded expectations are for those markets?", "I mean I guess a lot of the copies we see reporting are having a pretty big concerns over those economies, obviously. And when we take it a step further in the U.S., there's parts of the U.S. outbound market, I know, that have historically been somewhat tied to oil-producing areas in the U.S. as well, whether or not that's embedded in your thoughts? So a little color on the expectation for transaction growth in Asia be down 5%, Mideast down 1% and whether that's potentially going to get better or worse in the U.S., also?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I mean if you look at our business, U.S. has been really very solid and even in Saudi Arabia and UAE, we saw good transactions in Germany, we saw good transactions -- I have to be fair Germany is not oil-producing country, but the numbers have been very solid. Saudi Arabia and Middle East, Gulf countries which has a huge outbound business has been stable.", "Definitely there is some risk looking forward on these areas maybe have some -- oil prices are down, maybe some economic challenges, but I feel quite confident with our resiliency of our business, of our customers. And also, we're start, you'll see some announcements, additional announcements to our 34 countries adding new online capabilities, especially also Middle East, for customers to be able to send not only retail money transfer, but also online money transfer. I believe that will keep that stable.", "There is some concerns on the economic challenges. There is, global environment is not stable. I'm cautious about that. But customers, don't forget also not of our countries out of the U.S. are bigger than 7%, Raj? I believe revenue, so our portfolio is quite diverse. With that, we manage with marketing actions, with promotions, we really drive our constant currency revenue at least, as you said, biggest impact on the GAAP is the currency impact for next year.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay. I mean, so it sounds like your expectation is for something similar to what we're seeing now, more or less? Or you're not expecting much worse? Okay.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes.", "Darrin Peller", "And then just on the other non-C2C segment C2B and the business solutions segment, again, I guess it's nice to see those constant currency revenue growth rates still at the high single digits. Any thought we could have on the macro factors? I mean I know generally FX volatility has been an impactful driver on the business solutions side of the business. Anything that's impacting that there or anything else we should think about, given all the volatility in macro we're hearing across the board?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I mean, it's not like 2014 or before the global trade is growing very strong. There is some growth, but trade is not as we would like to see. And as you know, our B2B business is dependent on global trade activities. But I have to say that in Europe, especially the B2B business, we're doing pretty well. At our markets where we're active like UK or other markets like France and Continental Europe, the team has been doing a good job here and growing pretty well. There is, as you know, there is something global trade could be impacting our business but currently, I don't see big changes.", "Raj Agrawal", "I would also add, Darrin, hedging has also helped some of the results there and that activity continues to expand into more markets around the world.", "Darrin Peller", "And just last question for me I'll turn it back to the queue is on the tax rate. I know it comes up this year to a more normalized mid-teens level. I guess just big picture on that, I mean, I imagine that should slowly but surely move to a high double -- more closer to 20%? Is that the right way to think about it for modeling purposes over the next couple of years?", "Raj Agrawal", "I can't speak to your model, but for us, we believe that the mid-teens tax rate is something that we would still have for the next couple of years. Obviously it's dependent upon tax law changes in other things that may happen, but based on what we know today, that's roughly where we see the tax rate. And this year is coming out to be right where we said. During the course of last year, we thought we would be back in the mid-teens and we're and that's what we see for the next couple of years.", "Darrin Peller", "Okay so mid-teens is pretty stable now.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Sara Gubins", "Some questions on commission expense. Is this a year that we should expect an outsized amount of agent renewals and how should we think about commission expense for the year?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sara, well, if you look at our business, if not that we have one year that commission goes up, the other year commission goes down. Normally our agent agreements are four, five, multi-year agreements. Right? And so it comes -- every year comes agent renewals.", "I don't expect that big changes in 2016, on the commissions. I believe not that the commissions rates will go up or down. I mean sometimes there are some years go up, some years go down, but major changes won't happen, Sarah.", "Raj Agrawal", "I mean, last year, Sara, we actually had a decline in commission rates, retail commission rates. And this year we expect that commission rates will be relatively stable, as Hikmet said, to last year. And really longer-term the opportunities are around reducing distribution costs as the mix of our business changes, as we have more of rank funding, more bank payout, that's going to naturally shift the overall distribution costs of the Company.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Absolutely.", "Sara Gubins", "Following up on that, I know it's really early, but any chance you could help us think about to the economics of WU Connect over time?", "Raj Agrawal", "I mean, it's really early as you said, Sara. We haven't really gotten into those details. The model itself, there's likely to be some profit-sharing mechanism with a partner and the pricing for transactions could be similar to WU.com for similar channels. And then we do believe that these relationships could have a captive audience that we're marketing to versus the rest of our business, because these are customers that are using these messaging apps and if we're embedded in the messaging app, it makes it a little bit easier to find us, if you will, to use our services. So there's some opportunities here, but too early to talk about specific economics.", "Hikmet Ersek", "And our assumption, Sara, here is also like investing in dot-com. These are additional incremental consumers, additional revenue. We don't expect huge cannibalization, but time will tell us, our first search and first understanding is that these are incremental customers and revenues.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "So the tech spending on your network and processing infrastructure, I guess, the question is, why now? Is it a competitive response to newer choices in the market like transfer wise or what's the benefit you get from the investment? And while you are discussing technology I guess a question we do get from investors is impact of block chain. If you could spend a couple of minutes talking about the technology, that would help.", "Raj Agrawal", "Sure, the tech spending is not a this-year item only. We have been ramping up our tech spending. We have some older platforms that are in place, so we're upgrading our data center, data centers, around the world and in the United States. We're also upgrading our settlement system and we're upgrading our core processing capabilities, so it is definitely in an effort to upgrade our older technology, but it also is going to allow us to be more flexible in the market as we move forward and as we have newer kind of partners. So it is really setting us up for growth the next several years. And then from a block chain standpoint, Hikmet, do you want to add something?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes I think we're always looking at technologies like block chain and we also look at can we look -- adapt the block chain in our system and everything. But as you know, Ashwin, our system is unique. The success of our system is that it works in 200 countries, it can pay out in 121 currencies. It can adapt to regulatory systems of 200 countries and make anti-money laundering and process 22 transactions, does how many transactions a second we said? Raj?", "Raj Agrawal", "More than that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "More than that. I don't know. Every second transaction, so the flexibility of our system is there. It's hard to beat that and we're adapting that, exactly what Raj said, that we're adapting our systems to the given environment.", "If the block chain is the better one, we will definitely look at it, but our team is very innovative here and Denver and in San Francisco and really looking at our capabilities. I'm quite confident that we're -- we made big steps last two, three years in our technology and going to continue to invest. Otherwise companies like WeChat or Viber or banks, big banks like La Banque Postale or like big retailers won't work with us. They want to have the customer experience good and they want to connect to our systems, so that's what we're doing.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "On a separate point, you've been stable at these transaction growth rates for a couple of quarters here. At what point do you decide that the growth rate just isn't good enough? And that maybe a price cut makes more strategic sense? It would seem like the current environment, you are not growing, but it may be your smaller competitors might be suffering a little more, so maybe it might be time to take advantage of that. How do you feel about that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "With all respect, I would like to push back on your growth comment. Maybe in retail money transfer, the transactions are slow growth, but as you know, our WesternUnion.com and digital business is growing very fast. I believe in many markets we're beating the competition and we're very competitive here and I'm very proud of the team. Even in the U.S. which we have been so long in WesternUnion.com, growing I think the transaction last quarter grow 33% or 34%?", "Raj Agrawal", "28% overall transaction growth, 35% U.S. origination.", "Hikmet Ersek", "U.S. originated transaction 35%. These are quite impressive numbers, so I believe that we're doing the right thing on our online business. And if you compare our business in electronic channels, of about 7% of our revenue, it's a quite big business and if you compare that with other competitors, their absolute numbers are definitely not there and they are only active on a few corridors.", "Their expansion capabilities is, they don't have the WU Connect platform, their expansion capabilities is I believe not there yet and we're very proud of our platform and I think we're going to continue to expand there. You will hear more announcements, Ashwin, on expansion on digital. Especially on digital you hear more partners and at the same time, you will also hear more WesternUnion.com countries coming on our platform.", "Raj Agrawal", "Ashwin, I wanted to add to what Hikmet said. The lower growth that we're seeing in the transactions right now is really reflective of the continued global environments around us. I mean, we last year, we had a softer environment globally. We continue to see that this year, so things haven't really changed. It's really reflective of that more than the pricing need.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jordan Fox", "This is Jordan on for Jim. I apologize that I missed this, but I just wanted to ask you about the current pricing environment both in the U.S. and Mexico corridor, following MoneyGram's contract expansion with Walmart. Any incremental there that you could point out? And then also in WU.com, have you seen any increment the pricing pressure, as it relates to Xoom following PayPal's acquisition? Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sure. As a Raj mentioned earlier, first of all on the Mexico, Latin America U.S. to Mexico corridor, obviously Banco de Mexico data shows that we're definitely doing better than the market and that's not the first time and that's been very consistent over the last quarters and I'm very proud of the team that they are doing a good job. We will -- we're going to continue to do corridor by corridor pricing, sweet corridor quarter pricing, really very intelligent pricing, to attract new customers to compete on that, but I don't see big pricing changes. I really see the pricing environment quite stable.", "On online, when we enter to a new market, in our online business, we may do some promotions to enter in the market to promote our channel there, but overall, I would say that the market environment has been stable. Look, no one can send money from one corner to 200 corners, like if you're from Denver to 200 countries, in our 500,000, in 100,000 ATMs, now also 1 billion accounts, dropping money really in a fast, very efficient way in 131 currencies. So that's what we're doing.", "It's not all about price, the customers like our product and they're really working on that. So the last question was on WU.com pricing. As I mentioned on the WU.com pricing, I believe that we will continue to do promotions, like we have been very successful on India promotions. And that our aim is always profitable, being profitable and in all lines, we're making money, just I want to make this point that we do make money and we're increasing our margins also in online and getting profitable.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.", "Kevin McVeigh", "In terms of the uptick in that tax rate, what's the actual EPS impact to that, in terms of just how much of that impact is 2016 guidance?", "Raj Agrawal", "We haven't given that, Kevin. We're going from a roughly a 12% tax rate last year to mid-teens, so I'll let you just do the math behind that. But you can easily calculate that impact, if you will.", "Kevin McVeigh", "Okay. I didn't know if there was any kind of nuances in there. And then just in terms of the continued spending on the compliance side, the 3.5% to 4%, is it the same type of spend and is that independent of the technology spend or is that all wrapped in one?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes. It's similar type of spend. The well over half of the spending is for people costs and we have over 2,000 people in the compliance organization here at Western Union. We obviously have them in various centers around the world so that's where a lot of the spending is. But we're continuing to invest in technology and outside services to optimize our spending there as much as we can, so -- but it is largely the same kind of spending, but just it -- this is a global effort if you will, so we're going to continue to expand these programs around the world.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Tom McCrohan", "What's your expectations this year for total growth in cross-border principal? Which I think end of the year constant currency about 1%.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes. Well, the World Bank has estimated principal growth to be 1% this year, but as we know, that information is more directional than anything else and as the data continues to come in and get updated, so we'll see where that ultimately ends up. Last year, our principal grew by 2% on a constant currency basis and then was down 5% on a reported basis.", "Tom McCrohan", "Okay. And can you give us a sense for the proportion of your total cross-border principal that is oil sensitive or emanating from oil-producing countries?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes. I mean, if you look at the oil-producing countries in which we operate, the revenue generated from those countries is in the 10% to 15% range and it's really a mixed story. In those oil-producing nations, as Hikmet mentioned earlier, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have continued to thus far show decent growth, but we have other markets like Angola, Libya and others that are having, Russia as well, that are just having a challenging time.", "So it's really a mixed bag and then the broader impacts from lower oil prices in other outbound markets is also a mixed story. We have had good growth in some key outbound markets as a result, I think, of just those kinds of situations. So -- but generally a 10% to 15% of revenues is from oil-producing nations.", "Tom McCrohan", "And the trends post the end of the quarter in Saudi Arabia and UAE -- are they still similar to what you experienced during the quarter?", "Raj Agrawal", "Well, we don't give any intra quarter information, but from the fourth quarter, that's where we saw the growth, so nothing to update really at this stage.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead. ", "Bob Napoli", "With your competitors signing a new contract with Walmart, I think that contract -- the old contract excluded Walmart from talking to Western Union, I believe. And this contract, I think, was less exclusive the prior one. So I just wondered if you had -- if there were any thoughts if Western Union was increasingly interested in Walmart, if you think -- maybe leave it there and get an answer to that question. And follow-up.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Good question, but as you know, we don't make any comments on any negotiations or any other specific partnership capabilities, as you could imagine, from competitive reasons and generally I don't do that. But I just can tell you that I'm interested in on any partner to grow out my business.", "I believe that we will look always to grow our business and to -- but it has to be profitable. It has to pay back not for any price and we want to get new customers. We want to get additional customers and we will definitely look at any potential partnership worldwide, anywhere.", "Bob Napoli", "You are not excluded from any of your other partners from working with Walmart and do think of non-exclusive sends are the way of the future in the U.S.?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, generally I would say that from -- I can only speak for my business, the exclusivity, generally when the exclusivity has been very stable and our top 40 agents or 35 agents have been exclusive more than 18 years. And most of the agents are choosing this, because they know they have quite stable partners, financially stable, good anti-money-laundering system, good settlement system, long-range capability, great brands and they can drop money in 200 countries immediately, so the activities comes in both sides obviously and they would like to protect good partnership for longer-term. We have also host-to-host connections, we have IT implementation with our partners and so I feel from my part of business quite comfortable on this.", "Bob Napoli", "And you're not excluded from working with Walmart, from like Kroger or any of your other partners?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I can't answer that question but I guess not. I don't know. You have to ask that question to the others, not to me.", "Bob Napoli", "Okay and Raj, you have -- you mentioned $1 billion of debt coming due in 2016. With credit spread having widened so much, is there any -- what would be the impact if you were to refinance that debt today on your interest expense?", "Raj Agrawal", "Taking everything into account, Bob, we see interest expense being similar to last year. So potentially higher interest rates for that refinancing, but we have a lower overall average debt balances this year, as we paid off some maturities from last year. So those two things would largely offset, I would expect to see interest expense similar to last year.", "Bob Napoli", "Okay. And then last question, with your Investor Day coming up and why now for the Investor Day? And are you planning on giving any medium to longer term financial targets as part of your Investor Day?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, as you know, our Investor Day is coming beginning of March. And we're very proud about our strategies, what we want to tell to our shareholders or really how we transformed the company, how we get to the new use cases, how we get the new our WU Connect platform, how our strength -- strong about retail money transfer business. And we would also like to talk to the uniqueness of the Western Union cross-border engine, cross-border platform and I think within that environment, we would like to talk to our long-term and loyal shareholders, how comfortable we feel about the future of the Company.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Hussain of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Hussain", "Just another one on that $50 million tax spend. I know it's early to talk about 2017, but I just wanted to get a sense for whether the $50 million is elevated in any way or whether this is maybe a go-forward investment rate for now?", "Raj Agrawal", "Well, the $50 million certainly has some one-time costs in there, but again, we're trying to upgrade our platforms, so there's also some ongoing costs in that spend. As we add more partners to the mix, especially on the digital side, partners like Viber and WeChat, as we have more of those, we will continue to invest in the technology areas. So too early to say whether it's only one-time in nature or how much of it is one-time in nature.", "I expect some elevated tech spending to continue, but again, that allows us to be faster to market. It allows us to be more flexible in how we provide services and it also allows us to add new kinds of partners to our business which is really why we're doing it.", "Daniel Hussain", "And then not to beat a dead horse on oil, but I'll try to ask the question a different way. Saudi Arabia I think they are the second largest send market and they did cut their budget in December. So at this point, are you taking a wait-and-see approach for your expectations for 2016, even if you haven't seen any impact yet? Or are you baking in some sort of headwind now?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes, I think generally I'm cautious. Right? About the global economic, it's not Saudi Arabia specific. But generally there is -- the environment didn't get better. It's very volatile. But once again, I just want to make the point, one of our countries from a revenue side is bigger, outside the U.S., bigger than 7%, so we have a really quite balanced environment.", "I mean, as Raj mentioned earlier, Germany for instance produced pretty good outbound numbers again which is obviously engine of Europe and continued to produce that. So I feel comfortable that being that global, having that portfolio, we could respond better than the other companies to the economic challenges.", "Daniel Hussain", "Okay. And then if I could just follow up on Darrin's earlier question on tax, this issue does come up a lot for us. So just wondering if it's possible to provide maybe an example of one of these working capital strategies that you use to repatriate cash, without paying the U.S. Marshal impact.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yes. I would say is that we move a lot of money around the world annually, we move hundreds of billions of dollars around the world globally on an annual basis and we have a lot of payment flows between our various companies around the world, so we try to optimize those as best as we can. And I'm happy to talk more about that off-line if you would like to, but it's really just optimizing the cash flows that we have within the Company.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Tim Willi", "Two questions, one Raj, I missed the full comment but could you just go back over the $25 million of headwind from Argentina? I didn't catch that, I just want to make sure that I understand it. I have a follow-up.", "Raj Agrawal", "Sure. I think you are referring to -- this year we have an overall impact from currency on profit of about $100 million. $25 million of that is from the Argentine peso devaluation that took place in December of last year. Another $25 million plus is from year-over-year changes in hedge gains, so we have hedge gains this year that are less than last year. So last year we had $78 million in hedge gains. This year we have around $50 million based on our current rate assumptions and that's a negative to the margins.", "And then the remaining piece of it is just overall translation, so we have a revenue impact of $250 million in our top line this year and $100 million impact to profits and that combination is a negative to our operating margins this year of around 100 basis points. And Argentina is just a translation of our profits is going to translate into $25 million less just based on the devaluation of the currency.", "Tim Willi", "My follow-up, going sort of WesternUnion.com and the global expansion that you seem to be moving on here more aggressively. Is there anything around reallocating marketing budgets or elevated levels of marketing or anything like that, as you really open up this platform, that we should think about in terms of operating leverage, whether pros or cons, as you roll this out more globally and really try to accelerate it?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yes. I think, absolutely. I think, we're focused on the send countries, major send countries, obviously. The 34 countries which I mentioned earlier are the major send countries. Now we're -- we have almost all European countries, obviously now we're starting to have -- by the way in Europe, we're using our bank license there and to expand WesternUnion.com and now the next step is, in Europe are putting promotions and marketing programs there, to drive the revenue even stronger which is a good strong -- the base is still small, but growing stronger.", "And now we recently opened an office in Asia to expand our activities, also WesternUnion.com activities to send Asian countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, but also in Middle East, like typical countries in the Middle East, outbound countries. And you'll hear coming up new announcements on that using our capabilities and I believe it's really attracting new customer segments. For instance, people who want to send in a different way, don't want to carry cash in a location and we saw the similar pattern also in Europe, these are additional customers, not ones that use retail, but still you want to use Western Union and add additional growth and that's going to happen, I believe, also in Asia.", "Tim Willi", "So are you comfortable in terms of the P&L impact, that there is not any pressure on margins? This'll just be reallocated your existing marketing budget to different channels and countries? Not anything necessarily incremental -- at a material level?", "Raj Agrawal", "Tim from a marketing standpoint, we've been spending just under 4% of revenues as a Company for the last few years, but we have been reallocating more to the digital areas and that will probably continue, but not affecting the overall budget.", "Operator", "Our last question today is from Oscar Turner of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Oscar Turner", "So you mentioned that overall, you expect C2C pricing trends to remain stable in 2016. I was just wondering if you could provide some general color on the proportion of markets where you are typically able to raise prices versus perhaps those that are more competitive?", "Raj Agrawal", "We have 60,000 corridors that we operate in, so we have a number of different combinations that you could envision, but it's very hard for us to tell you specifically by country. We typically, in many countries, we're priced above the overall average. In other countries, we're priced below and we also have different channels that we're also utilizing.", "So in our WU.com business we're actually priced quite competitively with similar kinds of products, so it really just depends on which corridors you're talking about which channels and there's a multitude of different combinations that we could be looking at. But in markets where we believe the value proposition is not aligned, then we will take the opportunity to look at that. It could be pricing changes in foreign exchange. It could be in fees, so it's hard for me to tell you a specific area where we do that.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Sometimes we increase prices in different bands, current corridors, lower bands, decrease pricing and increase on the higher bands. So it's really a very intelligent price product we have and this is based on the markets environment. We adapt the prices to the customer needs and that's what we do.", "Oscar Turner", "And then second question, you've talked a lot about expanding WU.com geographically and then also growing WU Connect. I'm just wondering how you think about possible cannibalization there or at this point, are they so small that it's not even a concern?", "Raj Agrawal", "First of all, our WU.com business is growing very, very well and it's in 34 markets, we're paying out everywhere -- almost everywhere in the world in cash and then we're delivering money into accounts into more than 50 markets. So that business continues to have a lot of good growth potential, but we also believe that much of the WU Connect opportunity is incremental in nature. It's too early to really tell you exactly how that's going to play out, but we believe that's going to be a good incremental revenue and profit opportunity for Western Union, because it's a new kind of customer. They may use us in a different way, different use cases that we have in our core business, so there's -- we just need more.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Isn't that today Raj, current customer, 80% of our customers are new to our -- they didn't use --", "Raj Agrawal", "To WesternUnion.com, yes. I mean, WesternUnion.com, we're getting more than 80% of our customers are still new to Western Union overall, so we think it's largely an incremental opportunity, but we'll see. We'll have more expense over the next several months and years.", "Jean Claude Farah", "Sure. It's the bottom of the hour so thanks everyone for joining our call and we hope you have a good day.

Overall, we delivered another solid quarter to start the year as our business continued to show resilience in the face of uneven global economic conditions. First quarter trends were generally similar to the fourth quarter. Our consumer money transfer business posted steady results. The consumer bill payments business provided good constant currency revenue growth and Business Solutions increased as well. Although the stronger dollar continued to impact reported results, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter in constant currency terms.", "In consumer money transfer, westernunion.com, U.S. outbound, and Germany continued to provide good growth, although we did see some softer business in the oil-dependent markets. Business Solutions constant currency revenue increased 6% in the quarter and consumer bill payments increased 12%.", "Operating margins were a healthy 19.9% despite increases in technology investments and negative impacts from currency. We also continue to generate strong cash flow and return over $300 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.", "So, the year is starting as expected. As we think about the next several years, as we highlighted at our Investor Day in March, our focus is on maintaining leadership in the traditional retail money transfer business, extending leadership in digital money transfer, and leveraging our cross-border platform to serve new use cases and customer segments.", "Our traditional retail business continues to deliver steady results and we are making progress on our global digital initiatives. A few digital examples this year include the launch of our mobile app for westernunion.com in Italy, which will allow Android and Apple users to access our money transfer services, a refresh mobile app in the U.K., a new mobile remittance receiving service in Bangladesh which was launched with MasterCard, bKash, and BRAC Bank, two new westernunion.com transaction sites in Europe, raising our total to 36 countries globally with online money transfer sending services.", "In Western Union Business Solutions, we introduced WU EDGE; a new service brings buyers and sellers together on one digital B2B platform where they can easily arrange and complete cross-border invoicing and payments. The platform also provides added foreign exchange and cash management tools for users.", "In addition, as we previously announced, we added the Viber social messaging app to our WU Connect platform this year. Viber has been in beta mode until last week, but we now added account payout capabilities and are excited to begin a full launch to build awareness and drive usage. We also remain focused on expanding our pay-in options and account payout network and initiating more corridor connections to bank accounts.", "I have spent a lot of time over the last several weeks travelling throughout Europe and Asia, including attending the European Money20/20 Conference in Copenhagen. These trips reinforced my belief in the importance of the end-to-end capabilities that Western Union provides in cross-border money movement and in our ability to leverage our assets for more funds-in and funds-out use cases.", "I saw an example of this in China where we work with ChinaPay to offer a fast cross-border payment for business customers in the country. We also provide many other digital services in China with Western Union money transfer available on several online and mobile banking platforms. Our collaborations in China, and all other examples I have mentioned, further convince me that our services can provide very valuable connections to partners whether they are financial institutions, social media or messaging companies, mobile operators or more traditional retailers.", "So, we see many opportunities, and I believe we have the right strategies to address them. Thus far in 2016, our business performance has been solid, and we are on track with our full year expectations while we continue to make progress on our long-term strategies.", "Now to discuss the first quarter results in more detail, I would like to turn the call over to Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Hikmet. Overall, we are pleased with the first quarter results. First quarter revenues of $1.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, while reported revenues declined 2% due to the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $57 million compared to the prior-year period. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, constant currency revenues increased 1% in the quarter, and reported revenues declined 2%, while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was driven by westernunion.com and continued strength in U.S. outbound particularly to Mexico and Latin America.", "Total C2C cross-border principal declined 2% compared to the prior year period or increased 1% constant currency. Principal per transaction was down 5% or down 3% in constant currency terms with the decline driven by several oil-related markets.", "The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 5 percentage points, including a negative 3% impact from currency. We continue to view the global pricing environment as very stable. The impact of net price decreases was 2% in the quarter, but this was primarily related to Argentina, where we took significant reductions on our outbound pricing in response to the economic and currency deterioration in the country and from the actions we took in our U.S. domestic money transfer business in April of last year. Outside of these two actions, our pricing impact would have been neutral in the quarter and mix was also neutral.", "Turning to the regions, as we did last year, due to the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. Also, as previously mentioned, we have made a change to our C2C regional reporting effective in the first quarter. We are now including the westernunion.com business within the regional numbers, splitting the revenue 50-50 between the send and receive regions, which is consistent with how we treat the retail business.", "The comparable quarterly numbers for 2015 can be found in our earnings release attachments, and we will also continue to report westernunion.com revenue and transaction growth rates in our supplemental information.", "In the quarter, North America revenue grew 3% or 5% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. The region benefited from strong growth in U.S. outbound to Mexico and Latin America with our Mexico business again outpacing the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico data for the first quarter. Total domestic money transfer revenue was flat in the quarter on transaction growth of 5%.", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% and was flat on a constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, Germany delivered strong growth but the positive impact was offset by continued weakness in Russia.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 1% constant currency, and transactions were down 3%. Low oil prices are affecting the region's result as many Gulf States have experienced slowdowns in investment and hiring. Main declines were from Nigeria, where the inbound business has been affected by wide divergence between market exchange rates and official rates, resulting from oil's impact on the economy. Saudi Arabia revenues increased, but trends were not as strong as previous quarters.", "In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or down 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 4%, primarily due to continued weakness in the Philippines. In addition, some received markets in Asia have been negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil-producing countries.", "Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was down 5%, but increased 1% constant currency. Transactions increased 11% in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., but this was largely offset by the pricing reductions in Argentina.", "Westernunion.com C2C revenue, which is included in the regional numbers just discussed, grew 16% in the quarter or 18% constant currency and represented 7% of total C2C revenue. Westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S. originated online transactions growing 28%.", "Mobile trend \u2013 mobile continues to be a fast-growing area for wu.com with over 55% of U.S. transactions being initiated on a mobile device in the quarter. The online business is also gaining good traction on sends to accounts through our expanding account payout network. The spread between transaction revenue growth for wu.com in the quarter was primarily due to lower principal per transaction and other mix. This was driven by the high growth in mobile transactions, which tend to have a smaller principal amount.", "As Hikmet mentioned, we now have online transactions sites in 36 countries which allow us to send to over 200 countries and territories. And we expect strong growth from wu.com as the year progresses as we expand our presence and further enhance our service offerings.", "In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue declined 1%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso drove the differential between reported and constant currency revenues. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong sales of hedging products in Europe. The consolidated operating profit margin was 19.9% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior year period. As expected, the operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses.", "Hedge gains in the quarter were similar to the prior year, with $15 million of gains in the current quarter compared to $16 million of gains in the first quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to prior year. Compliance expense was approximately 3.6% of revenue compared to 3.8% in the prior-year period, EBITDA margin of 25% in the quarter compared to 25.5% in the prior-year period, and as expected, our tax rate of 14.6% increased from 12.3% in the first quarter of last year. In combination with share repurchases, these results generated earnings per share of $0.37, down slightly from $0.39 a year ago.", "The C2C segment operating margin was 22.7% compared to 23.1% in the prior-year period. The C2C operating margin was negatively impacted by higher technology expense and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by benefits from cost savings and operational efficiencies and the timing of certain expenses. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 14.6% in the quarter compared to 18.7% in the prior-year period, with the decrease primarily due to increased technology expense.", "Business Solutions operating profit of $2 million was consistent with the prior-year period, while EBITDA margins improved from 14.6% to 15.1%. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $213 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $48 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.2 billion. Approximately 35% of the cash was held by United States entities.", "In the first quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $240 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December of 2017, was $472 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of March was 492 million shares. Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full-year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, earnings per share, and operating cash flow. We have maintained our constant currency revenue outlook at a low to mid-single digit increase, operating margin at approximately 20%, and earnings per share in a range of $1.58 to $1.70.", "The GAAP revenue is now expected to be approximately $50 million higher than our initial outlook based on the recent strengthening of several currencies against the U.S. dollar. Compared to 2015 rates, we now expect currency to have a negative impact on revenues of approximately $200 million for the full year. This equates to a GAAP revenue change of 300 basis points lower than the constant currency increase, rather than the 400 basis points in the prior outlook.", "The impact on operating profit from the increased revenue is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in hedge benefits, with hedge gains now projected at approximately $40 million compared to $50 million in the prior outlook. The new projection for total negative impact on operating profit from currency net of hedges is now approximately $90 million, a slight improvement from the approximately $100 million negative impact anticipated in our prior outlook.", "Since the impact on EPS was relatively small and we are still early in the year, we did not change our EPS outlook. As exchange rates stabilize or move during the year, we will update our outlook accordingly.", "So, to summarize, the first quarter results were solid, and we are on track for the year. Cash flow and the balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi, guys. I just saw that pricing was down 2%. It sounds like that's U.S. domestic pricing actions and also Argentina. Just thinking about going forward, what can we expect to going into quarter two and then throughout the year on the pricing actions?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Bryan. As you said, it was Argentina and we had last year, as you know, some U.S. domestic pricing; that's a little bit impact on that. But I see the pricing environment very stable. I don't see big changes here. Looking around the world, I think we have \u2013 our pricings are stable and I don't see big changes. And I'm quite confident that we're going to keep the pricing as we guided in the beginning of the year.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, if you exclude those two items, the pricing was flat in the quarter which is consistent with prior trends.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "But going forward, the Argentina pricing will impact another three quarters. U.S. domestic pricing will anniversary this upcoming quarter. Just trying to (18:17).", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Argentina will continue to be in the pricing numbers. It's just \u2013 it's related to the devaluation that took place in December. And then, DMT pricing actions that we took last year were in April. So, that will start to anniversary.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And, Raj, just incremental technology expense that weighed on the margins, is there a way to think about that how much that was in total versus the year-ago period? And kind of thinking about that going forward versus some of the offsets from some of the restructuring and cost saves. Just to think about the operating margin and some of the puts and takes there.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Yeah. The operating margin was impacted by a few things. Technology was one of them and then we had some negative foreign exchange impact, and then we have some benefits from cost savings and timing of expenses as well. The technology expense, we said, when we came into the year that we expected to spend well over $50 million incrementally on technology. And that's on a base of a few hundred million dollars. So, if you just take that in each quarter, that's roughly the impact \u2013 some of the later quarters will start to go over, if you will. But in total, for the year, we see over $50 million of incremental spend on technology.", "And then some of the cost savings, if you recall, we had \u2013 we took about $11 million of costs in the fourth quarter, and that's going to translate to a few million dollars of savings this year. And then we also are just managing the business very tightly and efficiently on the expense side, and we've also had some timing specific (19:49) expenses as well that helped us in the first quarter.", "And so, the primary negative impact was around technology, which again for the year will be well over $50 million incrementally and then some of the negative foreign exchange impact.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just last question for me, Hikmet, just looking at the C2C line, it was at 1% constant currency revenue growth. Is there anything you can do to stimulate that line to get stronger growth going forward this year, or are you going to be \u2013 it's going to be dependent upon economies and what's going on in oil that is just going to keep that languishing as a growth rate? Thanks so much.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Bryan, I think our forecast didn't change as we gave it in the beginning of the year. I see \u2013 the answer is digital, digital, digital. Westernunion.com expansion, the answer is it's growing very strong. Actually, we had 25% transaction growth. And within that, within the digital is the mobile. 55% of our transactions in the U.S. are initiated by mobile phones. It's a little bit lower principal amount, with respect to a little bit \u2013 revenue per transaction, a little bit lower. But generally, that's the direction.", "I'm also excited about the new social media partnership like Viber. Let's see where it goes. It's too early to tell that, but I believe that the digital is the \u2013 will begin growth on the C2C, and digital connection to 200 countries. Digital connection to retail locations, digital connection to our account payout network, which we are more than 1 billion accounts. That will come \u2013 growth that will accelerate over the few quarters, I believe.", "On retail money transfer, I think that that will continue to be flattish. It will continue to be slow. And \u2013 but, it's \u2013 I think the team is doing a great job there also keeping the retail money transfer very strong. In fact, recently today I just saw the Mexico numbers came out and we are winning, I saw again, market share there. So, that's the thing.", "But the global economy, the oil-producing countries like Russia, like Saudi Arabia has a little bit impact to our growth and that's \u2013 I would be cautious there. Other side, the Germany did very well. We didn't \u2013 even within the Gulf States, Europe (22:19) did well. I mean that's really differentiated country by country.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the color. I'll pass the line.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Bryan.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, guys. It looks like overall outside of the callouts you had on pricing in Argentina, et cetera, that pricing has been relatively stable in most cases in the last couple of quarters. The one thing I just noticed, though, and I want to ask about it is on the wu.com business looks like the transaction growth has held up in the mid-20%s but I think the revenue growth decelerated to more of a mid-teens growth rate. Is there anything maybe specifically that \u2013 I might \u2013 maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, that's causing that?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think first of all, as you know, Darrin, it changes quarter by quarter, the revenue growth. But the main impact there is the mix and the mobile. As I mentioned earlier, the mobile is growing very fast, mobile transactions. And within the mobile transactions, the revenue per transaction is lower than in an online transaction. So people are using really strong mobile transactions, but the revenue per transaction has an impact to the revenue. So, that's the gap part. Over \u2013 it's also quarter-by-quarter. I believe that we planned to have a strong growth here also in revenue coming over. And the other thing is also we just launched on two new countries in Europe. We are now in 36 countries. Having the sending capability to 200 countries, so that will bring also. But the differentiation \u2013 answering directly to your question is, definitely the mix here.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. So (23:57)...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And just to add, Darrin, we had 55% of our transactions here in the U.S. initiated on a mobile device and so that's driving significant transaction growth in mobile channel.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So I mean the good news generally of mobile is that it'll come with more frequent transactors, right?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "In other words, the transactor will do (24:16).", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Well, it's a new customer base too. It's largely...", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...incremental opportunity for us, and so that's good. I mean we still had 25% transaction growth...", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...and we still expect very strong growth for the rest of this year as well.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. So despite the lower revenue yield, it's actually coming with a more sticky and a better transaction growth rate is basically the way we should look at it.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And, Darrin, there are also new (24:39) cannibalizing our business as you know. There are new customers; we didn't have that.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. And I asked this a couple of times before, but it's always impressive to me to see the growth rate of the C2B business. I know that again you talked a lot about what's happening and some of the market drivers, but just give us some color again on the sustainability into that growth rate on a constant currency basis.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Again, digital, digital, digital, with Speedpay growing very fast.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Our U.S. digital business on the payments are growing really good. That drives the growth. The other one is also Argentina. The Argentina transactions have been coming very well. It's a very sticky business. People are using with their barcodes going to the locations and using our Pago F\u00e1cil payments. It's a very sticky business. People like the convenience. It's fast and biller like the convenience also because they get the money immediately. And it's a win-win situation. And that has been a good business. However, saying that, Darrin, our retail business there has been slowing as you know. Not significantly slowing, but it's been on a slower growth, negative growth over the last quarters.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. In the U.S. retail business?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "In the U.S. retail, yes.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, makes sense. Very quickly, Raj, on the tax rate, 15%, is that still a good number for the year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We said, mid-teens, Darrin. So, yeah, mid-teens is still a good number for the year. And in any given quarter, it's going to be up or down from that number. But mid-teens is a good number.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. All right, guys. Thanks very much.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Darrin.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America.", "David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Hi. This is David Chu for Sara. You mentioned...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, David.", "David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Hi. You mentioned that timing of spend helped 1Q a bit. Can you just discuss this?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, that wasn't the biggest factor. It was really related to cost savings that we had from last year's actions and then we've just been managing other efficiency opportunities within the business. We had some timing of spend, but we also had other things that, like technology spend that were higher than we would have thought in the first quarter. So, it's sort of netted out to zero. That wasn't the primary driver of the margin impact this year \u2013 this quarter.", "David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay. And then, in regards to these oil-producing countries, I mean, do you expect trends to weaken in upcoming quarters because it seems like to-date you hadn't seen a major impact in Europe \u2013 it sounds like you're calling it out now when you hadn't in previous quarters.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. You got that, David. I mean, first of all, I always called Russia out, right? Remember, Russia was also and we have some \u2013 also oil-impacted issues like in Nigeria with the currency. But Saudi Arabia, for instance, still growing, but the pace of growth has been a little \u2013 slower than in previous quarters. Within the Gulf States, though, there are still countries growing very strong and I would say that the growth comes currently from U.S. outbound from Germany, from Europe, parts of Europe and our digital business has been performing very well.", "And so it's going to continue. That's the beauty of being in 200 countries having that portfolio that we have. And just say it again, you know it anyway, but none of our countries out of the U.S. are bigger than 7% of our revenue, so which means that we have really a huge portfolio. Some of the countries which we call it out has less than 1% of the revenue. And so, it is \u2013 we see some impact, but I wouldn't say that it's major.", "David J. Chu - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Great. Actually a related question because everything else seem pretty stable or consistent. Just on the oil-dependent regions, what can you do to revive growth there? I mean, it sounds like pricing is not a tool you will use, anything else that's available to Western Union?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think \u2013 as you know, our business, sending and receiving, we just \u2013 for instance, in Russia or in Nigeria or all these countries, not only on the send countries, Tien-tsin, it's also on the receive countries we see something. We do inbound. We changed our marketing activities to inbound instead of outbound, and we really do some promotions about that, if the outbound export related oil-producing jobs get less. Besides that, obviously, it's an industry issue if there are less jobs about that, it's economical impact. But I would say that we called it out now. We see the first signs. I'm not sure if that's going to continue. It can turn around back again and I don't see a major issue but we called it out because we feel the first slowdowns. And Russia, we always called it out.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We're going to continue to benefit with low oil prices in other parts of our business, as Hikmet mentioned earlier. And we continue to get really strong growth in the U.S. Germany was very strong for us again. The U.K. did well. In our dot-com business, we continue to see very strong opportunities there. So, these other areas will be an offset to some of these other softer areas.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. All part of the portfolio. So my only follow-up, maybe for you, Raj, is just you bought back a lot of stock, it looks like this quarter, which is great. It looks, at least mathematically, just over $400 million in cash left in the U.S. So do we need to expect that the buybacks to slow or do you have some other levers to pull to keep this pace up?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, Tien-tsin, we have about $470 million left on the authorization which goes through the end of next year. So the current \u2013 we have enough capacity to be able to buy for this year and next year and we have enough sources of cash and other capacity to be able to continue to buy back our stock.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Good to know. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Tien-tsin.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Thanks, guys. How are you?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Jason. How are you?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "How are you?", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Good. Good. I just want to ask a follow-up question on wu.com because I can appreciate the mix dynamics here. I'm just thinking about sort of rest of year and constant currency revenue growth potential of the business because I noticed the year-over-year comparisons on that metric are going to get tougher the rest of the year, and it probably wouldn't be surprising if the mobile mix continues to accelerate versus the 55% levels you saw in the U.S. this quarter just given the way consumer preferences are trending.", "So, just so we've got the expectations teed up properly, I mean, this 18%-ish number we saw in Q1, is that a decent run rate or are we going to see some natural slump in the rest of the year because of the tougher comps and because of some potential acceleration of the mix shift to mobile within the wu.com channel?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Jason, you know me. It's more, more, more is better. Obviously, we want to grow faster. I think our plans are we want to grow revenue, accelerate the revenue growth, and we are working on that. Especially also, the expansion on the new global \u2013 new geographies will help that also because these are just starting the new geographies. Once the customer gets sticky, they started to get revenue also there, right?", "And I believe that our plans are built on stronger growth definitely here also. And the mix is definitely something that the customer behavior is changing. But I believe also that we just launched in Italy a new mobile app. We have also in U.K., we upgraded our mobile app there. People are using more mobile, and they are more sticky and we are responding to the customer needs, and I think that will grow stronger.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then can you quantify on average how much lower the principal per transaction is on the mobile wu.com transactions versus the non-mobile?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I can't really \u2013 I mean I can try to quantify it for you, but it's not \u2013 I mean it's a little bit of a difference. I don't think we have the real data behind that, but it's enough to make a difference because of the significant growth that we are getting on mobile.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Right.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's probably $20, $30 difference, so it doesn't make a big difference on each transaction. But when you have such strong growth on each transaction, that's where it's making a difference on the overall picture. And I would just say that as we add new features, as we add new geographies, more channels, more bank funding, and more bank payout, all of these things are going to layer in more growth opportunity for us as we move forward.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And just last one for me, I know that FX volatility can have some impacts in your business, and FX vol was peaking last year; it's going to start to probably anniversary some of those peak-ish levels. I mean is that essentially what you've baked into the outlook for the year? Or how should we be thinking about that dynamic?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Yeah. Just \u2013 Jason, just on the actual difference in principal, it looks like it's about a $100 difference in principal. I was just trying to remember from memory between mobile and the web channel, just...", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...so you have that. And then, on the foreign exchange volatility, it doesn't really have a big impact to the overall business. It may have some impact in our B2B business in the short-term. And we \u2013 whatever we're seeing right now, we've generally tried to take into account in our outlook for the year.", "Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. Thank you, guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj. How are you?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hello, Ashwin. How are you?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good. How are you, Ashwin?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "I'm good. Thanks. A question on wu.com, is it possible to break that out in terms of how much of the growth is from adding new countries versus sort of a same-store type of growth where you already are? And also, from a geographical perspective, is it safe to say that the North America piece primarily benefited, given the same 50/50 principal that you used in terms of splitting out revenue contribution?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Ashwin, on your 50/50 question, I mean, are you asking why we did it or how does it fit into the (35:56)?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "You always do it, but that would imply that if more of your \u2013 I guess the question I'm asking is from a geographical perspective...", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "... (36:03) America-centric from an outbound perspective.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me give a shot on that \u2013 try to answer your question. Raj, feel free to jump in. But on the \u2013 most of the transaction \u2013 on the first part of your question, most of the transactions are generated in the countries where we've been longer, obviously, like the U.S., U.K., like the countries we've been \u2013 like Germany, we've been longer with our online services.", "And the new countries, it takes a while to \u2013 when they come to at the portfolio. And it's a promotion part \u2013 it's the customer (36:38). So, most of the part \u2013 the majority of the transactions are definitely from the countries where we have been. And it's good also because it's more \u2013 we see also one phenomenon on the digital is that the customers use more often our services when they use online, when they want to register. They stay there and they use it. So, that's great news.", "The second part of the question is on the 50/50. It's basically the combining our efforts, marketing efforts and our branding efforts, our go-to market efforts together with the regions. As you know, we were very much focused with the digital. Do we have a good start-up with our $300 million revenue approximately a year? We are, I believe, the market leader in the digital pace and we are growing strong here.", "And now, it's time to really \u2013 expanding that faster globally using our agent network. Within the agent network also, we are promoting our westernunion.com and combining our agent activities, regulatory activities in the regions with our dot-com digital business. That's the positive side. That's why we are putting that also on the region.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Understood. Sort of a follow-up on the tech expense. Raj, was your comment that tech expense got pulled forward. Was that what you're saying and the rest of the year is going to be a lower level or were you saying basically that you decided to now spend more on technology?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, I \u2013 let me just restate. We're going to spend an incremental amount of money this year well over $50 million. The timing of that will vary by quarter as some of the spending started to ramp late last year. So, we may start to grow over some of that towards the end of the year. But that's really what I was trying to say.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And the incremental spending, I mean in the past, Raj, you had mentioned obviously investing in the core platform, investing in big data. What is this incremental investing for? Is it more \u2013 I mean I saw that you guys did a block-chain investment, but that seems more like a financing type of thing, but (39:04).", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The block-chain investment is a nominal investment. We make investments like that from time-to-time just to stay close to things that are happening in that space. But the technology spend, the incremental spend is really upgrading our legacy platforms, our settlement system, our data centers, and our core processing capability. And so, it upgrades those systems. It allows us to be more nimble in the market. It also allows us to be better fit to serve digital partners as we add them. And some of these are multi-year programs, right, so they're not going to be done in a one-year period. They're going to continue on for a couple of years. And so, that's really where the spending is geared towards.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. When you say multi-year, can you put a timeframe? I mean is it, say, middle of next year or...?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. It's just multi-year in nature. I mean some of these programs will go away at the end of next year or sometime next year. Others will continue on for a couple more years, so it's hard to say exactly when they're going to fall off. And we're going to continue to invest in our digital area too. So as we add new digital partners, we may launch new upgrades or new programs in that regard, so I don't see us fall off in spending in the technology side anytime soon.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think, Raj \u2013 Ashwin, sorry \u2013 as you know that parts of that really finding efficiency for existing IT, parts of that is really investing in the new part on the digital environment and on really the WU Connect or also connecting the banks. If I connect part of the banks to our system and we see \u2013 as I was recently in China, really the ChinaPay connection to us needs some investment and examples like ChinaPay or examples like big banks connecting our systems (41:07) like Viber, social media connecting the system needs some upgrade and required some investment. That's the part of it, the innovation part of it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Understood. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, Hikmet and Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "(41:31).", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Now that you have another quarter under your belt, can you give an update on how WU Connect partnerships are tracking versus your initial expectations? And at this point, do you have a better sense for how many of those transactions are incremental?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think it's too early to call, Danyal. It's still very small. But I'm very excited actually about the Viber. We just finished the beta test. The results are very good. Actually, the beta mode was last week and so we went to full market launch. Let's see how that works. It's too early to call from revenue and transaction side, but I'm excited about that. The other thing is also what I'm excited also we have some other partners in the pipeline. We are developing \u2013 that's a part of \u2013 as Ashwin asked the question earlier, that's a part of our also investments in the technology to be ready for the new partners also and maybe additional focus on that is required. So I'm not going to share with you the transaction numbers because it's too early to call. It's new use cases. But we'll see and hopefully when it comes, I can report then better news, good news here about our partners.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Understood. And the Treasury departments then pretty active in clamping down on inversion, Raj, but do any of their actions have implications for your working capital strategy potentially in the future?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "They should not. And these are not rules yet anyway. They're probably going to go through a lot of evolution before anything actually comes to market, but even in its current form, it should not have any impact to our working capital strategies or tax rate or what's been discussed recently.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hi. Good evening.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey. How are you?", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good. Maybe, Raj, I wanted to ask you about the Business Solutions segment and maybe what type of revenue growth you think we need to \u2013 you need to see there to really start seeing improvement in the operating margin?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, as you saw that, we had some improvement in our margin side, but on the revenue side, we definitely want to see better revenue here. 6% we had \u2013 despite the global trade issues, despite the global economic issues, despite the currency volatility like in U.K. against other currencies, we did have a 6% growth in revenue terms. And I think that the global trade will help us once it gets picked up, new customers. But the other thing is also, our market share is quite low here, and we see an opportunity here to grow that on our market share. So, it is \u2013 definitely, growth will help to expand the margins, but the team is doing a good job. We even saw this quarter a margin expansion. Right, Raj?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean margins were up a little bit, 15.1% EBITDA margin versus 14.6% in the prior-year quarter. And then last year, Kartik, we improved margins to around 15% again on an EBITDA basis and that was higher than the 11% that we had in the prior year. So, revenue growth really is the key for us to be able to drive better profitability there. That business has relatively larger proportion of fixed costs than the rest of our company. But it's heading in the right direction at least from a margin standpoint.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And then just what pressures, if any, are you seeing from the other online money transfer companies that are out there, either from a pricing standpoint or any other competitive pressures that you might be witnessing from them?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, nothing different than the retail competitors, I would say. As you recall, Kartik, at our Investor Day, we had a chart representing the branded money transfer companies, digital companies, what our market share is, what we believe that their revenue is. So, I believe that given our fundamentals, given our global reach, we do have a quite good expansion. We are growing very fast. We are winning market share here. So, comparing with that, I think also there's still growth opportunities that we can capture growth opportunities with new customer segments, but also on the financial institutions. More and more financial institutions are looking at us, saying that can you process the transaction from the U.S. to Vietnam or from Germany to Peru? And all these things with our compliance programs, with our platforms, we can expand our opportunities here. So, I think we are gaining market share in the digital environment.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Kartik.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I appreciate it. A couple of actually housekeeping questions, I guess. One is on the cost of goods this quarter, I saw it was up as a percent of revenue year-on-year. You're obviously doing a nice job on SG&A. I just wonder if you could give a little color on sort of gross margin trends.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, on cost of goods, specifically, the two things that impacted \u2013 the reason why it's higher is that it's largely related to technology expense increase in the quarter, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange. And then we had some offsets from cost savings. But those are the primary drivers there. Commission rates were relatively flat year-over-year in the quarter, and that continues to be the case and in line with our expectations. So it was really driven by these other factors.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. So, over time, you should see some gross margin expansion?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we'll be at around 20% overall margins this year, and that's still consistent with our outlook.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And with regard to cash flow from operations, noticed it was kind of flattish year-on-year, maybe some growth in other assets or working cap. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what's going on there?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, it's just a result of \u2013 I mean, we have lower net income, but then we have some positives in net working capital side. So, we're relatively flat overall. So, nothing special there going on in operating cash flow.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And would expect those trends to just sort of normalize as the year goes on.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mean, our outlook for cash flow \u2013 operating cash flow is around $1 billion, so it should follow a similar kind of pattern that we've had historically. So there's nothing really special there to call out.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then one last one, I know account-to-account is a pretty important growth thrust for Western Union. And I heard you mentioned it, Hikmet, can you talk a little bit about on how we might see account-to-account really kind of play out as a potential long-term revenue driver.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think there is opportunity. The reason I'm mentioning is that more financial institutions are also start to use our platform because of offering their customers capability on compliance, on technology, on settlement, on multi-currency payout.", "So, walk in a small financial institution somewhere in the U.S. saying that I want to send money to Nigeria, we can able that, right. I mean, it's hard for them \u2013 others. So, they are using us as partners. And that goes \u2013 that starts to be more not only on the retail side being cash-in, start to be account-to-account. So, the funds in, coming from an account then going to an account somewhere in the world. Recently, we are seeing very strong growth in India. Westernunion.com transactions \u2013 billed transactions through an account is growing very well.", "Or \u2013 and a recent example, there is very \u2013 you know it is our bKash model, and it's kind of mobile wallet in Bangladesh, which you can send, it's like you can see that there's an account where you can send money to a bKash account mobile wallet. That was a cooperation between BRAC Bank, MasterCard, and us, bKash together. So, I see there are growth opportunities for us to grow that. And our goal is \u2013 we have more than 1 billion accounts now globally; our goal is expanding that \u2013 also reaching out to new customers and being more in more countries with our account network.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Would you anticipate that we could think about that perhaps moving the needle at some point for Western Union in the back half of 2016 or 2017 or did it have a longer tail on it?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's early to call it. Probably, I'll give \u2013 I can give you more color next year about that. But I would say that I see it as a growth opportunity and I will leave it here for now because it's too early to give you a direction here.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research.", "Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP", "Good afternoon, guys. I was hoping you could just help us think about the C2C transaction growth rate, broadly speaking, particularly in the quarter considering the extra day benefit or probably what is roughly a percentage point from leap year and just how you guys think about that metric going forward for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Matt. The transaction growth was 3%, which is consistent with the fourth quarter. The leap year probably helped us a little bit but we also had a negative impact from the Easter holiday which fell into the first quarter this year versus second quarter last year. So, there's probably some offset to that and that doesn't change our overall outlook for the year. We haven't given a transaction growth outlook for the year but our revenue growth is low to mid-single-digits. And it's just reflective of the things that we're seeing around the world. We have some pockets of strengths and some of pockets of weakness. And some of the differential that you saw between revenue growth and transaction growth in the first quarter was related to Argentina, where the transaction growth continued but revenue growth fell off a little bit. So, that's really what we're seeing.", "Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And then the next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI", "Good evening. Do you intend to bid for a Walmart cross-border contract now that Walmart has gone non-inclusive with MoneyGram?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, as you can imagine, I won't give any details on our negotiations or any potential partners or any market environment. Look, we've been doing that for years. We're going to expand our capabilities to get any partners within our terms, which has to be \u2013 fit in, in our strategy, which has to serve our customers. It could be Walmart, it could be someone else, but it has to fit in with our business strategy and within our guidance. That would be my answer.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Got it. And one last follow-up. When will the board next meet to discuss an update to your dividend policy and what do you expect the board to decide?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, our board meets on a regular basis and I won't call out exactly when they discuss specific topics. But as you know, dividend payout for us is a key, important part of our overall capital return, Rayna. We're paying a \u2013 we have a payout ratio of in the high-30% range. We are paying back almost \u2013 or more than $300 million a year in dividends. So, it's going to continue to be a key important part of our overall capital return strategy.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore ISI", "Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Rayna.", "Operator", "And next, we have David Scharf from JMP.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, David.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Hey, first, I might have missed it, Raj, but I believe you made reference to a little bit of a benefit from expense timing in the quarter. What did that refer to, and should we expect that to show up in the second quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, there is always going to be expense timing from year-to-year versus what we had planned for, so you'll see it sometime during this year. But our outlook for margins are around 20% and that has not changed for the full-year. So, there is some variability in timing of certain expenses and that's all I was referring to.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Okay. It was nothing specific. Got it. Secondly, can you just remind me, of the roughly $1 billion of cash from ops, maybe around $830 million, $850 million of free cash flow, how much is generated in the U.S. in that forecast?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we generally have about 25% of our cash flow available to us in the U.S. through our normal repatriation that we do and about 75% outside the U.S.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Okay. And that mix isn't expected to be any different this year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mean, it's going to vary a little bit year-to-year but that's the general mix.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. And just lastly, a bit of an open-ended question that will maybe put you in the spot a little, but you've obviously provided a lot of detail on your plans and the developments of wu.com mobile initiatives and the like. Just wondering, in your opinion right now as you look at the competitive landscape, what do you think is the most formidable new technology or offering out there in the industry that obviously \u2013 that Western Union doesn't own?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mobile, mobile, mobile, right? I mean the use case \u2013 the customers tell us that they want to use their mobile while they walk to an underground and send money to Mexico, or while they are sitting in a meeting they want to use their iPad and send money to England. So that's what we have to upgrade our mobile applications on their Android or on their Apple devices. I think that's something \u2013 and I believe that we are really seeing \u2013 looking at the numbers and comparing it with the competition and comparing with our prices, we are really leading the industry here.", "And the team in San Francisco and my team is doing a good job. There will be always a competition on the \u2013 technical competition on the corridor by corridor. I recently was in Copenhagen at Money20/20. There are a lot of FinTech companies coming with ideas, but nobody can really offer the end-to-end solution. No one of them can say that, okay, you can send money from 36 countries on many mobile apps to 200 countries and pick up the money in minutes and do the compliance and pay out in 131 currencies and to a good price. So that's definitely the technology. We are looking at it. That's definitely the way we are investing. That's definitely the way we are upgrading our technologies.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. It doesn't sound like any particular vendor out there springs to mind in terms of...", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't see it. I don't see it. I just was \u2013 I did, again, a market tour with my team, I don't see it yet there something. So we are \u2013 so it's not only the technology only, it's also the end-to-end process. As I said, it's the regulatory environment. It's a complex business. It's being a global, having the brands, all these things got together and packaging in a way that customer feels simple from sending money from a mobile phone to 200 countries.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Laura, we'll take one more question?", "Operator", "All right.

Could you discuss the trend you expect for the rest of the year? It looks like Q1 was strong driven by Mexico and Latin America. Could you expect similar outbound trends to continue?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "All right. North America, we've seen \u2013 I mean, this has continued from last year, we've seen good trends to Mexico and to Latin America. And then the DMT business, we saw a flat revenue growth. The North American business by all indications should continue to perform well. I can't give you a specific number, but we continue to see good growth in the North American market at least for this year.", "Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.", "Sounds good.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Laura. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2016 second quarter results, and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2015 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We've reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section.", "All statements made by Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results and with the resilience of our business. Revenue increased 3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with the last several quarters, despite the challenging global market environment.", "Our consumer money transfer business was once again led by strong performance from westernunion.com, which delivered 20% constant currency revenue growth. Regionally, the money transfer business was aided by continued strong results from the U.S.", "The international picture was more mixed, with growth in some key European countries but continued challenges from many oil industry dependent markets. In addition to consumer money transfer, our business solutions and consumer bill payments businesses each delivered solid constant currency results.", "Overall, we continued to invest heavily in our technology infrastructure and currency remains a negative, but despite these factors, we generated solid profitability in the quarter. We also returned over $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which means in total we returned $475 million in the first half of the year.", "Before discussing our strategic progress, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the global geopolitical environment, including Brexit implications for Europe. As you know, the world has experienced significant geopolitical turbulence in recent months, in addition to what we have seen the last couple of years.", "Terrorist attacks in many countries, the attempted coup in Turkey, elections focused on immigration, currency volatility and many other such events have created headlines just over the last few weeks. There's a long list of countries dealing with major issues across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere.", "Despite the uncertainties surrounding these events, our business has remained stable, thanks to our global reach and diversified portfolio of countries, as well as resilience of our consumer base.", "While these types of events will likely have more impact in the coming years, we will continue to adjust our resources appropriately and work through the challenges to provide our needed services around the world.", "As for Brexit, U.K. is an important market for both business solutions and our consumer money transfer business and the country represented almost 7% of total company revenues last year.", "In the short term, we saw reduced trading activities from our Business Solution customers in the U.K. in the weeks leading up to Brexit vote, but a heavy increase in the last week of the quarter following the decision.", "Overall in the quarter, we saw good growth in the U.K. B2B business and the C2C business increased as well in constant currency terms. Longer term, the impact of Brexit is still uncertain as we like others must wait for the U.K. and the European Union to negotiate the exit agreements. However, in the near-term we do not expect Brexit to cause significant disruption to our businesses or operations in the U.K. or Europe.", "Turning now to our strategic initiatives: we continue to make progress on several fronts. With westernunion.com, mobile continues to lead the way in the U.S. with nearly 60% of the countries westernunion.com transactions initiated on mobile in the quarter. Internationally, we introduced upgraded mobile transaction apps for westernunion.com in eight markets. Overall, we now have online transaction sites in 37 countries, with mobile apps in 11 of these. Additionally, similar to what we have done with Viber and WeChat in the U.S., we just added our money transfer services to the Yandex.Money mobile app in Russia. So Yandex consumers can now initiate the transfers on their phones to Western Union locations around the world.", "As I have mentioned in the past, one of our key growth initiatives for the future is to capture some of the cross-border business being delivered into accounts around the world and we continue to build out our network. Currently, we have the capability to deliver funds into billions of accounts in over 50 countries.", "On the retail side, we recently signed several key agent agreements including a renewal with Rite Aid in the U.S. and the new agreement with Walmart de M\u00e9xico. And in Western Union Business Solutions, we have activated over 6,000 business clients on our new integrated digital platform, WU EDGE, and we'll continue to roll out enhancements and build the importer and exporter network.", "Finally, I would like to mention the recent announcement that we have successfully completed the primary recommendation for our Southwest border settlement agreement. Our teams have worked very hard over the last several years to reach this stage and the actions taken have contributed to an overall strengthening of our compliance programs. While compliance enhancements are a part of our business model and a long-term competitive advantage, we are pleased to be able to complete this important milestone for the company.", "So to recap, we have continued to produce solid results and are on-track to deliver our business outlook for 2016. We are making good progress on our strategies and have made strong advances in our compliance programs.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results in more detail.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 1%, or increased 3% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $49 million, compared to the prior year period.", "In the Consumer to Consumer segment reported revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 3%. C2C constant currency revenue growth was again led by westernunion.com, with regional growth led by North America and Latin America.", "Total C2C cross-border principal declined 1% compared to the prior year period and was flat on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency terms. The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 4 percentage points, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from currency.", "Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1 point in the quarter, while there was no net impact from pricing. While the previously implemented Argentina price reductions are still affecting the spread, these were largely offset by FX spread increases in other parts of the world. We continue to find the overall pricing environment to be stable and do not expect significant changes in the near future.", "Turning to the regions, consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. In the second quarter, the North America business was strong. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound growth was again driven by sends to Mexico and Latin America.", "In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the second quarter. The U.S. domestic money transfer revenue also grew in the quarter, posting a 4% increase on transaction growth of 3%.", "We have begun adjusting prices in some additional cities to the same levels we implemented in part of the country last year. Due to the very limited amount of revenue that is affected, we don't expect these changes to have a significant impact on our pricing investment this year.", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 3% or 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 3%. Similar to prior quarters, Germany delivered good growth, but this was offset by continued declines in Russia.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 4% or 3% constant currency, and transactions were down 5%. Low oil prices continue to affect the region's results, with Nigeria and Libya the main drivers of the revenue decline in the quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 3% or 1% constant currency. Transactions decreased 3% as received markets in the region, including India continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittance system in oil-producing countries.", "Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region was flat, but increased 6% constant currency on transaction growth of 12%. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strong inbound business from the U.S., while the spread between revenue and transaction growth was caused by the price reductions and currency depreciation in Argentina.", "westernunion.com C2C revenue which is included in the regional numbers just discussed grew 19% in the quarter, or 20% constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. westernunion.com transactions increased 25% with U.S. originated online transactions growing 27%.", "In the Consumer-to-Business segment revenue declined 2%, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. The depreciation of the Argentine peso caused the decline in the reported revenues, constant currency revenue growth was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions reported revenues increased 3% or 6% on a constant currency basis aided by strong growth from Europe.", "Turning to margins and profitability: we did incur a $15 million accrual in the quarter, or $10 million after-tax for a legal matter. This relates to a Federal Trade Commission matter regarding our consumer protection and anti-fraud programs, as noted in our 10-Qs. The matter is still pending and the final resolution is still uncertain, so we will not be able to provide additional details at this time.", "Including this accrual, the consolidated operating profit margin was 18.9% in the quarter, compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of last year, or 20.7% excluding the impact of the Paymap settlement in the prior year period. The FTC accrual negatively impacted the current quarter's margin by 110 basis points. Other factors affecting the margin included incremental technology expense, and the negative impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions in compensation related costs and other expenses.", "Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $11 million, compared to $20 million of gains in the second quarter of 2015. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $23 million in the quarter, compared to prior year.", "Compliance expense was approximately 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year period. EBITDA margin of 23.7% in the quarter, compared to 22.7% in the prior year period, or 25.2% excluding the Paymap settlement.", "Our tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter, compared to 8.5% in the second quarter of last year, or 11.8% excluding the settlement charge. The tax rate in the current quarter benefited from changes in tax contingency reserves and other discrete items, including the impact of the FTC accrual which lowered the rate by approximately 180 basis points. Including all of these items, and some additional benefits expected in the second half of the year, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 12%.", "Earnings per share of $0.42 in the quarter, compared to $0.36 in the prior year, or $0.41 excluding the Paymap charge. The FTC accrual negatively affected the current quarter's earnings by $0.02 per share. The C2C segment operating margin was 21.5%, compared to 23.3% in the prior year, and was affected by 130 basis points by the accrual.", "Similar to the company overall, other factors affecting the C2C margin included higher technology expense and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reductions in compensation related costs and other expenses. The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter, compared to 18.3% excluding the Paymap settlement charge in the prior year period.", "The margin decline compared to the adjusted margin a year ago was primarily due to increased technology expense and customer mix. Business Solutions improved operating profit to $5 million, or a 5% margin from breakeven in the prior year period. Business Solutions EBITDA margin increased to 18.1% from 12.1%.", "The operating profit improvement was driven by increased revenues and reductions in compensation related expenses. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter, compared to $12 million in the prior year.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet: cash flow from operating activities was $486 million year-to-date through June. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had $3.2 billion of debt and cash of $1.2 billion.", "Approximately 30% of the cash was held by United States entities. During the second quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for total of $78 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $394 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at end of June was 488 million shares.", "Based on the first half results and recent business trends, we are affirming our full year financial outlooks for constant currency revenue growth, operating profit margin, and operating cash flow. The GAAP revenue outlook has been decreased slightly to reflect changes in several key foreign currencies including the Euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar and we now expect the GAAP revenue change to be about 400 basis points lower than the constant currency increase.", "The impact on operating profit from the currency adjustments is largely expected to be offset by hedge benefits with hedge gains currently projected at approximately $45 million, compared to approximately $40 million in the prior outlook.", "Also as mentioned earlier, we now expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 12%, which is down from the mid-teens expectation in the prior outlook as we are benefiting from several favorable outcomes relative to our reserves and discrete items.", "We have also included the impact of the $15 million FTC accrual in our outlook although we still expect operating margins of approximately 20%. As a result of all these factors, the earnings per share outlook has been narrowed to a range of $1.60 to $1.70, up from the prior range of $1.58 to $1.70.", "So, to summarize, we are pleased with the second quarter results, which came in largely as expected and our full year earnings outlook has been narrowed, primarily to reflect the lower tax rate and the legal matter accrual.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Tien-Tsin.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hello, Tien-Tsin.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for all the slides and the details. Just a couple questions. The digital piece, it looks like, accelerated a little bit here despite the macro. I think MoneyGram saw some decel there. What's driving that acceleration within the digital piece? Is it more distribution or are you seeing more effectiveness with your marketing?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's both, but mainly our strong growth comes from the U.S. and 60% of the transactions done in the U.S., westernunion.com are mobile transactions, U.S. outbound and U.S. intra was very good. But also the global expansion, Europe, we see also very strong growth on mobile and on the westernunion.com.", "Currently, we do have about 11 countries grew mobile apps and as you recall, Tien-Tsin, we opened also an office in Singapore to expand our success, which Khalid and the team did in Singapore, sorry, in San Francisco, the same success, we want to do that also in Singapore, expanding globally and that has been paying off. So the growth has been very strong.", "So \u2013 also I would say also the customer's staying loyal there. Once they are \u2013 they are still new customers, still we don't see cannibalization, 80% of the transactions looks like are new and the pricing has been \u2013 we did some pricing action but some pricing has been stable also. And I think we have the right strategy, Tien-Tsin.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. No, that's great. It sounds like it. Let me ask as my follow-up to both of you just on the revenue guidance. You're keeping it constant. It looks like you're running 2% to 3% FX-neutral revenue growth first half of the year. You're still guiding low to mid-single digits. Given what you called out in terms of the macro and the tax, what-not, is it more likely we'll see it at the lower end of that, or is there still potential for it to accelerate into the mid-single digits given what you see?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. I would just say that we've given a range of possible outcomes. There's still potential for it to change. There are some components of our business that are accelerating. You saw digital accelerate in the second quarter. We have high growth expectations there. We have some other areas that are accelerating as well. But we're also cautious with some of the challenges that we see in other parts of the world.", "So we'll see what happens in some of the oil-related markets like Saudi Arabia or Nigeria and Libya, and we're watching those very closely. So those will certainly have an impact and that will have an impact on the overall outcome in the end.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're overall confident with our outlook.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you give us an update on how your conversations on WU Connect are going, conversations with prospective social media companies, and the potential for new signings in the near term?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, good question, Sara. Hi. Viber and WeChat is still on. We have the U.S. agreements there. We just signed Yandex in Russia, which is also same like a mobile operator and a social media company, consumer do use Yandex and they can send also money from their mobile phones worldwide to 200 countries.", "The other ones are \u2013 obviously we are not making a comment for the ongoing negotiations, but we are still in a testing phase. It's not material yet, right, Sara, but we are still learning. We started recently a few weeks ago with some of the marketing activities with Viber and WeChat. I think we can give you more color about how their customers are reacting in end of Q3, maybe end of Q4. It takes time, but we are still very excited and we are still also in contact with other social media companies.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. And then just a quick cost question \u2013 could you talk about the incremental tech spending, how that's been trending, if we're at a full $50 million (22:50) annualized run rate exiting the quarter? And do you get any benefit from having now successfully completed the recommendations made by the monitor?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Sara, this is Raj. The technology spend, I would say, continues to ramp and this year we'll be spending well over $50 million incremental to last year. In any given quarter it's going to be dependent on which activities we actually have going on in the technology area. But I would say we're seeing a good level of technology spend in the second quarter and we're continuing to ramp there.", "From a Southwest border standpoint, we've been \u2013 our spending there has been coming down for the last couple of years as we've been putting some of these programs in place, and that's related to the primary recommendations, but we've also got secondary recommendations that we're putting in place where some spending will continue. And then obviously we have a global compliance program where we're spending in various parts of the world for various kinds of activities, so Southwest border was only a small piece of that.", "Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Bryan.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan. A question on the third quarter. When I look at the comps, the comps get easier in Europe and APAC. And you also talked about increased B2B transaction post the Brexit. So, as we think about the third quarter -- and I understand you don't give quarterly guidance \u2013 but should we just think about the comps being slightly easier, which helps you on the transaction side?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Ashish, as you said, we don't give a quarterly outlook, but the U.K. activity and Brexit, we saw strong activity in the last week, but eventually things will level out there. So it remains to be seen on how much heightened activity will continue, but we're watching that closely, obviously.", "You have a lot of things that are going on around the world, a lot of different activities. We've continued to see good growth in our U.S. business. The European business, we've gotten good growth from Germany in the quarter, but that's been offset by challenges in other parts of the European business like Russia, given the situation there. So there are continued challenges in various parts of the world as well as in Europe that we're continuing to monitor.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe a question on Brexit. Just as we think about the longer term \u2013 and I understand it still all needs to be formalized \u2013 but what are the different areas we should think about in terms of the impact? Could there be any impact from a regulatory perspective, technology upgrades and the investment that's required, or any impact to the volumes as you think about it, like just longer-term impact from Brexit.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's hard to tell what the negotiations between European Union and the U.K. will be. I think I'm in the same boat with other CEOs, which are active in this area. However, I would say that as it is today it's really European Union and U.K. agrees on a separation agreement, it affects like licenses, passports, which you can use in different countries, European Union passports. Also immigration policies, it may have an impact on that.", "So, we don't know. It's really early to say. We don't see any near-term impact on our business. We are pleased with our European \u2013 U.K. business. Just to put in perspective also including Western Union Business Solutions and the C2C business, consumer business, our revenue \u2013 it's about 7% of our company total revenue.", "So the beauty of Western Union is how diverse we are, how big portfolio we have, and we can always organize our portfolio. But it's hard to tell. It's too early and I would say that it's not \u2013 we can't tell it from today. We have to wait and see.", "Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks for the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, guys.", "Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hey, Darrin.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. It's good to see the results show no pricing impact on your revenue this quarter. I just want to get a quick update on your outlook around pricing, what you're really seeing from a competitive landscape, given it seems a little more stable than it's been in years past. And then the mix issue you called out that had the pressure, the 1 point or so of pressure versus transaction growth, was that just the online or the mobile mix or something? Can you give us a little more color? Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me give general market overview, maybe Raj, can give more detail to Darrin about that. Darrin, if you look at the environment, I think the pricing environment's quite stable. That doesn't mean that we are not doing pricing actions.", "As you know, we are operating 16,000 corridors and we have different areas so we do pricing actions, but overall I would say that pricing is very stable. In some quarters, we even increase prices, in some quarters we decrease. We really react to our business intelligence and market environment, and we adopt the prices generally. I would say that I don't see any big pricing pressure near-term and we are confident with our programs, marketing programs and market environment.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and just on the second quarter specifically, Darrin, the pricing investment was flat for the quarter. We've had continued impact from the Argentina reductions, price reductions we took earlier in the year. That's continuing to show up in the second quarter. But we also grew over the DMT pricing that we did in April of last year. So we're getting some benefit from that. And then we did have some spread increases in certain parts of our business overall. And then on your mix question, that's just related to mix changes in our business around the world as certain parts of the business grow faster than others. So that has a mix impact on the overall growth.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the margin side. The C2B margin was down a little more than we expected. I think you had mentioned technology investments and mix there, as well. Can you give us some sense or any more color on what we should expect there, what actually happened there and what we should expect going forward?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, on the B2B margins, the primary impact as I mentioned, was from technology, we're making technology investments throughout the company, as well as in the electronic business part of the C2B business, so that's what's impacting it. We also had some customer mix where we did have some success in signing new accounts, but they came at a slightly lower margin. But again, the biggest impact was from the technology.", "We don't want the margins to be down at this level. We expect the margins to be better overtime, but it is going to take us some time to get through some of the spending that we're doing here, on the technology side. Ultimately the goal is to drive a better platform and have better opportunities on growth in this business. So we're pleased with the overall growth, but we want to drive more growth in this business.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Is that of decline \u2013 that's embedded in your outlook for margins anyway, though, right?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It is embedded in our outlook for the year, yes, in our outlook.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sounds good. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Darrin.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, guys, this is Ryan Cary for Jason. I know you called out weakness in the petro-linked economies. And I think you said that Saudi Arabia, which had managed to avoid much of the slowdown, has also been starting to slow. Any update you can provide on your expectations for these regions would be appreciated. And then maybe remind us what percent of C2C revs comes from the primary corridors impacted by lower oil prices?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So good question. Generally the main impact on our business maybe on the weakness of the oil related countries were Libya and Nigeria. Saudi Arabia had a little bit slower, but it was not the major impact. The major impact was Libya and Nigeria and that's because of their oil-producing and oil-related economies. In general, OPEC countries, if you take the OPEC countries, it's about 10% to 15% of our revenues. So that puts also in perspective.", "Some of the \u2013 we still see good growth in UAE. We still see good growth in some parts of the businesses. But some parts of the business I have to be cautious also because like Saudi Arabia, where some investments have been slowed down, some construction, some hotels, some big airports have been slowed down and that impacted definitely the workforce there respective to the remittance market. And that slowed down. We could see it. And once the oil prices are getting more stable I'm sure that that's going to go back again. But currently we do see a little bit impact from that area.", "Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, great. And how should we be thinking about compliance trends going forward? It seems like this has remained relatively consistent at the lower end of the 3.5% to 4% range. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And then anything you see on the horizon that could cause results to trend either above or below that range?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Generally, I would say that we see compliance as a part of our business, right, business as usual. And we see it also long-term competitive advantage. One example is the Southwest border primary agreement that we completed and we definitely upgraded our compliance programs and in many countries we also see that Western Union is a preferred partner because of the compliance programs we put in place.", "I think the investment will continue. I don't see bigger changes. We operate in 200 countries and regulatory environment constantly changing and the team is doing a great job investing in the technology, but also in the people to extend our licenses.", "But also you know, it's remainder in the country being active and being a competitive advantage and protect our consumers. That's our main goal. And since the last few years we increasingly invested in the compliance environment, $200 plus million every year and that probably is really also protecting our consumers.", "Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Michael Alan Salop - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sure.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. So I guess Raj, you've given some of this information in the course of the call, but I just want to clarify. As I look at the next 12 months, we should continue from a cost perspective to see the impact of hedge rolloffs with minor uptick in the second half. Tech costs continue to go up. And looking at 1010 (34:05), compensation, restructuring continued to be the offset so that you can guide up on margins.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mean, our outlook for margins this year, Ashwin, is 20% and that's really based on everything that we know at this stage.", "Clearly, we'll have some more hedge gains in the second part of this year and some of the hedge gains will continue into next year as well. But there are a number of other factors that are going to drive margins and profitability.", "Hedges are just one component. You have cost savings as well. But commissions and compliance costs have been relatively stable. That should be \u2013 that's stable for this year and we've been able to stabilize those in the last couple of years, so that's positive. But we don't really have an outlook for next year if that's what you're getting at, Ashwin, but we feel good about the outlook for this year.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "However, we are very much focused, Ashwin, on revenue growth and profit growth, profitable growth and revenue growth, that's our focus.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, obviously revenue growth also helps the cause. My next question for you, with regards to digital mobile becoming such a big part of how people access the network and the system, is there any change in how you think of your agent network with regards to the kind of deals you can structure with them with regards to their compensation, and so on and so forth? Any update there would help?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Ashwin, currently not. I think that our agent commissions has been favorable for Western Union over the years as you know, and definitely the new agreements we sign has not been signing at the \u2013 the rates we've signed years ago. Obviously, that helped also.", "However, I would like to keep and grow my agent network because one of the biggest things we see is that the new customers, which we signed with mobile, want to drop money on a retail money transfer \u2013 retail locations worldwide, right. We do have, for instance, in India more than 100,000 locations. And you can send money immediately from Denver, from your mobile phone immediately to 100,000 locations in India, plus the thousands of millions of accounts in India in a moment (36:42); nobody else can do that, that big, as we can do it. That's a big competitive advantage.", "Saying that also, we are always looking for optimization for our sales costs, for our retail costs, and I think the team is working very hard on that, and I think long-term definitely some room there to be more efficient.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very good color. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Daniel.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, Raj. I wanted to clarify the $0.01 guidance change. It seems like if before we were assuming tax to be 15% and we lower that to 12% for the year, that's $0.06, when you factor in the $0.02 from the accrual. So, I'm looking for the other $0.03. Some of that looks like it may have been FX headwinds, but I'm wondering what else is in there.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Hi, Daniel, this is Raj. Our outlook for the full year, it does take into account the tax benefit. I would say the $0.06 that you're calculating is a little bit high. Our new outlook for the tax rate is around 12% and we had given a mid-teens level. So depending on what you assume for the actual tax rate, you'll have to walk down from that.", "But I would say your estimate's a little bit high, and then we have a $0.02 offset to that from the legal accrual. So that's why we moved up the low end of the range by the net $0.02 effectively. And so that's how we look at it. Nothing really has changed from our operating outlook. We still have the same revenue growth outlook, low to mid-single digits constant currency, profit margins at around 20%.", "And then our reported revenue is going to be a little bit lower than we thought in the last quarter, but most of that revenue change is going to be \u2013 the profit impact of that is going to be offset with the increased hedge gains. So we now expect about $45 million in hedge gains this year versus $40 million that we said in the last quarter. So all that is netting out to have no real operating impact. And so we've reflected the two key items, the taxes and the legal accrual.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. That makes sense. And I just wanted to clarify, so this quarter you were able to offset the Argentina pricing impact with FX spreads. I just want to understand better how sustainable that is and how those spreads \u2013 do they benefit, for example, when you have higher FX volatility, would we expect those to normalize or is this a more sustainable spread?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There are three things that are in the second quarter from a pricing investment standpoint. We are still seeing the Argentina impact as I mentioned. Secondly, we did grow over the domestic money transfer pricing that we did last year in April, so we're getting a benefit from that.", "And then third, we did raise some spreads in certain parts of the world. I would say on the spread changes, we have 16,000 quarters that we're monitoring pricing activity in and pricing levels and we try to optimize those on an ongoing basis. So I wouldn't characterize these as things that stay forever. We may increase spreads. We may reduce spreads. It really depends on what those particular markets require. So that's really the way I would look at the spread changes.", "Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Oscar Turner of SunTrust.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good afternoon.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. You talked a bit about your competitive advantage in mobile coming from allowing send to either retail locations or accounts. Can you provide any color into transaction or volume growth by payout method \u2013 so, looking at either transfers to retail accounts versus just to accounts, and how that has trended?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think one of the biggest competitive advantage is the retail and stays retail. Most of the transactions are paid out in money in minutes in retail in cash and that continues, especially international outbound ones are happening, but we do see very strong certain countries like in South Asian countries that the people do prefer also accounts and our promotions on the westernunion.com has been very successful there, that we can grow \u2013 we grew our account payouts also in some countries.", "In some countries we are just building it. We have now billions of accounts worldwide in 50 countries. That reminds me a little bit, right, how we built the retail money transfer business. Build it, they will come. And we are really building it, now the account network worldwide. Now billions of accounts and now it's all about communicating and building the corridor, making marketing and promotions. But still the most of the payouts are on the retail payouts but very strong growth in certain countries, certain corridors, and also on the account payout.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And then just looking at your account-to-account initiative, could you provide any color on account-to-account volume growth in the quarter? Also, at what point will this start influencing your revenue growth?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "When it becomes material definitely we will give you more color on that. It's in the beginning but it's a very strong growth. The big advantage here is that funding method is done by accounts. You have immediately the funds in mobile. You collect the money immediately from funds.", "We do have it in the U.S. but also very strong in Europe where we have a direct ACH transact, direct debit they call it in Europe and we collect the money immediately from an account then drop in an account worldwide on a billions, which country, more than 50 countries.", "And the other thing is that we see more banks calling us actually on that. Could you do this transaction for us because you have the technology, they tell us. You have the compliance programs which they have to build it globally. We do have it in 200 countries. So it started to be getting kind of advantage, kind of a focus, but again, we just build it billions of accounts and now we are really designing a product against this account-to-account transactions.", "Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Good evening.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Rayna.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Hi. Now that PayPal has owned Xoom for roughly a year, have you experienced any impact to your online business?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think the results really speak for themselves. You can see the great growth that we're getting in our wu.com business, 25% transaction growth, and 20% revenue growth in constant currency.", "And we have a business that's much broader than just the U.S., right. We have a business that's in 37 countries and we continue to expand those capabilities on an ongoing basis. We already deliver around the world in 200 countries and territories around the world and then our account payout capabilities are getting even stronger.", "And the unique thing about the account payout is that it's direct delivery into these accounts. It's not going through the correspondent banking system. And so even the newer players, they're playing only in the online space, online to counter account-to-account. They're not playing in the retail space, which is where we have our brand.", "So that's not the place they're coming after. And as you know, our digital business pays out mostly in a retail location today, right. But the growth opportunity for us is also paying \u2013 doing account-to-account or online-to-account and we think we're going to create a better and stronger business there than anybody else will be able to create.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "What progress have you made in offering instant ACH?", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Most of the transactions in the U.S. instant ACH is a very U.S. focused question I guess, and most of the transactions in the U.S. are still done by credit cards and the people prefer credit cards. We have it, but we see most of the people want to use their credit cards to fund the transaction. We do see also strong growth on the ACH on the \u2013 in Europe. They don't call it ACH there. There's direct debit. There are companies like SOFORT, they help us to do that, pull out money from the banks, from consumer accounts. And that's growing also very well. But most of the transactions on the send side is just still done by credit cards.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from John Davis of Stifel.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, John.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hikmet, I wondered if you could maybe comment on any potential impact of the EU's new AML directive that just came out recently. Any impact there or thoughts would be helpful.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think that has any impact on our business currently. We probably follow the European Union rules obviously, and we don't see any big impact to our business because we've been doing this already, the regulations, and we adopted them already. One of the biggest things also is that, don't forget that we forget sometimes to mention it we do have a bank license in European Union, which is licensed in 27 European Union countries. And that helps us also. That also is a competitive advantage here. And then we did invest a lot on our anti-money laundering activities in European Union and we work closely with regulators there. I don't see big impact here.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, Raj, maybe a housekeeping item. I think, assuming that the tax rate is going to benefit from one-time items this year, is it safe to assume that it will likely trend back to the mid-teens next year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, yeah, I would even say for this year, if we didn't have the various discrete items that we talked about, we would be in the mid-teens range as we had originally thought. And we're not giving specific guidance for next year, but given what we know today and tax legislation's evolving all around the world, we would be probably in the mid-teens range for the next couple of years. But we need to see how things play out around the world. As you know, those things are evolving all the time.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, finally, I think, Raj, you mentioned on the call that 30% of the cash is in the U.S., so I think that puts it around $360 million. And then assume you're going to generate another $100 million-plus in free cash flow in the back half of this year. That gets you to a $475 million-ish cash number in the U.S. That's roughly what you paid out in the first half of the year. So, maybe just talk a little bit about the internal cash management policies and procedures you guys use and help give us comfort that there's plenty of cash in the U.S. to pay dividends and repurchases as we go into 2017.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Absolutely. Our dividends are easily payable, and that's something we have a heavy focus on obviously. We do have intercompany working capital programs that allow us to free up more cash here in the U.S. And I would also say that overtime we also will have more capacity from a debt standpoint. So there's plenty of availability of capital and the way we manage our cash overall. So I have no concerns there.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I understand we don't have any more questions in the queue, so we'll end the call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Laura. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2016 third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Western Union's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the 2015 Form 10-K for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.", "During the call, we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.

Overall, we are pleased that our diversified global business and strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another solid earnings performance in the third quarter. And we accomplished this while navigating current headwinds and macro challenges in some international markets.", "Our U.S. business remained strong. And westernunion.com money transfer accelerated nicely, increasing 28% in constant currency. This growth helped us balance all related softness in many of the Middle East and African countries.", "We delivered good margins, coming in at over 20%, despite negative impact from currency and the legal matter accrual. And we continue to generate strong cash flow and returned significant funds to our shareholders. We are on track to deliver on our full year earnings outlook and are affirming our earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.70.", "Total revenue in the quarter increased 2% on a constant currency basis, with the consumer money transfer business increasing 1%. Within money transfer, the U.S. business was strong across the board with good growth from both outbound and domestic money transfer. Our U.S. to Mexico business continues to shine and has now outpaced market growth for principal and transactions in each quarter for the past three years.", "In addition, we recently greatly expanded distribution in Mexico nearly doubling our network. This was driven by the activation of our transfers services at OXXO, which is Mexico's largest convenience store geographically with 14,000 locations. With this new service, customers can stage transactions on the phone in advance or through dedicated phones and digital kiosk in the stores and then receive their funds at the counter.", "Turning to westernunion.com, this quarter's revenue increase is impressive, given the larger size of our digital business relative to competitors. We continue to see tremendous growth from the mobile app and the westernunion.com business was particularly strong in the U.S. markets. We also continue to expand our digital assets rolling out mobile apps in Canada and additional countries in Europe, giving us 16 transactional mobile apps in the market among our 37 westernunion.com countries.", "In addition, in the U.S. and the UK, we have added a new omni-channel feature to our mobile apps. The customers can now fund 10 transactions from mobile apps via cards, accounts and also cash. This new feature allows consumers to start transactions on their smartphones and then pay with cash at agent locations adding convenience and reduce time for in-store transactions.", "As I mentioned earlier, remittance flows from the oil producing countries have been affected by the low oil price environment, while this is not a new factor, we did see softening in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key markets in the Gulf that had largely maintained growth trends until the middle of the year.", "Overall, the C2C pricing and competitive environment remains quite stable as we had not seen significant changes in the marketplace. While there were some announcement recently concerning price changes for competitive services in limited areas, we don't anticipate this having significant impact on our business. We are very well-positioned in the U.S. to Mexico corridor with our 50,000 agent locations in the U.S. and 26,000 in Mexico and the very competitive fee of $8 on sends up to $1,000.", "In the U.S. domestic money transfer market, all the certain competitors are lowering fees on very high principal transfer. This is a small piece of our business today. To put this in perspective, U.S. domestic money transfers over $1,000 represent less than 1% of company revenue. So overall, we are competitive with our current C2C product and pricing strategy and for the near future we do not anticipate major companywide pricing adjustments.", "Turning to the other segments, the consumer bill payment business again delivered double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter while business solutions was flat. All the business solutions had good growth from its payments product, especially verticals such as serving clients in the education sector, reductions in customer's hedging activities negatively impacted results. Strategically, we continue to advance our EDGE digital platform for importers and exporters. We have enabled thousands of business clients for use of the platform which recently won Payments Innovation award in London. So, overall, we remain on track to deliver our earnings outlook, even with the many challenges we have faced this year.", "Our strong financial position has allowed us to continue investing in our platforms including advancements in our digital technology and compliance assets and programs. And we are intent on further expanding our capabilities and network of digital and physical touch points. These include agent locations, mobile, online, accounts and kiosks, both direct and through our agent partners as we leverage our platforms to offer consumers and businesses freedom of choice in how and when they want to move money cross-border.", "We will talk more about our long-term strategies in the coming months, but right now I want to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results in more detail.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Hikmet. Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion declined 2% or increased 2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $52 million compared to the prior year.", "In the Consumer to Consumer segment, revenues declined 1% in the quarter or increased 1% in constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while regional growth was led by North America and Latin America.", "However, softness from the oil producing countries continued to negatively impact the Middle East and Africa and part of the Asia Pacific region. Total C2C cross-border principal declined 3% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 5% or 4% in constant currency terms.", "The spread between the C2C transaction growth and the revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 3 percentage points including a negative 2% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter and was affected by the principal per transaction decline, while pricing had a positive impact of 1%.", "Turning to the regions, consistent with prior quarters, I will be referring to constant currency movements, as I discuss individual country contributions to the regional results. North America continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. U.S. outbound sends to Mexico and Latin America drove the region's revenue growth. In Mexico, our business continued to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the third quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer business also posted good results, as revenue increased 4% and transaction growth improved to 5%.", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2% or increased 1% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 2%. Revenue growth was driven by Greece and the U.K., partially offset by declines in Turkey. As a reminder, Greece was impacted in the third quarter of last year by government imposed market restrictions on money transfers during the country's financial crisis.", "In the Middle East and Africa region, revenue declined 10% or 8% in constant currency and transactions were down 9%. Lower oil prices continued to affect the region's results in the quarter, with trends weakening since the last quarter in Saudi Arabia, Angola and the UAE.", "In the Asia Pacific region, revenue was down 4% or 3% in constant currency, while transactions decreased 5%. Received markets in the region including India continue to be negatively impacted by lower remittances from the oil producing countries. Revenue in the Latin America and Caribbean region grew 3% and increased 8% in constant currency, while transactions grew 12%.", "Revenue growth in the region was largely driven by the strong inbound business from the U.S. Included in the regional numbers discussed, westernunion.com's C2C revenue growth accelerated to 26% in the quarter or 28% in constant currency and represented 8% of total C2C revenue. westernunion.com transactions increased 29%, while U.S. originated online transactions grew 33%.", "In the Consumer to Business segment, revenue declined 3% or increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue was driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. The depreciation of the Argentine peso continued to cause the decline in the reported revenues.", "Business Solutions revenues declined 4%. On a constant currency basis, revenues were flat, as good growth in Europe was offset by reduced customer hedging activities, particularly in Australia and Canada.", "Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior year period. This quarter's operating margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from a $15 million accrual related to a previously disclosed FTC legal matter. This is in addition to the $15 million we accrued for this in the second quarter, as we have not reached an appropriate resolution with the FTC at this time.", "Other negative impacts on the margin included foreign exchange, customer and funding mix in the electronic bill payments business and incremental technology expense, which were partially offset by lower compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. Foreign exchange hedge gains in the quarter were $12 million compared to $21 million of gains in the third quarter of last year.", "We continue to expect approximately $45 million in hedge gains for the year. Based on recent rates and our current hedge position, we currently project about $15 million of gains for 2017. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $22 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year.", "Compliance expense has been steady and came in at 3.5% of revenue in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 25.0%, down from 27.1% in the prior year period as a result of the same negative factors that affected operating margin. The tax rate of 9.6% benefited from a 160-basis-point impact from the FTC accrual and compared to 12.5% in the third quarter of last year. We still expect a full year rate of approximately 12%. Earnings per share was $0.44 in the quarter, including a negative $0.02 impact for the additional FTC accrual and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of last year.", "The C2C segment operating margin of 23.4% was down from 25.5% in the prior year period and was negatively affected by 140 basis points from the accrual. The C2C margin was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange and higher technology expense which were partially offset by lower compensation related costs.", "The Consumer to Business operating margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business. The mix impacts related to the addition of a large new biller and lower margins and general increases in credit card usage as a funding option by consumers.", "Business Solutions operating profit was $3 million or a 3.5% margin compared to a loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The operating profit improvement was driven by lower depreciation and amortization expense which relates to the write-down for a contract termination in the third quarter of last year.", "Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $13 million in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 17.1% which compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of last year.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $822 million year-to-date through September. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.2 billion and cash of $1.3 billion with approximately 50% of the cash held by United States entities.", "After the quarter, in October, we retired $1 billion of maturing notes which had a coupon of 5.93%. We funded this maturity by drawing down on a $575 million term loan facility which carries interest rates of LIBOR plus 150 basis points, and through a combination of cash usage and commercial paper issuance.", "During the third quarter, we paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4 million shares for a total of $84 million. Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2017, was $310 million at quarter end and the outstanding share count at the end of September was 485 million shares.", "Turning to our outlook for the full year, we are narrowing the revenue growth outlook while affirming operating profit margin to EPS range and operating cash flow. The updated revenue outlook for the year is an increase of approximately 3% constant currency which should translate to a decrease of approximately 1% on a GAAP basis.", "Operating profit margin for the full year remains approximately 20% while EPS remains in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. We have been able to maintain the margin outlook despite the unanticipated $30 million of legal matter accruals during the year due to favorability and other expenses. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, and we now expect the $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously announced IRS agreements to be paid in 2017.", "So, to summarize, we delivered solid results in the quarter and remain on track with our full year earnings outlook. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and we continue to return significant funds to shareholders.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.", "Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, guys. This is Ryan Cary for Jason. Clearly, low oil prices continue to be a headwind to results. Should we expect negative growth as kind of the new normal for the time being in the petro producing regions or the impact less structural in these regions could recover relatively quickly with a rebound in energy prices?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I think we did see some impact which \u2013 especially from the Middle East and Middle East-related oil producing countries. That's a fact. But I will say, overall, being in 200 countries, having that portfolio, that balances the strong U.S. growth. The strong westernunion.com digital growth accelerating the transactions and revenues is really a great result.", "It has \u2013 I would say, it takes time, right? If the oil prices are higher, the jobs have to be created, the investments have to be done in Saudi Arabia or UAE and Middle East countries, that creates jobs and if the people have jobs, they send money. But as you know, putting things in perspective, it's a good part of business but not that big part of business. And being in 200 countries helps us to have good results.", "Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC", "Great. And just a follow-up. How should we be thinking about the tax rate going forward? I believe you call that expectation is for kind of a mid-teens tax rate over the next couple of years. But it seems like over the last three years to four years, that's often been the initial assumption before coming in a couple hundred basis points lighter. So is this a trend that we shouldn't expect to continue going forward or \u2013 and I'm trying to get a sense of how we should think about the tax rate, particularly, after kind of the lighter than expected this quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Ryan, this is Raj. We still target a mid-teens tax rate, and that's still what we expect for the next couple of years based on what we know today about the tax laws and the current environment with our business.", "We've continue to benefit from some discrete items that have helped us during the course of the year. In this quarter, for example, we \u2013 obviously, we have a benefit from the larger accrual in the U.S. which helps to \u2013 helps the mix on the overall tax rate. We also have had some favorable resolutions to various outstanding tax matters with various governments around the world. And so that continues to help us and we're going to continue to try to do that as much as we can. Putting aside the discrete items, we're probably in that mid-teens rate, which is what we fully expected when we came into this year, but we are doing a good job in trying to manage things as best as we can on the tax side and that continues to be our goal.", "Ryan A. Cary - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Jim.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the acceleration in the westernunion.com business, kind of the \u2013 some of the geographies that might have been underlying that and I guess if you can kind of look forward, talk about some of the factors that might help you close the gap between transaction growth and revenue growth?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "So, Jim, this is good news, right? This fantastic news, our acceleration of dotcom especially given the size how big our westernunion.com business already is, 8% of our total revenue and accelerating where 28% and transaction by 29%. The growth comes from both sides, expansion geographically and \u2013 but also very strong U.S. business, which have been for many, many years so customers are returning using us, they love the app, the westernunion.com app. Our transactions in the U.S. are growing by 33% and that's amazing and we are really gaining there market share and getting new customers, still the customers are new, 80% of the customers using westernunion.com digital environment are new to Western Union, they didn't use in the last 12 months, or, Raj, right? They did not use us the last 12 months and it's a great story and then now we are in 16 countries.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "27 countries.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "And the westernunion.com 16 countries on mobile app and we recently also launched new features in Canada and UK where you can really stage transaction. If somebody doesn't want to use bank account or credit card, they can go to a location and stage a transaction, pay at the location. So these things are definitely a multi-product and multi-channel environments helping. The other thing is also, what the competitors don't have and that's why they are not growing that fast is that we are in 200 countries. We can drop money in 16,000 corridors with one app. From Canada you can send money to 200 countries. From U.K. you can send money to 200 countries, from 37 countries, electronically digital, you can send money. That's the growth part. So we are very pleased with our digital growth and that's going to continue. Our investment is going to continue and my expectations will be \u2013 I'm very motivated with that.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "That's good to hear. Thanks. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. There's been a lot of headlines around the Walmart U.S. to Mexico kind of pricing structures that they recently published. Can you maybe talk about whether you expect any potential knock-on effect relative to the rest of the market and I know Walmart is pretty small, but still I guess there's a speculation about whether that could have a broader market affect or where you think it's just going to be confined to simply Walmart?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, I wouldn't say Walmart is small, in particular, but in this business, it is small. We have 50,000 locations in the U.S. and 26,000 locations in Mexico. And our pricing has been very competitive also, $8 for up to $1,000. And the facts speak its language. We've been gaining market share for three years every quarter and these facts are from Banco de M\u00e9xico facts.", "So the distribution, the product positioning, the pricing, the brands, the compliance programs, all these platforms help us to be gaining market share. So we will always do pricing actions corridor by corridor. We will look at that, but I feel quite competitive with our pricing and I see the pricing is very stable and we're going to continue hopefully gaining market share in this very important corridor for us.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the pricing front. I think I heard plus 1%. So where are you being more opportunist, is this change more on the FX side or transaction-based side. Just any more color there would be great.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Well, Tien-Tsin, you know our business so well. We are in \u2013 as you know, we are in so many countries, so many bands, so many different things. I would say that generally we still have 15% to 20% premium on average globally. Our price has been not affected and we will \u2013 the increases come on FX, most of the time FX increases but in some corridors also in the fee, and in some corridors we decreased actually also prices. And as you know, being in so many corridors, being in so many countries, it's a portfolio management. We feel comfortable by gaining market share also in some corridors, increasing the FX rates, that helped also, and it's mix \u2013 basically, it's the mix. It's not a big increase obviously. It's really the mix that impacts our 1%.", "Raj, is that the truth?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I think you answered it well. There was some volatility, as the Brexit activity took place at the end of the second quarter. And that's \u2013 we put some different spreads in place. So that helped us, Tien-Tsin, overall in the business from a pricing standpoint, but we do increases and decreases on an ongoing basis throughout our business.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. No, that's good to know. Just on the Business Solutions side, any change in how we should look at that in the fourth quarter and maybe into 2017. I know that FX is all over the place and sort of macro trade is all over the place. I don't know if there has been a share change as well. But any updated insight on Business Solutions?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure. On Business Solutions, if you look at the Business Solutions, we are very pleased with our payment sector, the verticals where the students pay as a payment. On the hedging side, volatility always helps, right? The global trade has been slow, Tien-Tsin. That's been mainly affected and especially in the countries we are operating has been slow. Saying that, we will \u2013 we are still very strategic, very important for us. That's why we invested in the EDGE digital platform. We have thousands of exporters and importers registered there. They are trading in this platform. And that will be definitely helping on long-term on our numbers. But short term, volatility will help us and the global trade will help us.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. As always, I appreciate it.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Tien-Tsin.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Tien-Tsin.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. How are you doing?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hello, Bryan.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi. Good. Good. How are you?", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good, good. Just wanted to ask about the guidance. It looks like you guys narrowed the revenue guidance range to 3% in constant currency. And I believe the first half of the year was 3% constant currency. Third quarter was 2% in constant currency. So I'm just trying to figure are you guys expecting a little bit of a pickup in constant currency revenue growth in 4Q to round out the 3%?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "We just \u2013 we said approximately 3%, Bryan. So it obviously can be a range of outcomes for the fourth quarter and it still give us 3% for the full year, but that's approximately 3% for the full year. That's about where we've been running throughout the first three quarters of the year and that's about where we expect for the full year.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then you narrowed kind of the revenue range, but you didn't narrow the earnings per share and obviously there's still a $0.10 range there, which is a wide variety of outcomes for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what would get you to the low end of the range and to the high end of the range and maybe where you guys feel more comfortable?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Well, I would say we feel comfortable with the range as it is. We didn't really change the range primarily because we've also taken into account the $30 million of additional legal accruals that we've had now through the last couple of quarters. For us, the outlook really hasn't changed a lot. We continue to see the business trending the way it has been. We reiterated margins at 20%. We also have the same cash flow outlook and our EPS range, we just didn't change it because of the \u2013 what we've \u2013 because of legal items but you can see that through the first three quarter and even in the third quarter, we got to an EPS of $0.44, which is very much in line with our expectations and we feel good about the full-year outlook.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I think, Raj, we talked about that we wouldn't have the $30 million, that outlook would be different, it would be on the higher end.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, we would have probably updated the outlook have we not had the $30 million that we've taken into account.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. But no real one-time items to think about on a comparable basis from 4Q last year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "No, no, not really. If we have any one-time type items or things that we might do to address the cost structure, we will certainly tell you about those once we finish out the year but nothing that we can discuss at this stage. We are always looking for cost efficiencies and opportunities for the business but nothing to call out at this stage.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Darrin.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up around the margin, I mean, it does seem like there were some items in there and obviously you have been able to maintain it relatively stable despite that. So, I guess, can you just maybe rewind and give us a sense of what you see as the operating leverage opportunity? In other words, if we were to show 3% growth once again in 2017, I mean, is there any reason to see \u2013 to expect \u2013 to not be able to expect some margin expansion on that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, Darrin, I can't talk about 2017 margins, but the reason we've been able to maintain the margin this year at around 20% is we have managed our expenses quite tightly. Even though we've taken into account an additional $30 million of legal cost, we've been able to do that. For us, obviously, we need to get good revenue growth to drive better profitability but then you have to look at our other cost items that will have an impact, obviously, like our commissions, which have been flat the last couple of years, our compliance costs have also been relatively stable at that 3.5% to 4% range. And then, as I mentioned, just earlier we are continuing to look for cost optimization opportunities. So all of those things will have an impact and will have more color for you on those things as we finish out the year. But the margin this year, we are pleased with the 20% operating margin outlook, even in the face of some of these other things that we've had to deal with.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "And prices are stable from top-line; that helps also. And also just generally I would say that the company is really operating in a much better way, more efficient way. Despite all the challenges, global challenges, I think we found a way to operate very effectively.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the guidance question. I understand you're saying it's just 3% and there's a lot of outcomes that can get you there. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out what may have been in your expectations beforehand to be low to mid-single digit top-line versus now 3%. What changed, I guess, and again, we understand it's not a massive move from one to the other, but...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "...anything will be helpful?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Well, we had been running at 3% for the first half of the year on a constant currency basis and we still have six months left in the year when we maintained our outlook last quarter, low to mid-single digits. But as we've seen it tick down in the business, given the oil related markets. We're more comfortable with the 3% revenue growth outlook because of the performance that we had in the third quarter. And it's really the Middle East, the oil related markets that have shown a tick-down because we are continuing to get very strong growth in the other markets like the U.S., up on to Mexico, to Latin America, the domestic business, the digital business, obviously, and so those trends haven't really changed. We've seen just the tick-down in the Middle East and Africa business which is impacting APAC as well.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. That's helpful. And just quick one, I mean on the mobile side, last quarter I know you guys had a bit of a spread between the revenue growth rate and the transaction growth. It actually looked like, to the point mentioned earlier by someone, it definitely improved. Not only you commented on mobile being a driver of the acceleration on wu.com but can you help us understand why the revenue per transaction would've improved so much given how much is mobile?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, I mean, we're continuing to see very strong growth in the mobile channel for wu.com and we're pleased with that. So that hasn't changed from before. As we mentioned before, we do pricing optimization throughout our business including our various channels and we did increase some spreads in the dotcom business but our overall pricing in the dotcom business is very market competitive when you look at the rest of the competition. So we're just really aligning and maximizing the opportunity there, and we're getting very consistent growth with transaction growth now, 29% transaction growth and 28% constant currency revenue growth. So it's a pretty consistent picture and it's very consistent with what we had expected coming into the second half of this year.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. All right. All right. Sounds good. Thanks, guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks. Thanks, Darrin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj. How are you?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So I have a question about that legal accrual. I think your presentation did mention that there was an offset compensation in D&A. If you could size that, that would be helpful. And then as we kind of all start thinking about next year's model, what are the headwinds and tailwinds? Is it fair to assume that on the headwind side there is probably about $0.05 of tax rate but on the tailwind side you probably have the hedge roll-off that you don't have anymore? Can you help kind of with the timing of that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Ashwin, let me try to answer your questions. In the SG&A line, as you mentioned, we had the FTC legal accrual for $15 million. That's the size of it. There were some offsets with lower compensation and lower D&A. And SG&A as a percent of revenues was up just a little bit from the last year. So I'll just let you do the math. But there was a slight...", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. The D&A, as we mentioned in the Business Solutions, that was a one-time charge we took a year ago in D&A. So there is about $7 million difference in that Business Solutions D&A.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "And the rest of it is just the comp. As you look at next year, I can't really go into specifics. But there are a number of different factors to consider \u2013 all of the things that I've mentioned in the previous question around revenue growth as well as the various cost items. But tax will certainly be a consideration.", "Putting aside any discrete items, as I mentioned earlier, for the next couple of years, we would probably be in the mid-teens area for tax rate. But as I also mentioned, we're always trying to look for opportunities to optimize our tax rate. We will have some interest savings as we go into next year because of the refinancing that we just did.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "The ultimate amount of interest savings will depend on our debt level. And then we also have a refinancing next year that we have to do. So there may be some negative carry related to that. And then we also have the hedge gains that will \u2013 if rates stay exactly where they are today, then we'll have less in hedge gains. So all of those things will have to come together in how we ultimately look from a profit standpoint.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. So, okay, I guess, the follow-up question is just a clarification. In your presentation, again, in that C2C chart where you provide the transaction to revenue bridge, if there is other mix and I might have missed what the expectation for the other mix was?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, I mean, it's very simply \u2013 we had lower growth or softness in higher RPT markets. Our principal per transaction was down by about 4% on a constant currency basis and that's largely been driven by Europe and certain parts of the Middle East. So it's really the mix impact that's showing up in that negative 2%.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. Thanks. See you next week.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure. Thanks, yeah. See you next week.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hi. Good evening, Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi. How are you?", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good. I wanted to \u2013 the wu.com, as you talked about the transactions and revenue are coming in closer and seems as though you've been able to manage the spread there. Is that a result of you pricing differently or is that the result of the competition being less aggressive and allowing you to manage pricing better?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, I can't speak in the name of competition, what their issues is that \u2013 their issues, I guess, mostly they can't expand globally and they don't have the power to expand globally and they don't have the \u2013 they can't drop money to the 2 billion accounts we have and they can't drop money to 500,000 locations and everything, right? I think the strong growth is two things, Kartik. First one is the customers are coming back, who use once mobile, they love it, they stay there, they are coming back. We see that very good and that's the U.S. growth besides getting more customers, we are really having returning customers.", "And the team is doing good job on that communicating with them online with via mobile, really having a loyalty programs which is great getting them back. The second thing is the geographical expansion. Expansion in Canada, expansion in UK with new devices but also in Europe and now we are starting to expand that also, you'll see recent announcement, coming announcement in other countries, in Asia, and other parts of Europe, in Middle East, we're going to expand our online and our dotcom activities and mobile activities. And it's a good business to expand, Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, I would just add, Kartik, that one unique feature that we have that most of the competition does not have is cash payout. We initiate transactions online but we have a vast retail network that really sets us apart from other competitors.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "That link is definitely the compliance programs and you have to have a license to operate in a country. And that's not easy to get it. And we've been there for many, many years and we are really building our digital transformation. The digital transformation is happening built on our fundamentals and the other \u2013 the competition has to probably get there first.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And then just on overall pricing, obviously, you had a positive impact. Anything that you see on the horizon that changes that or do you think this environment, you'll be able to kind of sustain the pricing levels that there are right now?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, if you look at, the market is quite stable, right? I don't see any big noise out there. There has been some announcements done by the competition, but we feel we are pretty well positioned. Overall, we still have 15% to 20% premium globally and so we will continue the pricing actions but it won't have \u2013 we're going to stay in our historical norm and that will have been \u2013 we feel comfortable on that. For the near future, I don't see big changes.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And then just last question, Raj, just want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said, I know you don't want to give 2017 guidance, I understand that, but you were talking about some of the things that we should consider. On interest expense, did you say you thought that would be a headwind or did you not say that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "I did not say that. I said that interest expense would likely be lower next year given the refinancing we've done. Part of the refinancing was with the term loan, as I mentioned in our comments, which is at LIBOR plus 150 basis points, which is lower obviously than the note that we just retired at 5.93% and then we use some commercial paper. So we'll get interest savings there but it might be offset with some other components that I also mentioned and then we also have another refinancing to do next year of $500 million, which is at the end of the year, but we may refinance that earlier in the year, so there could be some negative carry as well associated with that.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Kartik.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Laura, I understand there is one more question in the queue.", "Operator", "Yes, that question is from Matt O'Neill of Autonomous.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Yeah, hi. It's Craig Maurer for Matt O'Neill. Just a broad-based question. You had stated in the prepared comments that you're comfortable with pricing where it is now. But should the oil economies not recover and the global economy remains suspect, do you have any other pricing leverage other than risk that you could use to reverse the decline in transaction growth?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, if you look at our business, I mean, there is a global challenge. It's for all, right? It's not a competitive challenge. It affects everyone. I think that in the markets where we feel very competitive with pricing \u2013 as I said earlier, we will always do pricing. That's the beauty of having this portfolio. And we didn't do 16,000 corridors. We have different customer use case. We have different bands, receiving center, FX and fees. So we can do that \u2013 we're going to continue to do that, and I feel comfortable where it is.", "I think it was more of noise out there with the announcements and currently \u2013 near future, what I hear from my market leaders, they feel comfortable. What I hear from our digital leaders, they feel very comfortable that \u2013 and we are growing with our numbers. 28% digital growth is impressive, very stable, very resilient retail business. And for the near future, I don't see, I can't predict the future \u2013 long-term future, but I feel comfortable where the business is.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. All right. So just thinking ahead, I know you don't want to comment on 2017. But I mean, your positive comments seem to be slanted toward some level of recovery in those markets. So I suppose, as we think out to the guide, should you not get a \u2013 should you not get any improvement in the oil economies, we should probably expect a continuation of trend seeing the quarter.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, I can't predict the economy \u2013 the oil prices, right? I can't predict the global economy. And that's something I am always cautious. And I said at the beginning of the year, 2016 is cautious. And today I am still saying cautious, right?", "But the beauty of our business, if you look at our top two business, not only U.S. but worldwide, we've been always up and down. And currently in the U.S., we're doing a good job. Outbound and intra-business is doing very well, digital doing very well.", "Parts of like UK, although there were Brexit talk and everything, UK business is doing very well. Our Australia business is doing well. We do have \u2013 impacted in Saudi Arabia and UAE where they send money mostly to South Asia. This corridor has been impacted. And that's why some parts of the like India corridors has been a slower growth, because Saudi Arabia send and UAE send has been slower.", "Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Okay, thanks, Craig. I think that's all the questions we have in the queue. So I want to thank everyone for joining us and wish you have a good evening.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded.

Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Lara. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2017 first quarter results, and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements.

We've reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section. We'll also discuss certain adjusted metrics.", "Although the expenses that have been excluded from adjusted metrics are specific to unique initiatives, the type of expenses maybe similar to type of expenses that the company has previously incurred and can recently be expected to incur in the future.", "All statements made by the Western Union officers on this call are the property of The Western Union Company and subject to copyright protection. Other than the replay noted in our press release, Western Union has not authorized and disclaims responsibility for any recording, replay or distribution of any transcription of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Hikmet Ersek.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid business performance in the first quarter, and we also continue to make important progress on our key strategic initiatives. Overall, the quarter's business results were consistent with our full year expectations. Revenue increased 3% in constant currency terms led by strong digital growth in consumer money transfer and the double-digit increase in our consumer bill payment business.", "Westernunion.com money transfer continued its trend of excellent results with revenue increasing 28% constant currency. Geographically, in C2C, our Latin America and Caribbean outbound business was very strong. North America and Europe posted good constant currency growth, while the oil producing countries in the Middle East and Africa continue to be challenged as expected.", "From a profit standpoint, operating margins were solid and we also returned over $300 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in the quarter. Our earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by a higher than usual tax rate due to timing of some items, but we don't expect this to impact our full year earnings, and we are confirming our full year EPS outlook.", "Operationally, we continued implementation of the WU Way business transformation program. While we are operating from a position of strength, we are also redesigning our organization structures to drive enhanced focus on end-to-end full service delivery for our customers.", "We are progressing the cost efficiency initiative and technology organization optimization, and we are continuing to implement lean management into our operations. With these lean management techniques, we will improve the customer experience. We have initiated pilot programs of cross-functional teams analyzing our customer experience value streams, identifying issues, assessing root causes, and developing solutions.", "Currently identified solutions include providing more digital self-service options, piloting of customer care centers of excellence and enhancing capabilities in our agent point-of-sale technology. In addition to the potential cost efficiency opportunities, these changes are intended to lead to better customer experience and stronger retention over time.", "The WU Way programs are also supporting long-term growth initiatives, and we are making good progress in key areas. As we drive toward our vision of being a recognized leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement, our strategic focus continues to be on expanding mobile and online, building our account payout network, and improving and enhancing customer experience across our portfolio.", "We have already had several advances in our digital business in 2017. We expanded our online distribution, as we now have 40 countries with Western Union transaction sites, including all the European Union countries, and 18 mobile apps with the ability to send money to more than 200 countries and territories.", "In the first quarter, over 60% of our westernunion.com transactions were initiated on mobile. We also added Apple Pay as a payment option on westernunion.com in the U.S., and we launched a bot, which allows our money transfer service to be accessed through Facebook Messenger in the U.S.", "Our account payout network continues to expand with access to billions of accounts. Although revenues are still currently small, account payouts represented over 30% of westernunion.com U.S. outbound principal in the quarter, and we have dedicated teams working on expanding this business.", "We have various initiatives underway to improve the customer experience not only through WU Way but also through implementing services such as app-initiated retail, which allows consumers to initiate transaction on their mobile devices and complete them at agent locations. All these actions give us confidence in the opportunities for our business.", "Obviously, there has been a lot of news in the money transfer space in recent months with the potential acquisition of one of our competitors. We believe this demonstrates the value of our global network, especially the retail and digital combination in cross-border money movement as well as the importance of global presence both in terms of capabilities and regulatory licenses and infrastructure.", "Now, regardless of how the external situation play out, our resilient global business model has shown solid results over the last several quarters. We will continue to focus on business execution and implementation of long-term strategic actions, including expanding our digital assets and optimizing our operating model. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we delivered solid business performance. We will continue to give you updates on our strategic progress throughout the year.", "But now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the first quarter results in more detail.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Hikmet. First quarter reported revenues of $1.3 billion were flat or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period. The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $30 million compared to the prior year.", "In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues were flat in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%. C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion.com, while geographically growth was driven by Latin America, North America and Europe and CIS regions. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 2% or 1% in constant currency terms.", "The 1% cross-border principal increase was an improvement from the 1.5% decline we reported for the 2016 full year. Last month, the World Bank updated its cross-border remittance principal estimates, and its data indicates the overall market declined 1.2% in 2016, following a 2.7% decline in 2015.", "Factors cited by the World Bank for the decline last year included low oil prices, weak economies in the Gulf states and Russia, reduced flows from Europe to Africa and the translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The World Bank is projecting an improvement in 2017, driven by stronger global economic outlook.", "Returning to the first quarter results, the spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter, while pricing had a positive impact of approximately 2%, primarily driven by price increases implemented last year, and that remained in place. We continue to view the current pricing environment as stable.", "Turning to the regions, we implemented a new regional structure this quarter in our C2C segment due to some leadership and organizational changes. Changes include a few modifications in the country composition of the segments by geographic regions, which we detailed in an 8-K we published last week and are also available in our 10-Q.", "In addition, we have changed the methodology of our regional reporting to allocate 100% of revenues to the send region rather than our previous practice of splitting the revenues 50-50 based on the region in which the money was originated and the region in which it was received. We believe this new methodology provides you with a better understanding of where our business is originated around the world, and how economic trends and other macro events may affect our results. We have provided the 2016 historical quarterly regional results using this method in the filings I just mentioned.", "So, turning to the regions, regional results for the first quarter, I'll be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regions' results. North America again generated good growth in the quarter with revenue increasing 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions grew 5%. U.S. outbound, particularly to Latin American countries, continue to be a strong grower. U.S. to Mexico business increased, although growth trends were not as good as the very strong results we delivered in the fourth quarter.", "The strengthening of the Mexican peso likely contributed to a slowdown in the market growth for the quarter. However, our Mexico business did continue to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de M\u00e9xico principal and transaction data for the first quarter. Our U.S. domestic money transfer revenue was somewhat softer, primarily due to the impact of some price decreases we implemented in parts of the market in the second half of last year.", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 1% or increased 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 8%. Revenue growth in the region is consistent with the fourth quarter, while transactions benefited from growth of lower-priced transactions in Russia. In the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region, revenue declined 13% or 10% constant currency, and transactions were down 15% as low oil prices continued to negatively affect key send markets.", "The regions' results were also impacted by reduced sends from these countries into India. Total inbound business to India was down just over 20% in the quarter. That compared to the 30% revenue decrease we saw in November and December following the government demonetization actions, and we did see month-by-month improvement in the trends during the quarter.", "In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 2% or 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 2%. Business originating in the Latin America and Caribbean region was very strong. Revenue grew 26% or 25% constant currency, while transactions grew 17%, led by Argentina and several other markets.", "A combination of strong economic performance and currencies, market reforms, previous pricing actions and marketing programs helped drive the regions growth. Westernunion.com's C2C revenue continued its strong performance trend with revenue increasing 26% or 28% constant currency on 27% transaction growth. Westernunion.com represented 9% of total C2C revenue in the quarter, up from 7% in the first quarter of last year.", "In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 8% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue growth continued to be driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S. electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S. cash walk-in. Business Solutions revenues declined 6% or 3% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of XE.com business.", "Revenues were also impacted by a decline in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in some markets. Geographically, good growth in Europe was offset by declines in North America and Asia-Pacific.", "Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin in the quarter was 18.4%. Excluding the impact of costs related to the WU Way transformation program, adjusted operating margin was 19.5% in the quarter, which compares to 19.9% in the prior year period.", "The adjusted margin decline was driven by the impact of foreign exchange and customer and funding mix in C2B, partially offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend. Foreign exchange hedges in the quarter had a positive impact of $7 million, down from a benefit of $15 million in the first quarter of 2016.", "We continue to expect approximately $25 million in hedge benefits for the full year compared to $48 million of benefit in 2016. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $15 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year.", "Compliance expense was 3.7% of revenue for this first quarter, and we still expect to be in the higher end of the 3.5% to 4% of revenues range for the full year. We recorded $14 million of WU Way expenses in the quarter, while expected savings are weighted more towards the second half of the year.", "EBITDA margin was 23.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding WU Way expenses, was 24.6% compared to 25% in the prior year period. The decline was due to the same factors that affected our operating margin.", "The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%. Excluding the impact of WU Way-related expenses, the adjusted tax rate was 24.8%, which compares to 14.6% in the prior-year period. The higher tax rate in the quarter was due to the impact of changes in the internal ownership structure of certain of the company's international subsidiaries, which were implemented to help address upcoming regulatory changes in Europe. The first quarter negative impact is expected to be largely offset by lower taxes of a comparable amount over the remainder of the year, resulting from the structural changes.", "The GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 in the first quarter includes a negative $0.02 impact from the WU Way-related expenses. Excluding these expenses, adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 compares to $0.37 in the first quarter of last year with the decline primarily driven by the higher tax rate.", "The C2C margin was 22.4%, which compares to 22.7% in the prior year period, has a negative impact of foreign exchange and offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend.", "The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 12.2% in the quarter compared to 14.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S. electronic business, including increased credit card usage, although the margin improved substantially relative to the fourth quarter.", "Business Solutions operating profit margin was 2.5% in the quarter compared to 2.4% in the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior year period. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 13.7%, which compare to 15.1% in the first quarter of 2016 with the decline primarily caused by higher technology expense.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet in the first quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $86 million, which includes $151 million of payments related to the settlement with the Federal and state governments announced in January, and approximately $19 million of WU Way-related payments. Excluding these items, cash flow from operating activities was $256 million in the quarter. The remaining $440 million of legal settlement payments will be made in the second quarter.", "Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $1.3 billion with approximately half of the cash held by United States entities.", "During the quarter, we issued $400 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 3.6%. We also returned $308 million to shareholders, including $83 million in dividend and $225 million of share repurchases, which equated to approximately 11 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 472 million shares, and we had $1.2 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.", "Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full year outlook. We expect GAAP revenue to be flat to down low-single digits with constant currency revenue increasing in the low-single digits. GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% and adjusted operating margin approximately 20%, excluding approximately $100 million of WU Way-related expenses. Our outlook include savings of approximately $20 million from deficiency actions included in the WU Way initiatives in 2017, and we expect approximately $25 million of additional savings in 2018.", "In addition to the impact from the subsidiary ownership structure, we also expect other discrete tax benefits in the fourth quarter, which we're anticipated in our original outlook. For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 11%, while the adjusted rate is expected to be approximately 13%.", "Quarterly, we anticipate rates closer to our full year outlook in the second and third quarters, and then a very low tax rate in Q4. We continue to expect full year GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the WU Way-related expenses, in the range of $1.63 to $1.75.", "Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $200 million in 2017 due to the impact of the $591 million payments related to the settlement agreement with the U.S. and State governments announced in January to be approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously-announced IRS agreement in December 2011 and the WU Way-related payment. Excluding these items, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion.", "So, to summarize, the first quarter business performance was solid, strategic progress continued and we are on track with our full-year outlook.", "Operator, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Tien-Tsin.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the detail. So, it looks like just trend-wise volume in C2C pretty stable, pricing actually a little bit better. So, Hikmet, I want to ask you, I know you travel a lot and you meet with a lot of different regulators, government entities, et cetera. Have you sensed a change in tone in sort of the regulation and regulatory environment on the business side, whether it's in the U.S. or outside the U.S, I'm curious if you change your thinking around the risk or opportunity there?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Not really, Tien-Tsin. I mean, there's a lot of noise obviously. But at this point, it's hard to measure the impact. In fact, our U.S. outbound business to Latin America business has been extremely strong, and our Mexico business a little bit slower than Q4, but still strong in Q1. Recent data just came actually, yesterday or something like that, the data from Banco de M\u00e9xico. We are still beating the other competitors, and we are better than the market data.", "Overall, a lot of noise on the protective environment, on the immigrant environment all over, but I think the governments also regulated (22:05). When I talk to them, they do realize that it's important to use the formal channels to transfer money. They do realize that they understand that the regulated environment is the best to send money and support actually also the people that come from. I think that sentiment is there to support us. I don't see any big noise yet, noise more on the media, more on the published words, but less on the impact on our remittance market.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's good to hear. And maybe just for you, Raj, just on the margin side, gross margin, I guess, overall margin. I mean, I know there's a lot of puts and takes. I heard a little bit about funding mix, and I guess we'll have some WU Way benefits coming in the \u2013 later on towards end of the year. So, can you help us think about 2Q versus exit rate margin? What are some of the things that we should focus on there? Obviously, the full year margin, I understand, but just thinking about the walk through that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, yeah. I mean, as we go through the course of the year, Tien-Tsin, we should get benefits from the cost savings initiatives. Most of that benefit will hit us in the second half of the year. And then, based on our current forecast for foreign exchange rates, we think that FX impact will be a little bit less in the second half of the year, so you get a pickup on those items. We had somewhat of a marketing benefit in the first quarter, and I expect that we'll get back to our normal averages for marketing spend, there's some timing in the first quarter. So that will also pick up. So, net-net, that's how we get back to roughly our 20% adjusted margin for the full year, and some of the things that will happen from a quarterly standpoint.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And to clarify the funding mix piece of it, I know it's probably pretty small, but is that reversible?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is that...?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. It's the way \u2013 in our consumer bill payments business, we're seeing \u2013 we had couple of things happening over the course of the last year. We had a large customer that we brought on at lower margins, and then we also saw consumers using credit cards to make payments, and that's a more expensive transaction for us. So, it ends up being more expensive for us. And although margins were down from the first quarter of last year, we actually did improve quite a bit from the fourth quarter where we were in the C2B business. So, the goal there has been to get really good top-line growth, and we're getting a lot of success there, we're adding to the portfolio. And then that gives us an opportunity to stabilize margins and maybe improve them over time.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Got it. Thank you so much.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Darrin.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Darrin.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys, thanks. Look, it's good to see pricing was stable on the quarter again. Obviously, it does seem, we're seeing incremental competition from innovators across the ecosystem. So, I just want to make sure, I mean, should we expect pricing in your view to remain stable, let's call, in the next 12 months to 24 months. It's just a bit of a shift obviously than what we saw two years, three years ago. And then, just any further thoughts on the industry implications of one of your largest competitors potentially being acquired, whether it's depending regardless of who buys them?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Let me \u2013 you are right, Darrin. Pricing is stable, it has been stable for the last three years. And I think we don't see any big movements. I think, the pricing is stable in the market, and for short-term, I see that it's going to stay stable. There are always corridor adjustments. There are always some markets up and down, but generally I would say that it's stable and on average, our premium like 15% to 20% pricing are being higher than the competitors. It's staying there, given our network, given our brand, given our competitive advantage, global advantage. I think we're going to \u2013 we feel comfortable with our pricing action. We will continue to do in certain corridors pricing, and we will continue to adjust that and sometime it's FX, sometimes it's fee, sometimes it's putting the price higher, sometime it's lowering, and managing 16,000 corridor in 200 countries has been our strength, and we're going to continue to do that.", "Now, I can't tell you about the competition \u2013 the new owner of the competitors are, when that will go through or not, I can't do that, that has to be approved by the different regulatory environment in the U.S. and how long it will take. But I can only tell you that we are extremely focused in the market. And I can say that our team, our regional heads, our corridor heads, our marketing heads, our people have been very focused and delivering pretty good.", "I do \u2013 from an agent side, they are also asking us what that means, the new environment, I can't tell you what's the new environment is, but I believe that the competitors want to make also money and want to be successful in the market and serve the customer in a right way, and we're going to compete on the market.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. All right. So it sounds like you do expect continued stability around pricing at least over the near-term?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Near-term of \u2013 yes, I mean, it's always hard to predict the future \u2013 long, long future about near-time, yes.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "And I feel like they're quite good. Our fundamentals are good to respond to specific corridors. We can immediately respond to that if there is any pressure in certain corridors in certain countries.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. That's good to hear. And then, just a quick follow-up on \u2013 I know you mentioned some comments around the India demonetization and some progress being seen on a monthly basis even. Could you just provide a little more thought around the long-term stability in the region for you guys there? When would you expect that to be back to normal again?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I think, we see improvements. I think, there is more cash in the market, so people are getting more cash and will be paying us in our 100,000 locations. But one thing you should not forget is, one of the major corridors is the Middle East to India. And oil prices has been low, and you see the impact of that mix to India. But one of the very strong corridors for us is the U.S. to India on our digital part. And we're dropping money not only there on the cash, we're dropping money also on account. In fact, most of the transactions are going to an account there from online. So, it is really the portfolio management.", "I would say that it will stabilize. We do have a competitive advantage. We do have a coverage there. Our brand has been very prominent in India. The brand awareness is bringing probably the highest amount of money transfer companies there. So, I think it will come back depending on how fast, I can't say that, but it's coming. I can see day-by-day improvement.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "And the great thing about India is that we have fantastic retail coverage. And we also have fantastic account coverage. We pay out into most accounts in India. So...", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "...the infrastructure is right to improve there.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thanks very much.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Darrin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hello, Bryan.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. How are you doing?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Good. How are you, Bryan?", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I'm all right, I'm all right. Just wanted to ask about the U.S.-originated transactions. It was up 4%, and then I think that was down from 8% last year in fiscal year 2016, and it was pretty consistent around that 8% last year. So, just trying to figure out, was that directly a result of the strengthening Mexico peso and anything else in there that caused a little bit of a deceleration from the rate that we saw all through the fiscal year 2016?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, it's \u2013 U.S. to Mexico, our DMT business is also a part of that number, so DMT was softer in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. And so, those two things combined did that, but we still \u2013 as you said, we still had good growth in North America as well as the U.S., and so overall still tracking well but softer than what we saw in the fourth quarter and prior quarters.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then, just on the tax rate, for the quarter, that came in higher. Was that something that you guys knew that was going to happen or is that something that popped-up during the quarter? And then you talked a little bit about cadence throughout the year. It sounds like the fourth quarter, will it basically be like a zero tax rate or...", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "...what do you think about the fourth quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, we had planned on \u2013 obviously our outlook for the full year has not changed, so 11% and then 13% adjusted. So, we had planned on these activities for the year. The timing in the first quarter was less under our control, I would say. And so, we're going to get those same benefits the rest of this year, because we had planned on it. We've basically accelerated into Q1.", "And then, the second and third quarters should be closer to our full year average tax rate. And the fourth quarter, I would expect to be substantially lower because we have a number of different discrete benefits that we had already planned on, plus this timing benefit. So, it should be substantially lower than you'll see for even the second and third quarter as we go into the fourth quarter.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Just last question for me on the Western Union Business Solutions. It sounds like there was a termination of a partner contract. Is there a bigger impact in that going forward or is the decrease in 3% constant currency about the right number we should expect for fiscal year 2017? Thanks so much.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Well, the XE.com customer is something we spoke about last year. We knew that we were going to lose it at the end of last year, which is what happened. And so we're going to see that grow over impact at least through the first three quarters of this year, a little bit in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a three-point impact from that as we move through, but our goal is to grow the business faster than what we achieved in the first quarter. That's not an acceptable growth level for us. And we're doing a number of good things in that business where we want to drive better growth. So I would not model minus 3% in that business, that's not our objective. Our objective is to grow better than that.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, it's also different performance. Europe has been growing good, but Latin America \u2013 sorry, North America and Asia-Pacific has been slower there. It's something that we're focused on that, should be better growth. And I think we have also some focus areas with some management changes, and really how we can drive the sales there better. And I think we will try to get that better, but we are not pleased with the current (33:07) performance...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "...and I think it should be better.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks for the color.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon, and thanks for taking...", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Jim.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the C2B revenue. I think you talked about an impact in Argentina, and maybe a couple other factors. But I think that growth in that segment was as high as I see it going back several years. So, is that a one-time impact? Is that a sustainable benefit? And maybe just talk about what you're seeing in that business maybe for the remainder of the year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. The C2B business has been growing in the low double-digit range for quite a long time now, the last several years. And what we saw in the quarter, we also had good reported growth in that business of 8%, and that's because Argentina didn't devalue as much as we had expected. But we continue to see really good growth opportunities for that business. It's being driven by a couple of different things, the Argentina cash walk-in business where consumers are paying bills at retail locations, and then our electronic payments business here in the U.S. And then that's being offset a little bit by U.S. cash walk-in. So, the growth profile of that business continues to be very strong, and we continue to add to the portfolio. And we're very excited about the opportunities in that business.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I think, in some area, we are focused also about the future. One of our strategic initiative is that how we can move better not only C2C transaction or the C2B transaction cross-border, cross-currency. And we see some signs in the U.S., that business is performing very well, our Speedpay business, electronic business and our Argentina business. Can we take that also to other countries? Can we do cross-border payments? That's something with our new organization, WU Way, that's something that we're long-term concentrated on that that we can have a long-term growth there. So we are excited.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good to hear. And then, maybe as a follow-up really on related topic, related to the kind of changing international owners to be talked about to adopt to PSP2. Can you maybe talk about broad strokes of what changes in ownership were actually or have been made and will be made?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And whether that has any kind of longer-term impact on the tax structure?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. No, it's a longer-term impact on the tax structure. The activity relates specially to our Business Solutions business and the licensing requirements that are coming next year in Europe related to some of the products that we sell \u2013 the derivatives products that we sell. So, we had to make some changes. As you know \u2013 as you may know, we own a bank in Austria. And so, we've combined or we're going to be combining those organizations to provide the right type of licensing structure ultimately. So that's the underlying activity that we're driving at.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good evening.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Kartik Mehta.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hi. You've talked in the past and even on this call about mobile and the utilization, and it seems to be increasing. And I'm wondering, obviously there is a consumer convenience component to it, but what other benefits does Western Union get, if any, from greater mobile utilization?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I think that's one of our biggest \u2013 strong growth where it's coming from. It's one of our biggest strategic initiatives and the team is doing a great job. So, let me start with saying that we have the fundamentals. We can send money to 200 countries, the others can't like we can do it. We can drop money in an account and in a location. We have almost billions of accounts, almost 3 billion accounts or like over 2 billion accounts, I don't know. Currently it's over 2.5 billion accounts, I believe, yeah.", "And then, we have about over half-a-million locations. So, this combination, sending money from a mobile anytime, anywhere, 24/7, has been seen by the customers extremely well. Now, the customer has to register. Once the customer use it once, they really want to use it more often. The other thing what we say is to get different customer segment. They're probably younger generation, they do have accounts, they do use their credit cards or their accounts to fund the transaction, and we see good growth here.", "So, we saw very good growth in the U.S. but we also expanded, we have now 14 countries on our online westernunion.com and 18 on mobile app. If you can use your mobile app in the U.S. with your English language, or with \u2013 you're sending that. But in Germany, we have a German; in France, we have a France app. We have really adapted all this to local environment our apps and the customers are using that, and it's going to continue.", "The other thing is also, I'm excited, we started not only send money to an account, not only to a location, but also through a mobile wallet. And so, combining mobile wallet to mobile with mobile to mobile is also something that we're excited about that.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And Raj, I know you talked about compliance cost this year maybe being at the higher end of guidance. But as you look at those costs, do you think there is an opportunity to automate or consolidate so that they reduce as \u2013 maybe in 2018 and beyond?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Go ahead.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize how we spend there. And over time, the composition of how we spent that money has changed, right? And as we've completed many of the Southwest Border requirements, that spending has gotten less over the last couple of years, but it's migrated to other programs. So, we're always putting technology in place and we want to automate those things. Our first priority this year really is to address the requirements that we have under the settlement agreements, and that's the reason for the higher spend this year. And we'll look to stabilize as much as we can over time.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "One thing, Kartik, I just want to mention that also. I see that as an investment as a competitive advantage. And it really gives us the capability and operate in 200 countries, work with regulators, flows, adapting to changes very fast. We have a team there, about 2,000-plus people working on the compliance, but not only them also our agents work with \u2013 close with our compliance teams. So I see that as a competitive advantage. It's a barrier of entry for many, but we have it here. And we're going to continue to advance that compliance activities. That doesn't mean that we are not looking being more efficient, but it's an competitive advantage I believe.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from our Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. How are you?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Good.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Good, good.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "So, my first question is on Western Union Business Solutions. And I've always had the view, I think you guys have mentioned this in the past too that as the economy improves that the performance of this business unit should improve, and even absent the XE contract loss, it just seems to be a little bit sluggish in terms of \u2013 if there is a lack of growth. Does it need more investment? I mean, do you need a better product? I'm trying to understand what is it that gets this going. And then, sort of a sub-question is, any views on \u2013 you've seen some acquisitions in the B2B space just in the last week, one by Vantiv and one by FLEETCOR, any thoughts on that space?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Well, Ashwin, I believe that the Western Union Business Solutions should have a better performance than we reported in Q1, I agree on that with you. I think, the global economic environment, when that improves, when more export-import connection happens, especially on the small and mid-sized business entities, that will improve given how linked that sending money and receiving money is with importer and exporter.", "Besides that, I don't believe that we need a significant investment there to improve our performance. It's more really a focus on the sales getting new customers, where its liking is that I understand more is on the foreign trade part \u2013 foreign exchange trade part on the hedges and on the forwards. We have some performance issue. However, the payments part, like the invested (42:11) payments, like NGO payments is doing very well.", "How you pay your builds or cross-border builds during (42:18) performance very well. However, on the trading part, foreign exchange trading part, we do need some more focus here. And I know the team is doing a little \u2013 putting also Wu Way activities around that's looking really how we can improve the part generally, this part has to improve, and I believe that over time it will improve.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got it. And then, I want to go back to sort of the commentary around pricing being stable. I just want to confirm that when you top-up stable pricing, it is still that you can offset the unit fees or the transaction fees with increasing FX spread. And I know you're not going to provide this information in the future. But to what extent can you actually increase FX spread before sort of clients start pushing back on that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "It's all about mix. You know our business very well, Ashwin, depending on the corridor. We do have corridors, which is zero FX. We do have corridors, which are higher FX, zero fees. We do have corridors where there's both are that. It's really like an airline management where you fly from one destination to another destination, which seats you for use, and that's exactly what we are doing with our teams. I think, in the portfolio management, the team is impressive. It's really looking at every corridor, understanding the customer needs on FX side.", "I believe there is room. We can be even better there, having the right balance between foreign exchange and fees, but our business model is built mostly on fee and less on FX. But there is, I believe, opportunity to see the customer need and go after that. That keeps the \u2013 the mix also keeps the flexibility as to keeping the pricing stable. And as I mentioned earlier, our prices are higher than the competition, but the market and the customer feel comfortable with the prices. And the 2% constant currency growth is definitely something that are also transaction growth reflects that.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "And Ashwin, in some markets, customers are hyper-sensitive to fees or FX, and so it really just depends on that overall mix in what the competitor set has. So it's not one formula for any particular market.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. They're just managing country-by-country or corridor-by-corridor?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Corridor-by-corridor more, Ashwin.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question will come from John Davis of Stifel.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Raj, I wonder maybe you could give us an update on the amount of cash in the U.S. versus abroad currently. And then, maybe on a more normalized run rate of $1 billion, excluding all the one-time items, how much of that cash flow is generated in the U.S. versus abroad? Just trying to get a handle, if we do get tax reform, what kind of impact it could have on your tax rate?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, our cash balance was higher at the end of the first quarter than we've had for some time. It was higher than the end of the year, because we did raise some debt in the first quarter. We also issued some term debt as well as some commercial paper. And that's in anticipation of making these final payments for the legal settlements. So that's why you see a higher level of cash. By the end of the year, we should be at a lower level of cash.", "We currently have about half of the cash at the end of the first quarter U.S.-based, and the rest of it's abroad. On an ongoing basis, we generate about 75% or so of our cash flow outside the U.S. And that includes any repatriation that we may do back to the U.S., normal repatriation. So, if we were to get comprehensive tax reform, that could potentially alleviate any future issues of repatriation of foreign profit, which should be a good thing for us.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on WU Connect, obviously the Facebook announcement, but any kind of update there? I know it's still early days, but I just haven't heard about it in a while. I'm just kind of curious, kind of thoughts or any updates?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, we're excited about the Facebook announcement and the potential there. It's a great product. Our customers really don't have to leave the messenger environment to do a transaction, but for us it's just another channel to allow customers to do a transaction with us, right. Whether it's Viber or WeChat or Facebook, we just want to provide as many avenues as possible for customers to be able to do a transaction with us. On Facebook specifically, whether they come through Facebook or whether they come to us directly on wu.com, we're really indifferent because the economics of that transaction are about the same for us. So, we'll see \u2013 it's early stages, but we'll see how that kind of transpires.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Is the customer convenient? I did some transactions, unbelievable. You would not be \u2013 leaving the messenger and you do transaction, you continue to use the messenger, so it's really combining here and dropping money in minutes worldwide to 200 countries, 500,000 locations and billions of accounts. It's quite convenient for both who are Messenger users, Facebook users, then us.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good evening. Will you need to raise more debt to fund the settlement payments or is the debt activity that you did here in the first quarter pretty much all that you're paying for the full year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. We've raised the debt in the first quarter to make the payments in the second quarter \u2013 first and second quarter. So, that's why you see an elevated level of debt. The only other piece that we have there is, we have a refinancing to do of another $500 million maturity at the end of this year. So, we will likely pre-finance that before the December maturity. So you'll see potentially some higher levels of debt. But by the end of the year, we should be at about where we were for the first quarter, assuming nothing else changes.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then, could you give us the year-over-year margin impacts from higher compliance costs in the first quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Well, last year, we spent \u2013 we are at 3.6% of revenues in the first quarter. And in the first quarter this year, we're at 3.7%. So it's not a dramatic difference. And for the full year, I would expect this to be at the higher end of our 3.5% to 4% range. And in the last couple of years, we've been closer to 3.5%.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Understood. And then, last one from me. When you \u2013 as you look forward into the timing of the WU Way cost savings, I understood though increase as you go through the year, but would you be close to full run rate by the fourth quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "I would expect to be at a more full run rate, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities there. So, right now, we plan for about $20 million this year, and then incrementally $25 million next year, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities for savings.", "David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Bob.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Just on the stock buybacks, how much capital do you expect to use this year? And then, any change to your policies and share buybacks should capital return over the next couple of years?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, Bob, we have $1.2 billion left on our share repurchase authorization, and that's good through 2019. We bought $225 million in the first quarter. We haven't given an exact number for this year. But as we gave our original outlook earlier this year, we were just planning on buying irritably through the course of the next three years. And if you look at our capital return, our policies really haven't changed a lot. We've continued to give a lot of cash back through dividends. And that's \u2013 our dividend payout now is over 40%, our yield is 3.5%. And so that's the key important part. We returned more than $300 million a year in just dividends. And then, we use our excess cash flow to really buyback the stock to the extent that we're not investing in other places.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, on wu.com, the growth rate has been relatively steady over the last year, in the high-20%s. What are your thoughts on being able to maintain that growth rate over the next few years?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I think, it has been obviously a great growth rate, and we believe that we are absolutely growing faster than the competition, and the team is executing very well. Don't forget, I mean, I said we are \u2013 just launched 40 countries, it's only 40 countries to send money to 200 countries. And the new countries will generate until they come really on a revenue generating mode, it will even be better, and then we want to be in 200 countries to send 200 countries, like our agent network.", "And so that's something the team is focused. That's something that we are extremely optimistic that our digital expansion will continue. And combining digital with retail, it's the secret sauce, different customer use cases. So, I'm quite optimistic, and the teams are also optimistic on that.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "And those customers, what is it still over 80% that are new to Western Union?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Still 80% of the customers didn't use the recent \u2013 retail money transferred for the last...", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "For the last couple of years.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "...couple of years. They're still new.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Last question, Business Solutions, last night, FLEETCOR announced the acquisition of Cambridge. I believe they're a direct competitor. That business obviously has not performed the way you wanted it to perform since you've acquired the two businesses. The Cambridge they put out was growing over 20% has 40% margins. What does it take to get your business to \u2013 I mean, why are you underperforming to a competitor like that so much? And is it strategically important to own that business should you consider selling it?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "So, first of all, Western Union Business Solutions is nothing else but moving money cross-border cross-currency. It's not like total different business like a prepaid card business or something like...", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "...loan business. So it is obviously very much linked to our core, which we move cross-currency. So, it makes sense to be within the Western Union. The second thing is that, on that business, the foreign exchange part \u2013 the trading part has not been performing that well. In Europe, we had good results but some in North America and Australia has been a little bit, over the few quarters, not the performance we want to have it.", "I think it's important also to keep that business. It does has some \u2013 provides benefit for our internal working capital, and we've been extremely good on that one. But on this business, there are two big benefits which the competitor don't have. The payments part of the business, like we have the most universities. It's growing very \u2013 the student payment is one of the product, which is growing very fast, and we have other things like that.", "Utility payments is also cross-border. And the other thing is also, we do \u2013 if you recall about three quarters ago or something like that, we announced our EDGE platform, where we combine the importers and exporters in one platform and provide service for both of them. This is also something that has a future about that, so it has asset (54:48).", "Now, from the business performance, I agree from that \u2013 it could be better, and we'll focus on that. And so, it is definitely something that we are very much focused on it.", "Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "We're almost at the bottom now. We'll take one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. The final question will come from Alex Veytsman of Monness Crespi.", "Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, greetings. A quick question on the EU and CIS regions. So, the transaction growth rate was 8% year-on-year for the quarter. Could you help us break it down, if the traction is coming mostly from Western Europe or CIS? And also given that transaction growth rate has accelerated over the last several quarters, should we be expecting the same levels more or less for this region throughout 2017?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, the Europe CIS region, first of all, was quite stable till the last quarter. We had the same level of constant currency growth, 4% in both quarters. And the transaction growth lift that you saw was largely coming from the Russian market, which is at a relatively lower revenue per transaction. And so, the Russian and the Ukraine business performed quite well, but that's not necessarily going to continue for the full year. There are some other restrictions coming in those markets. So, that's really you saw the transaction lift, but the overall revenue growth was pretty consistent with last quarter.", "Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.", "Great.

We are pleased that our global diverse business continued to deliver solid performance in the second quarter. Although the external environment remained mixed around the world, our overall constant currency revenues increased 2%. Money transfer constant currency growth was driven by strong results from Latin America and solid growth from North America Outbound and Europe. The performance from these markets offset continued declines from the oil producing countries in the Middle East and Africa.", "Our digital business continue to excel with westernunion.com transactions increasing 25%. In Business Solutions revenues declined slightly in constant currency terms as low FX volatility affected business in some key markets. Our Speedpay electronic bill payments business, however, again posted good result, delivering double-digit growth in the quarter.", "From a profit perspective, our adjusted margins were strong, all the GAAP margins were affected by a legal matter accrual. We also continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and return significant cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $540 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Based on our second quarter results and our projections for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook. The GAAP EPS outlook has been moved down slightly due to the legal matter accrual.", "To summarize the quarter, I am pleased with the operating performance of the business. We are still managing through some challenges in the regulatory environment related to our prior settlement, but our compliance program remain a critical component of our cross-border capabilities and we will continue to invest in them.", "Our business performance continues to be stable and resilient, and we believe there are opportunities to accelerate growth over time. With our long-term strategies we are focusing on, digital expansion and money transfer, optimization of our retail money transfer business, expansion of our payments based business including Business Solutions and U.S. electronic bill payments and further increase in operating efficiencies. The growth trends are built on our key cross-border capabilities, including global licensing and regulatory compliance, foreign exchange and settlement system, technology and our extensive payout network.", "We believe we have a strong leadership position in digital money transfer, with westernunion.com money transfer revenue of more than $340 million last year and delivering strong growth again in this year. Over the next few years, we plan to expand well beyond the 40 countries where we have westernunion.com transaction sites today, with an emphasis on mobile, as well as increased penetration in existing markets through enhanced services and customer relationship management, account payout offerings and digital partnerships.", "In retail money transfer, we believe there are opportunities to increase customer retention by focusing on improving the customer experience and CRM processes. I just returned from Australia where we have introduced an example of improving customer experience by combining digital with retail through an agreement with BP Australia. Under the agreement, our money transfer services will be enabled in over 300 BP gas stations, allowing consumers to set up transactions on the app and then pay at the counter or use kiosks at the stores. This service will create convenience for consumers by speeding up transactions and allowing them to send any time they want, given the extended opening hours of gas stations. We plan to launch similar service in other markets as well.", "Outside consumer money transfer, expanding our payments-based business is a key priority. We are working on a new go-to-market strategy with Business Solutions, leveraging digital acquisition and servicing to our EDGE platform. We're also applying more resources to our specialized payments business, which serves verticals such as financial institutions and universities, and have been good performance within Business Solutions.", "We recently published new industry research on the significant financial and human resource cost faced by universities when managing payments from international students. However, our GlobalPay for Students platform was developed to improve the way universities reconcile, refund, and track international payments, and it also provides a mobile-first interface for the students. With our Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payment business, we are focused on adding more billers and additional features and services for consumers and billers.", "Finally, further increasing our operating efficiencies is an important element of our long-term success. WU Way initiatives are intended to produce near and long-term efficiencies, as well as aid growth to improve customer retention and aid in management processes. This year, we have changed our organizational design, begun implementation of lean management techniques in our operating centers, progressed the optimization of our technology footprint, and initiated pilot programs to drive improvements in customer experience and other areas. Although sample size are small at this stage, we are seeing good results from many of our pilot programs.", "We are experiencing significant productivity gains in our agent implementation pilots. We are also getting good early test results on using digital self-service and other tools to reduce customer touch points and call center times on transactions that require initial need to action. We will keep you updated on our strategic efforts, and provide the additional WU Way metrics and progress points as they develop.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the second quarter results and our full-year outlook in more detail.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Hikmet. Second quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion were flat compared to the prior-year period, or increased 2% on a constant currency basis. The impacts of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced second quarter revenue by approximately $29 million compared to the prior year. In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues decreased 1% in the quarter or increased 1% constant currency. Transactions grew 3%, driven by strong growth in westernunion.com.", "Total C2C cross-border principal increased 1%, or 2% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 3%, or 2% in constant currency terms. The spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 4 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter, while pricing was flat compared to the prior-year period.", "Turning to the regional results for the quarter. I will be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regions' results. North America delivered good growth again in the quarter, with revenue increasing 3% on a reported and constant currency basis, while transactions grew 4%. Strong U.S. outbound was driven by sends to Latin American countries, while U.S. to Mexico and domestic money transfer in the U.S. were softer than the first quarter.", "Market growth to Mexico appears to have slowed, which may be tied to the strength of the Mexican peso, and our U.S. domestic revenues are being impacted by previously implemented price reductions.", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 2%, or increased 2% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. Revenue growth in the region was led by France, while transaction growth continue to benefit from increases in Russia.", "In the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region, revenue declined 12%, or 11% constant currency, and transactions were down 10%, as oil prices continued to negatively affect key send markets. Total inbound business to India was down approximately 15% in the quarter, an improvement compared to the 20% decline in the first quarter, and the decline was largely attributable to softness in the Middle East send markets. In the APAC region, revenue was down 4%, or 2% constant currency, while transactions decreased 1%.", "The Latin America and Caribbean region continued to deliver very strong results, led by Argentina and several other markets. Revenue grew 21% in the region, or 22% constant currency, while transactions grew 16%.", "Westernunion.com C2C revenue delivered strong performance again in the quarter, with revenue increasing 21% or 23% constant currency, on 25% transaction growth. Westernunion.com represented 9% of total C2C revenue in the quarter.", "Business Solutions revenues declined 4% or decreased 1% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of the XE.com business. Revenues benefited from good growth in key verticals such as financial institutions, universities and NGOs, but this was offset by continued decline in sales with hedging products, partially due to the lower FX volatility in key markets.", "Our bill payments revenues are now reported in other, rather than a separate C2B segment due to recent organizational changes that resulted in a split of executive leadership responsibility for these businesses. The bill payments businesses represented over 85% of other revenues in the quarter, with the remainder primarily comprised of our retail money order and retail FX businesses.", "The largest component of other is our Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments business, which had revenues of over $320 million in 2016. Overall, other revenues increased 9% in the second quarter or 12% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by Speedpay in the U.S. and the Pago Facil walk-in bill payments business in Argentina.", "Turning to margins and profitability. The consolidated GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was 15.6%, which compared to 18.9% in the prior year period. The decline in GAAP operating margin was due to a $49 million accrual towards a possible resolution with a state regulator. The matter covers the same facts set forth in the company's agreement with the federal government announced in January concerning the company's anti-money laundering programs over the 2004 through 2012 period. Last week, the regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, informed the company that those facts give it basis to take additional enforcement action, the resolution of which would involve a payment to the regulator. As the matter is still under negotiation, we refer you to our Form 10-Q for further information.", "Adjusted operating margin of 21.7% in the quarter compared to 20.2% in the prior year period. The adjusted margin increase was primarily due to benefits from the timing of marketing spending and lower commission expense. Adjusted metrics exclude WU Way expenses in both the current and prior year, expenses related to the settlement with federal and state governments in the prior year, and the legal matter accrual in the current year.", "WU Way expenses were $35 million in the current quarter and $2 million in the prior-year period. Expenses related to the settlement totaled $15 million in the prior-year period. We have recorded approximately $1 million of savings from the WU Way initiatives in the quarter and continue to expect approximately $20 million of savings for the full year.", "Foreign exchange hedges in the second quarter produced a benefit of $7 million, compared to a benefit of $11 million in the second quarter of 2016. For the full year, we now expect approximately $10 million in hedge benefits, which is down from our previous expectation of approximately $25 million due to the strengthening of the euro and other key currencies. Although hedge benefits declined with the strengthening of foreign currency, translation benefits on unhedged positions more than offset these reduced benefits. Consequently for the full year, we expect the net currency impact on profit to be slightly less than our previous outlook.", "In the quarter, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $7 million compared to the prior year. Compliance expense was 3.2% of revenue for the second quarter as we received some benefit from early completion of the Southwest Border agreement in the U.S. In June, it was announced that we successfully completed all monitor recommendations related to this agreement which was signed in 2010 with the State of Arizona.", "Through two quarters, compliance expense was at 3.5% and we now expect the full-year expense to be slightly lower than we previously thought, although still in the 3.5% to 4% range.

Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 which compares to adjusted EPS of $0.44 in the second quarter of last year. The C2C margin was 24.8%, up from 23% in the prior-year period. The margin increase was primarily due to benefits from the timing of marketing spending and lower commission expense.", "Business Solutions operating profit margin was 5.5% in the quarter compared to 5.2% in the prior-year period, as lower depreciation and amortization was partially offset by higher technology expense. Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior-year period. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 16.6%, which compares to 18.2% in the second quarter of 2016 with the decline primarily caused by higher technology expense.", "Operating margin for the businesses in other was 12.1% in the quarter compared to 11.3% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement was driven by technology efficiencies and revenue growth, which were partially offset by higher bank fees in U.S. electronics bill pay.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities was a usage of $24 million year-to-date, which includes $591 million of payments related to the settlement with the federal and state government announced in January and approximately $39 million of WU Way-related payments. Excluding these items, cash flow from operating activities was $606 million in the first half of the year. Capital expenditures were $49 million in the second quarter.

We are increasing our outlooks for GAAP revenue and adjusted earnings per share, while we are decreasing our outlooks for GAAP operating margin and earnings per share due to the legal matter accrual. We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be in the range of flat to a low single-digit increase, an improvement from the previous outlook of flat to a low single-digit decline due to the strengthening of key foreign currencies.", "Given some favorable expense trends, the weaker U.S. dollar, and a slightly lower expected tax rates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.72 to $1.80, up from $1.63 to $1.75 previously. The GAAP earnings per share outlook has been decreased to a range of $1.46 to $1.56 compared to $1.48 to $1.60 in the prior outlook, due to the $0.10 impact of the legal matter accrual.", "Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.08 negative impact from foreign exchange, compared to the prior year, down slightly from our previous projection of a $0.09 negative impact. The strengthening of foreign currencies has a larger impact on revenue than earnings in the short-term due to the neutralizing impact of our existing hedges.", "So, to summarize, we delivered solid business performance in the second quarter, our balance sheet and returns of cash to shareholders remain strong, and we have increased our adjusted EPS outlook for the full year.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just two quick questions on the regional trends in both the U.S. to Mexico corridor, you talked about potential peso movements maybe contributing to the slowness of that business. Can you maybe kind of expand on what you think might be going on there if anything beyond that? And then secondly, on the EU and CIS, I think that's slowed again a little bit against relatively easy comp last year. So I'm just wondering if there's any specific trends to call out within Europe.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hey, Jim. Thank you for the question. So if you look at the U.S. Mexico business, I think the growth has been very strong the last quarters, actually over several quarters. As you know, we are doing better than the markets there, and we are quite competitive. I believe the strength in the Mexico has contributed of the slowness of the corridor a little bit, still strong growth but still contributed that. I don't see, from today's point of view, there's other impact on this corridor. Don't forget that we have a solid business there, or we have about 30,000 locations, recently, we announced also OXXO locations there. So I believe that the business has been impacted mainly of our strength in peso there. So we don't see different trends than from today's point of view. Our pricing has been very competitive. We see good trends there. So that's it.", "On Europe, I think we are pleased with our growth there, right. I mean, France has been doing very well, other European Union countries holding pretty well. Russia showed good transaction growth. As you recall that \u2013 especially Russia to Ukraine has been a good corridor for us. There are some regulatory challenges for the competition, and also some political and regulatory issues there, but I think we've been performing there also well.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. And then, Jim, just a slight tick-down in growth in Europe and CIS. Russia was strong in terms of transaction growth in the quarter, but it was slightly softer than it was in the first quarter.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "That's helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe one for you, Raj. In terms of the compliance outlook, it's good to see that you kind of reined towards the lower end of that 3.5% to 4% range. I mean, is that indeed your expectation for the full year as coming at the low end of that range and can you maybe comment on the sustainability of kind of under-running that range as we head into 2018?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, we initially gave an outlook on May 2 of being at the high end of the range. We believe we'll be in the range now. I can't tell you specifically whether we'll be at the low end of that range or not. But obviously, we try to do things as efficiently as we can, but still making sure that we meet all of our objectives. The Southwest Border helped us in the second quarter, and that's what's really helping us bring it down. And as we look at next year, I think it's a little bit early. But you can look at the trend for the last two or three years, it's been in that 3.5% to 4% range. So we feel good about where it is today, and we continue to invest in that area to create the advantage long-term.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Jim.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Kartik.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hey. How are you? Good afternoon. I just wanted to maybe ask a little bit more on the compliance cost. I know in the past we've talked about the real ability to drive down those costs would be, try to automate some of those processes. And I'm wondering, now that you've had this ongoing for a little while, is it possible to automate some of those processes to drive down costs, or will this stay a very people-intensive ballpark, and so the expenses will kind of stay where they are?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I would just say, Kartik, that on the compliance cost run, there is a large portion that's fixed in nature, but there's also a piece that's variable. And obviously, we want to reduce the fixed cost as much as we can, with more technology enhancements. That takes some time for us to put those in. Obviously, we've been putting in technology solutions and we're trying to optimize all of our processes. As you know, we also have the WU Way programs, where we're trying to put lean management in our operating centers around the world. We have a lot of our compliance people sitting in these operating centers. So obviously, the goal is making sure that we do everything we need to do, but then we're going to try to be as efficient as we can be. And that's why, even though we've had good transaction growth over the last few years, we've been able to maintain that range of 3.5% to 4%, because we want to look for efficiencies along the way. So that's absolutely a part of our focus, to keep optimizing there.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And then, Raj, if you look at the operating margins for the C2C business, I realize you benefit a little bit from maybe expense timing this quarter. As you look out, what do you think the sustainability of margins is in that business?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, the margin \u2013 and I can't give you a forecast, Kartik, but I would say that a lot of the WU Way efficiencies and the programs that we're trying to drive efficiencies through will help margins in the consumer business. That's where a lot of our operational activities are. And so certainly, that's where we want to try to find efficiencies. And I think there's opportunity there. As we improve the customer experience and as we reduce the touch points that customers have, or even agents, that's what gives us the ability to take some cost out of that business.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "The mix helps us also a little bit, Kartik. Dropping money on an account helps there also. We see a very strong growth there. Sending money from dot-com to an account, that helps a little bit. But the dot-com success is also very much linked to the cash payout. So the combination of account payout and cash payout is definitely very competitive on the market.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Kartik.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good steady results here. Just, I guess, following up on Kartik's question on margin. This quarter obviously came in very, very strong. I get that some of it was timing of marketing, but is the commission piece permanent? Just trying to understand what's going to drive the step back down in margin in the second half versus the second quarter, I suppose.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. There is some timing of expenses in the first half. So marketing is going to be higher in the second half, so we have plans to put our programs in place there. We have a slightly higher compliance expense than we experienced in the first half, just given the benefit we got in the second quarter. And then, from a currency standpoint, we \u2013 from an absolute standpoint, it helps us both from top line and bottom line. Margins are somewhat negatively impacted, just because of the hedge position that we have, which mitigates the impact on profits. And then we'll also get some WU Way savings and efficiencies, which we've also taken into account. So, assuming we spend all of the money that we have planned, then we would expect margins to be slightly lower, but obviously we're going to try to do things as efficiently as we can.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then on the commissions?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I think I can take that, Raj.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Look, we are obviously looking also on the commission side. On the send side, obviously, the mix helps us a lot Tien-Tsin, as you know, if you send money or receive money on an account or electronically, it's different. You do have credit card cost or bank fees on the send side, on the dot-com business. But still, you don't have the send commissions. And obviously, the mix is one that helps us, and we do have WU Way programs, how we will optimize our commissions based on different prices, different brands, different corridors. I think the flexibility on the new WU Way approach, and adapting our technology to the new kind of corridor specific commissions helps us also, long-term, bring the commissions down.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. If I could ask just a quick follow-up then, just on the westernunion.com piece. You mentioned the 40 countries. Is there a good backlog or a pipeline of additional countries to rollout this year Hikmet, or Raj?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I think, obviously, our focus is expanding our dot-com. I wish I could be as soon as possibly 200 countries, right, like my retail money transfer business. On the 40 send countries, 20 of them are on mobile app already, 40 are online. And there is a roadmap to add additional countries. For competitive reasons, I don't want to tell which countries we're going to launch, but we will launch countries very soon, new countries and you're going to see new announcement and the team is very much focused.", "As you know, it's not an easy to job. You see it from the competitors there sticking with one or two countries, but you have to get the regulatory environment, you have to get the compliance environment, you have to get the digital environment and that takes time to launch a country and you have to have the ethnic marketing in this country. So it takes time, but 40 outbound country is definitely something.", "And on the growth, on the westernunion.com, the team is doing very well \u2013 pretty good on the existing countries. They are much focused on the customer experience like the U.S. We see the customers who use dot-com come more often to us than they use it in retail. On the new countries, obviously it's all about new awareness and growth. And once the growth also kicks in, in the new countries, I believe that there is an opportunity to grow faster on dot-com.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. Great. Thanks for the update. Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Tien-Tsin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks, guys. I just want to start off...", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Darrin.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Just a first question is back to WU Way initiatives for a moment. Just want to make sure if that's really trending well and as in plan? Is there any expectation you'd have to change the numbers around that that you gave us in the beginning of the year? And again, how to revisit and think about into next year? Any updates on that first.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, Darrin, we're confident of our outlook there, both on the \u2013 we plan to spend about $100 million. That hasn't changed, that's approximately $100 million, and we've already spent about $50 million year-to-date. We had always planned on getting the majority of our efficiencies in the second half of the year, and that continues to be the plan. We've taken some severance actions. We've started our technology footprint consolidation. So, those things will translate into benefits as we go into the third and fourth quarter. So, that's still the expectation.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I feel also very confident, Darrin, on that. So, the team is really starting to implement the lean management techniques. As you know, it's all about lean management techniques having different efficiencies. We started having two significant projects, which is one is the agent implementation program, the second one is the digital self-service program for consumers. That's immediately brought us on the test phase, the reports of $1 million and we have a roadmap to get to the $20 million. So, I feel quite confident on that.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just I guess a quick follow-up on the digital side. I mean, I think it was a little bit slower than it was last quarter. It's still going very well, obviously, relatively speaking, over 20% growth. But the deceleration, I think, just a small amount, was that just tougher compares? I guess compares get a lot tougher in the second half of the year against, what, 30%-type growth last year, second half. And I guess I just want to make sure there's nothing competitively going on, I know you touched on that briefly before at another question, nothing around the industry. It's really just \u2013 is it just tough comps or \u2013 and then is the additional corridors, I think you just mentioned in answering another question, just enough to drive \u2013 to hold up that growth rate for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, that's a long question. Let me try to answer that question. So, first of all, we are extremely pleased with the dot-com numbers. And compared with the competition, our business on 2016 was $340 million. And 2017, we will be \u2013 if you take that growth rate, we will be over $400 million. It's far bigger than any competition on the market. So, the growth rates are extremely good and that's the base where we are growing. We are growing really from a very strong base on the dot-com business.", "The second thing is that, the growth is currently coming mainly from the existing markets with the customer experience. As I mentioned earlier to Tien-Tsin is that, new markets \u2013 opening new markets will help us once that customer experience also kicks in there, we can see already in European \u2013 some European Union countries strong growth here. The customers are repeating and using us. So I'm pretty much focused on that and I feel comfortable with \u2013 it has been a little bit slowdown. The slowdown came a little bit by the U.S. domestic and U.S. business \u2013 domestic money transfer business on the dot-com, but international for cross-border, the growth rates are impressive.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "And Darrin, the wu.com business has been growing in the mid 20% range for the last few years and that's the rate it continues to grow at. So we're very pleased with the overall result. Does that make any sense?", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. No, that's helpful, guys. Thanks very much.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on those operating margins. I was just hoping maybe you could, Raj, quantify the marketing impact that was pushed out and just curious, was that region and was it unexpected or is this just a something that popped up that's surprised you guys in the quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "No, we have marketing plans that we layout at the beginning of the year and the marketing level of spending will vary from quarter to quarter, but we have a number of programs that are lined up particularly in our digital business to drive the growth there. So nothing really that unusual there. That is certainly the biggest driver. We haven't quantified it, but it's certainly the biggest driver.", "Compliance is a little bit higher and then FX is having a little bit of a negative impact. We're just a little bit counterintuitive, even though we're getting absolute benefits from revenues and profit, the profit impact is not as much and so it's slightly negative to margins. And then certainly have helped from the WU Way savings. But I mean those are main factors Bryan, there are a lot of other puts and takes in that for the rest of the year, but those are the key items.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then, Hikmet, on those lower commissions, it sounded like that would continue from some of the mix shift change.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, if you look at over the, I would say, at the last two years, Raj, right, we've been quite good on commissions, more effective over the last two years. If we follow the trend, it should be getting better with the mix and also with the negotiations and we still want to have a win-win situation because good \u2013 if an agent makes good money, we'll have a better customer service also. So it's a balance here. And so \u2013 but we do see through the mix and that trend, if you look at the commission trends over the last two to three years, we've been doing a good job and that trend should continue.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just last question for me, how has the retention rate been of your exclusive agent relationships? My understanding is you recently lost some exclusive relationships in India. I don't know if you can maybe help us understand that.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure. Our exclusive agent, especially on the send side has been exclusive to top 40 agents for the last 20 years, and that has not changed. And, Bryan, you know our business model very well. Once it's in Western Union location or in the transaction system, it stays in the transaction system and that's the most important one. So our agents on the send side has been exclusive...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "They are mostly exclusive on the send side.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Exclusive on the last \u2013 we have exclusive agreement for 20 years. So on the India side, obviously, we have 110,000 locations and our millions of accounts in \u2013 hundred millions of accounts in India. And our business is very much \u2013 one of the strong business growing to India is sending westernunion.com to an account. And that has been growing very fast over the years and that's the success story on that. That drives also the westernunion.com growth actually. And so on the exclusivity, I would say that, we like exclusive agent as everyone would like it, right. But on the send side, we are feeling quite comfortable with our exclusive partnerships.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, Bryan, India has been a non-exclusive market for years and almost all of our locations there have been non-exclusive for some time.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Right.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for the color guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks. Thanks, Bryan.", "Operator", "The next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. Thank you. It's James at Susquehanna. I just want to ask a couple of questions. Raj, I think in your prepared remarks, you suggested that the Southwest Border agreement would have a constructive impact on compliance cost. I was trying to understand the mechanics of that (39:01) technical? And then also if you \u2013 are we closer to the end and the middle in terms of the Gulf states? Where do you see the oil-rich countries when you project forward? Do you think that we're potentially going to see a recovery here at some point? Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure. On the Southwest Border, James, the benefit we got was largely in the second quarter. Obviously, we've been spending to put those programs in place for the last few years, and we sort of did the last piece of it in the second quarter and completed that. So, that's why you saw the compliance costing only 3.2% of revenues, which is lower than the run rate trend that we've had around 3.5%. So, that's really what I would look at as the benefits.", "That's not necessarily going to repeat itself as we go forward because we've sort of just spent less than we thought and now we're going to move on. Our programs do continue to ramp up the rest of this year as we spend on the Joint Settlement Agreement requirements that we signed in January. And so that's why we've got an outlook of 3.5% to 4%. And you heard the earlier discussion, but our goal is to try to do that as efficiently as we can.", "With respect to the Gulf states, assuming there's a stable environment there, and that's been quite volatile over the last couple of years, we should start to see some benefit in the second half of the year as we anniversary some of the bigger declines. The UAE and Saudi Arabia only began to decline in the second half of last year. So, we'll see how that progresses this half. And then India, which was a key part of that also, the demonetization began in November of last year. So, that'll be towards the end of the fourth quarter. But as we progress through the second half, we should start to see some benefits. Again, that assumes a stable environment there.", "James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, Hikmet. Hi, Raj.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey. So the first question is actually with the C2B restructuring and including it in other. Is there a financial or cash flow benefit from that action? And then similar to the C2B restructuring, are you looking at other areas of the overall business? For example, I think compared to the investment put in \u2013 invested in the Business Solutions, the results there have been poor for years. So just trying to figure out financial impact from broader restructuring that was put in our models.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Ashwin, the reporting change is really just that, it's a reporting change. We have some internal restructuring we have done where we've split responsibilities of the electronic businesses and the retail bill payments businesses. And so, they're being managed internally by different leaders and so they're not large enough on their own to report as a separate segment. So we've put them into other which, again, other is largely the bill payments businesses still, it's 85%, or more than 85% of the revenues, and electronic bill payments business here in the U.S. which is called Speedpay, continues to drive the results, along with the Argentina business. Any efficiencies that we get from that would be part of our WU Way programs and the efficiencies that we're showing, mostly in the second half of the year. So, I don't know if that addresses your question, Ashwin, but that's really how we've thought about it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Well, we could take it up offline. The other one is, when I look at constant currency revenue growth for C2C, it seems to have decelerated sequentially actually for each of the segments that you measure. And if I adjust out westernunion.com growth, that traditional agent side seems to be like down 1 to 2%. So, I guess the question really is, I mean this late in the cycle, one would obviously expect better growth. What are the things that you can do? Have you contemplated either pricing changes to boot up traffic, or what can you do to get out of this low-single digit decline type of event? (43:30)", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yes. I don't think it's \u2013 it's not a pricing question, Ashwin. Yeah, we had a little bit of a tick down. I mean we're talking about rounding up versus rounding down in terms of the overall growth. I think largely, the trends continue to be as we expected. In any given quarter, you're going to have a little bit of a variation there, but as you look at the various businesses, that's certainly the case, a little bit of a change in regions here and there, but generally pretty good. I mean the U.S. to Mexico, U.S. DMT, are the two ones that I would probably call out, and then Middle East continues to decline, but that's for other reasons. So we should start to see, as we just talked about, we should start to see some grow-over benefits in some areas in the second half.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. That's on the short term. On a long-term basis, obviously, how do we get out of that, obviously, as I said in the (44:23), our focus is on digital. Digital on the consumer money transfer, digital is \u2013 also on the payments business. I think these are growing very fast, and that will help us overall growth also, because don't forget, westernunion.com is growing very fast, and with $400 million over projected revenue, it's probably the largest in the market. However, it's only 9% of our revenue. And so, if that comes to a bigger number, that will definitely have a total impact on the total company results. Although other example is the Speedpay. Speedpay business is over $300 million, $350 million business...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "$320 million last year.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. So last year. And this is growing also double digit. All the digital ones that grow and having a bigger impact of the company over results by keeping the retail money transfer business stable and resilient, running the engine in a better way, I think the growth opportunities are here.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good to know. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure. Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Andrew.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Andrew.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Wanted to dig in a little bit on Speedpay, because this is a business that hasn't probably gotten a lot of airtime amidst all the talk of C2C. Can you just maybe detail specifically why that business is doing better? This is the best quarter it's had in some time, I was just looking at the historical linked quarters for the other segment you're reporting now.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure. Obviously, we are very pleased with the Speedpay results. That has to do with biller acquisition and customer experience. The existing biller has a much better customer experience. We start the program with our WU Way and with our focus with the leadership on, how do we focus on the customer experience on bill pay. And the other thing is also getting new billers, and really inviting to our platforms with solutions that are unique in the market, and that happened, Andrew, with technology upgrades.", "The team around David Thompson and the team around Jean Claude Farah did a great job to upgrade the technology platform, offering Speedpay to billers, which is unique in the market, and that growth helped. So the processing capability of Speedpay is really market leading. It's much better, and the billers are much \u2013 get their money faster, are more satisfied, and the customers can use the biller. So, that's really execution part that has been driving the growth.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Well, good to see. And then, with regard to WU Way, we're halfway through 2017 now, is there sort of a timeline for achieving the associated benefits? In other words, as we look out past 2017, will WU Way, in your view, continue to be call out expense?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "So, first of all, I would like to mention that WU Way, as you know, I said earlier, it's not only a cost saving initiative, it helps running the company more efficiently, and helps start bringing the cost savings long-term. It's not a one-time 2017 action, it's not a project, it's really not one-time initiative, it's a long-term put in all over the company with lean management.", "Now the test we put in the market, the pilots we put in the market, I'm very pleased with the results. And people are doing very efficient way of running this. I mean, you asked the question already, Speedpay. The way we operate is a different way as we did operate in the past. And that long-term cost efficiencies, that long-term efficiencies should be also allowing us to invest in the growth initiatives and really finding new growth areas, to Ashwin's question earlier, how we can have a better growth and that's the focus of WU Way. I'm very confident about this year targets. And as we get this WU Way more in our operating living experience, I will give more metrics which it will be easier to you to track on that also.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "And, Andrew, just to add to Hikmet's answer. On the $100 million that we're spending this year, we do not expect to have that same $100 million next year. So that is a cost that is going to hit this year, not next year. And then on the savings, we're still estimating about $20 million this year and an incremental $25 million next year for the WU Way savings, so the $45 million run rate.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Is that to say, Raj, that it's not a $100 million in expense or that's zero in 2018?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yes. Sure.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. We don't expect to call it in the expenses in 2018.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yes. Exactly.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "All right.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Exactly.", "Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Damian (49:41) on for Ramsey. So the question is in regards to M&A. There was some discussion late in 2015, and it's been pretty quiet since then. Are there any particular regions or capabilities that you're targeting? It sounds like online remittance has been a recent target. So is it safe to assume that future M&A would likely be targeted at similar capabilities? And with the majority of the cash held internationally, should we be thinking of non-U.S. companies as likely targets?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, we will \u2013 obviously, we are constantly looking at the market, which capabilities are there, and we will \u2013 if we need that, we will acquire them wherever that is and where we will have a long-term return on that. So saying that, though, we did not see as today a significant opportunity on M&A, strategic opportunity we didn't see here yet. And look at our \u2013 you said digital, you look at our digital business. It's a best practice in the market. And obviously combining our digital with our capabilities and going to the market in 40 markets, you don't have other company who has been 40 outbound countries to connect in 200 countries.", "There are definitely other competitors. Are they in England, in UK, or are they here in the U.S. they do probably a good job, but they are not in our sides. And I think focusing on the operational excellence here and growing that part, it's probably more better for the shareholder value than looking for some additional thing then will won't fit in. But if there is an acquisition opportunity, which will upgrade our systems, upgrade our digital capabilities, we will definitely look at that and we are not shy to do that.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up on B2B operating margin, you called out higher technology expense as the driver of lower EBITDA margin. I'm just wondering if you could break that out for us. And maybe just give us some general commentary on how you're approaching that segment going forward. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. On the margins, we did have some higher technology expense and that's why you see the EBITDA margins ticking down from a year ago. There's not much more to break out than that. I think on a longer term basis, I think there's more potential for margin growth here in the B2B business, but we need revenue growth to be there at a follow-up level because the business has a higher proportion of fixed cost. So, as we get revenue growth, we should be able to drive better margins overall. And you can see the last few years, we've been able to improve margins in that business quite a bit. So, that is our expectation.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Andrew, I think there's one more person in the queue, so we'll take this as the last question.", "Operator", "Okay. And that last question will come from John Davis of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a bigger picture question on the margin. Trying to move past the timing this quarter and also the WU Way expenses this year, did you see a path back to a 20% GAAP margin? Maybe not in the 2018, but is that kind of what you are circling once you get back through all these one-time expenses and kind of right sizing, restructuring the business?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. John, I can't give you a forecast for next year, but if you just put the pieces together, we've talked about WU Way cost of $100 million being really the cost that we expect this year. We don't expect to breakout any separate WU Way cost next year. We have some other one-time type items like the legal accrual. So I think the margins over the last few years have been around 20% and there are a lot of factors that are going to impact margins. Currency is certainly a factor and currency rates are going to continue to move. Revenue growth is still the number one item for us in terms of impact to margin. So we need to see where revenue growth comes out.", "But with good revenue growth, we get more leverage on our cost structure, right which is 40% fixed. And the other cost items we talked about commissions and compliance have been more stable. So those are the different pieces and we need to see how all those come together. But again, some of the significant items like the WU Way expenses, we don't expect to break those out next year and really that goes away for next year.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just to as a follow-up, maybe touch on pricing for a second. Maybe you guys made some adjustments in 3Q last year to FX spreads. Is it safe to say that that's kind of run its course now and what's the outlook kind of heading into the back half of the year on pricing?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "We're stable. I don't \u2013 the last two years the 2015 and 2016, the pricing has been very stable, very competitive. We still have a premium about 15%, though the pricing pressure is not there. And I feel very stable on the pricing. The adjustment this quarter was also in the pricing grow-overs over the last year. So I feel very comfortable with our pricing forecast and also our competitive environment.", "John Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Hey thanks, everyone for joining us today and wish you a happy afternoon.

Please note this event is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Salop, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you. On today's call, Hikmet Ersek, Western Union's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Raj Agrawal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's 2017 third quarter results and then we will take your questions.", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in the supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements.

We are pleased with the third quarter results, including the continued success of our digital growth initiatives. Overall, we delivered 3% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter with solid profit margins and strong cash flow generation.", "Looking at the business segments, consumer money transport growth was led by digital as westernunion.com money transfer revenues increased 23% in the quarter. We continue to be a leader in digital with more than 40 Western Union markets that can deliver funds to over 200 countries and territories across the world.", "The third quarter results also demonstrate the geographic diversity of our business. C2C growth in the quarter was led by strong performance from Latin America outbound markets, such as Argentina, Brazil and Chile, which helped offset continued weakness in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and Africa.", "In our payments business, Business Solutions revenue improved to a slight increase in the quarter and our Argentina, Pago Facil and U.S. Speedpay bill payments businesses each delivered double-digit growth. Overall, we are on track with our constant-currency revenue growth expectations for the year, with reported growth slightly more favorable than expected due to strengthening of key foreign exchange rates.", "Turning to profitability, our adjusted operating margin was healthy 20.6% in the quarter. We also continued to use our strong cash flow generation to return significant funds to shareholders with over $700 million returned year-to-date through dividends and share repurchases.", "Now, due to favorable results and trends, we are pleased to raise both our adjusted and GAAP earnings per share outlook ranges for 2017, which Raj will discuss in more details in a few minutes. Strategically, we are focused on accelerating top-line growth over the coming years. Growth initiatives in consumer money transfer include further digital expansion and optimization of our retail business, primarily by improving the customer experience and increasing retention.", "Some recent progress points of these initiatives include the rollout of westernunion.com in Kuwait and agreement to preinstall Western Union's app on Wiko smartphones in France and further expansion of our account payout network.", "Initiatives in the payments-based businesses also include digitization efforts such as the EDGE platform in Business Solutions and the next generation platform for Speedpay. And we are putting more resources behind expanding our verticals business which focuses on specialized areas such as education payments and has consistently been our best performer within Business Solutions. We are also continuing to explore opportunities to leverage our unique global cross-border capabilities to drive more and new types of money movement through our platform.", "To fund and drive implementation of these growth initiatives, we have been focused on producing additional operating efficiencies. Our WU Way business transformation is an important part of these efforts. Although many benefits of the WU Way will take some time to realize, we are seeing good results from the initial implementations, especially we expect to achieve approximately $25 million of cost savings in 2017, increasing to a run rate of $50 million next year.", "The technology footprint consolidation and in-sourcing efforts are well underway as we consolidate 50 IT locations to a handful of key sites, and the implementation of lean management techniques in our regional operations centers, in Lithuania and Costa Rica, are delivering significant productivity improvements.", "Rolling out the WU Way across our organization and processes is a multi-year effort, but it's an important part of creating efficiencies to help drive long-term growth. And we are very encouraged by the first-year progress.", "So to summarize, our third quarter results were solid and we have increased our full-year earnings per share outlook. Our cash flows have allowed us to continue to execute significant dividend and share repurchase programs and we are advancing long-term efficiency and growth initiatives.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the third quarter results and our full-year outlook in more detail.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you, Hikmet. Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion increased 2% compared to the prior-year period or 3% on a constant-currency basis. The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $8 million (07:38) compared to the prior year. In the consumer-to-consumer segment revenues increased 1% on both the reported and constant-currency basis from the quarter. Transactions grew 2% led by strong growth in westernunion.com.", "Total C2C cross-border principal increased 4%, or 2% on a constant currency basis. Principal per transaction increased 1%, or was flat constant currency. The spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 1% with no impact from currency. Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1% in the quarter, while pricing was flat compared to the prior-year period.", "Turning to the regional results for the quarter, I will be referring to constant-currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the region's results. North America revenue increased 1% on a reported and constant-currency basis, while transactions grew 2%. Strong U.S. outbound growth driven by sends to Latin American and Caribbean countries was partially offset by a weaker trend in the U.S. domestic and U.S. to Mexico businesses.", "The U.S. domestic money transfer business originated at retail locations declined due to price reductions and softer transaction trends. Although, we continued to see good domestic growth from westernunion.com.", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 2%, or 1% on a constant-currency basis, while transactions increased 7%. Revenue growth was again led by France with mixed results from other countries across the region.", "In the Middle East, and Africa, South Asia region, revenue declined 8% in both reported and constant-currency terms while transactions were down 11%. The revenue decline improved relative to second quarter's rate, but we still experienced the impact of soft conditions in the oil-producing markets.", "Total inbound business to India was down approximately 10% in the quarter which improved sequentially from a revenue decline of about 15% last quarter. Weakness in the Middle East send markets continued to contribute to the decline. In the APAC region, revenue declined 1% or increased 1% constant currency while transactions were flat.", "In the Latin America and Caribbean region, Argentina and several other South American markets continued to drive very strong growth. Revenue increased 19% in the region or 22% constant currency on transaction growth of 17%.", "westernunion.com C2C revenue delivered strong results again in the quarter with revenue growing 23% on both a reported and constant currency basis driven by 24% transaction growth. westernunion.com represented 10% of total C2C revenue in the quarter.", "Business Solutions revenues grew 2% or 1% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of the XE.com business.", "Revenues benefited from good growth in key verticals such as universities and NGOs, but this was partially offset by continued declines in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in key markets. Other revenues increased 9% in the third quarter, or 13% on a constant currency basis.", "Other revenue growth was driven by Speedpay in the U.S. and the Pago Facil walk-in bill payments business in Argentina. The bill payments businesses represented over 85% of other revenues in the quarter and our Speedpay U.S. electronic bill payments business is the largest component.", "Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 19.3%, which compared to 20.2% in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin of 20.6% in the quarter compared to 21.7% in the prior year. The margin decline in the quarter was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and increased marketing spend.", "Adjusted metrics in the current quarter exclude $10 million of WU Way expenses and $8 million related to an accrual for estimated cost of an independent auditor which was required by our January joint settlement agreements with federal and state government.", "The prior-year quarter excludes $5 million of WU Way expenses and $15 million of accruals related to the joint settlement agreement. We achieved approximately $11 million of savings from the WU Way initiatives in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date savings totaled to $12 million. We now expect approximately $25 million of savings for the full year, up from our previous estimate of $20 million. Full year WU Way spending is expected to be closer to $95 million, down from the previous estimate of $100 million.", "Currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by approximately $9 million compared to the prior-year period. Foreign exchange hedges in the third quarter had a negative impact of $2 million due to the strengthening of the euro and other key currencies, which compared to a benefit of $12 million in the third quarter of 2016. For the full year, we now expect approximately $5 million in hedge benefits.", "Compliance expense was 3.5% of revenue in the third quarter. We now expect compliance expense for the full year to be closer to the low end of the 3.5% to 4% range in our outlook. EBITDA margin of 24% in the quarter compared to 25% in the prior-year period, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3% compared to 26.5% in the prior-year period with the decline attributable to the same factors as operating profit margins.", "The effective tax rate in the quarter was 1.5% compared to 9.6% in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted tax rate was 3.6%, which compared to 11.7% in the prior-year period. The tax rate in the quarter reflects discrete benefits related to statute of limitations expirations on certain reserved items. Our full year tax rate outlook has not changed, as we continue to expect full-year tax rate outlook has not changed, as we continue to expect the gap effective tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11% and the adjusted rate to be approximately 12% to 13%.", "GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 in the third quarter increased from $0.44 in the prior year period, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 increased from $0.47 in the third quarter of last year.", "The C2C margin was 23.5% compared to 25.1% in the prior-year period. The margin decrease was primarily due to higher incentive compensation-related expense and increased marketing spend.", "Business Solutions operating profit margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 4% in the prior-year period driven by operating expense efficiencies and lower depreciation and amortization which were partially offset by higher technology expense.", "Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior-year period. The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 19.7% which compared to 17.5% in the third quarter of 2016. Operating margins for the businesses included in other revenues was 10.5% in the quarter which compared to 10.1% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and technology efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher compensation-related spends and higher bank fees in U.S. electronic bill pay.", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $423 million year-to-date. This includes outflows of approximately $600 million from payments related to the settlement with federal and state governments and WU Way spending, net of associated tax benefit. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the third quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion in cash of $1 billion with approximately half of the cash held by United States entities.", "During the quarter, we issued $100 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 3.6% and $250 million of floating rate notes due in 2019. We returned $180 million to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $80 million in dividends and $100 million of share repurchases, which represented 5 million shares. The outstanding share count at quarter-end was 459 million shares and we had $956 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Based on our results and recent business trends, we are affirming the outlooks for operating margin and increasing our earnings per share and cash flow outlooks compared to our previous outlook reported on August 3.", "We are increasing our outlook for GAAP revenue slightly to reflect a more favorable exchange rate while the constant currency revenue outlook has not changed. We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be a low-single-digit increase, a slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase. Given favorable profitability trends, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, up from $1.70 to $1.80 previously.", "GAAP earnings per share, which has also been increased to a range of $1.50 to $1.60 compared to $1.46 to $1.56 in our previous outlook. Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.07 negative impact from foreign exchange compared to the prior year, down slightly from our previous projection of an $0.08 negative impact. We are increasing expected GAAP cash flow from operating activities to approximately $600 million primarily due to tax-related items, better-than-expected working capital changes and increased profitability. On the tax items, the approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the 2011 IRS agreement are no longer expected to be paid in 2017.", "In addition, this year's cash flow is benefiting from a tax refund related to prior-year overpayment and other lower than expected tax payments. Excluding the impacts of the settlement agreement payments and WU Way spending, expected operating cash flow for the full year would be approximately $1.2 billion.", "So to summarize, we are pleased with the solid business performance in the third quarter. We generated strong profitability and cash flow, continued to return significant funds to shareholders and increased our earnings per share outlook for the year.", "Operator, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you. Good afternoon to all of you guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hello. How are you?", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I'm well, I'm well. The margins were nicely ahead of our expectations and you're running, I guess, what 20.6% year-to-date, you're guiding to approximately 20%. So, I'm curious, why not raise the margin outlook for the year, should we expect a step-down in the fourth quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj. We are guiding to approximately 20%. So it could be a little bit above or around that range, it really depends on how the spending goes in the fourth quarter. We have planned for additional spend in marketing in other areas in the fourth quarter, so the margins are likely to be lower in the fourth quarter, but the overall margin for the year should be still quite solid.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "As you've seen.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Yeah. Got the approximate is the keyword.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yes.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, I'll ask on the WU Way savings there. I guess, you guys upped your savings a little bit and then actually reduced the expense of it by about the same amount. So is that \u2013 given how far along you are in that, is there more sort of upside here given what you've seen, what's driving the exact savings? Just trying to get better understanding what's structural versus maybe something just better than what you expected?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, Tien-Tsin, let me take that one. As you know, the WU Way initiative is a real lean management initiative which we implemented all over the company. The first results are very encouraging, it's better than we expected. I think the company started to operate in a different way, more much in a efficient way. And that is the one that's a reflection. Now, we are taking that, it's a multi-year shipment taking all over the company. And we expect $50 million of savings next year and this is encouraging and also operating in a different way.", "And what we are going to do, also taking the lean management tools really focusing on our growth initiatives also. We want to take that, it's not only cost savings, it's really to drive the growth stronger especially in the new initiatives and doing in a better way, that's something that we are very excited about.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Tien-Tsin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, thanks guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Darrin.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, Hikmet. Let's just start off, I mean, it looks like pricing and transaction trends are fairly stable again. If you could just touch on that in terms of sustainability along with what implications we have on the model around mix on the RPT, the per transaction revenue? And then just as part of that, the World Bank I know took up remittance flow estimates to, I think, the mid-single-digit range. So is that, do you find that the trends you're seeing now on the transaction trends now should even be more so \u2013 does it look more sustainable now in the context of what we're seeing from some of the outside estimates? Thanks.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I can take maybe that overview, big view, and Raj can go on the mix maybe, more mix side. Well, generally, I would say that we are satisfied with our transaction growth and with our business. And as you said, it's stable, we'd \u2013 also don't see a lot of price pressure there. There have always been as I mentioned, some corridors, we're going to adjust that, but generally the prices are very stable and we are comfortable with where we are with that and also with the transaction growth.", "The big help for Western Union is always being in 200 countries, and we are having a strong portfolio. We have strong geographic diversity, we have a very strong outbound Latin America outbound business, which recently really came out, U.S. outbound is still strong growth. We did see some softness in U.S. to U.S., but U.S. to Mexico maybe but it's not that big, so it's only of one quarter. I would say that the business generally is very stable and the diversity is very good. France is doing good, Europe is doing good. So these are good numbers, transaction-wise good.", "There are some mix, definitely \u2013 maybe, Raj, you want to add some comments?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. On the mix impact of about 1 point in the quarter that's something that we have been seeing for this year. It's really hard to predict exactly where that will be. And it really just depends on where we're getting the growth and obviously the growth is coming from lower RPT corridors and lower growth in higher RPT corridors and if you look at last year it was about the same and then, in 2015 it was flattish in terms of overall mix impact.", "And the World Bank data, they adjusted their principal growth for last year and our principal growth was in line with what the World Bank showed and then for this year, they expect something just under 4% principal growth. Our third quarter, we grew about 4% in principal, so we'll see where we end up for the year, but we're tracking in terms of at least the third quarter.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. So just also as you said, Darrin, in the last quarters, actually not only this quarter, has been quite stable the business. Our core business is extremely resilient and the growth is definitely coming from our new initiatives like the digitalization, like in also...", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right, that makes sense.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "... about 10% of our revenue.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, I know. That helps. I mean one of the things that you guys used to consistently call out pricing pressure as almost part of your annual guide of a couple of points and we \u2013 it just seems like we're in a different environment now and I wonder if there is something that's structurally changed in your view that's causing that. I mean just the stability has been pretty consistent?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I think remember the big pricing investment was 2012. So it was...", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "...many, many years ago and we did adjust our business, sort of reset our business there. I think we've been very stable and the other thing is also, it's a complex business, there is a complexity on that. I believe also the competitors and everybody understands that moving money cross-border, cross-currency is a complex business and we've been quite active in the early years investing in the compliance, investing in the technology and really adjusting, resetting our business; that helped a lot to have that consistency.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. In various countries.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Darrin, we have, as you know, we have thousands and thousands of corridors, so we're always moving pricing in many of those corridors, sometimes up, sometimes down, but on a macro basis, it doesn't translate too much in terms of net change.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "But individually, individual corridors we're moving pricing for sure.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up and I'll turn it back, is just on the, I think you guys mentioned you saw lower agent commissions \u2013 just if you can give us a little more color on that? I know that's gone back and forth through the years. But was that around negotiating at lower rates or is that a mix or can you just comment on that? And I guess, sustainability around that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I would say both of those things are benefiting us. We didn't call it out specifically this quarter, but we're continuing to see good performance from both the absolute commission rates that we're seeing in the business as well as the mix benefits from just faster growth of our digital business that's continued to drive overall commission rates down, if you will so, that trend is continuing. So it's a positive.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Darrin, I think it's a part of overall as I mentioned to Tien-Tsin before, it's a part of WU Way initiative overall, right, not only the commissions, but really how we operate more efficient in the market that lean the management helps also.", "Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. All right. Very helpful guys, thanks.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Darrin.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, guys. How you doing?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hello, Bryan.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Just wanted to ask on the third quarter results, did \u2013 was it ahead of your guys' internal expectations and maybe if it was, what exactly was a little bit better and surprised you guys?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I would say that certainly the tax rate was lower. We had originally expected a lower tax rate in Q4. So that's certainly in terms of timing that's shifted. And, we've continued to see favorable profit trends with the currency helping us a little bit and we're also getting some benefits from lower compliance spend. So those things are positive and that's really why we've taken up our overall outlook for the year.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And the $0.05 raise in the guidance, was that predominantly currency?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "No. I would say there was some profit impact. Some of it was currency, $0.01 of it was roughly currency. Overall currency impact is about $0.01 better this time in our outlook versus last time and the rest of it was just favorable trends overall. And you know as I said, I think those are the two components.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And then just on that lower compliance spend. Can you maybe talk, is that a trend in the marketplace, maybe you can talk about what you're seeing there and going forward, is it possible that number continues to track lower?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "No. I would say that, you know we're in the 3.5% to 4% range. Some of it is just timing more than anything else. But we're also trying to do things as efficiently as we can you know with technology and other solutions. So \u2013 you know we've been stable in that 3.5% to 4% range now for the last few years and you know so it's not \u2013 it's a relatively small range as you know, so that's we are still in that range.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "In general I would not see the compliance going away, in fact we do \u2013 we are invested constant in compliance programs.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yes.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Right, I mean that's going to be one of them, we see that as a competitive advantage and we did it in early years, Bryan don't forget that. I mean, that has been investment and I think we are continue to do. The thing is that we also put lean management tools there, and the efficient \u2013 we are running in a much more efficient way compliance and the team is doing a great job there.", "Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, no, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hello, Jason.", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Maybe just to start on. Hello, there. I wanted to start the question on westernunion.com. Obviously, the trends have been pretty healthy there, and I just wanted to get your general thoughts on how long can we sustain these kind of low or mid-20s kind of revenue growth rates in that channel. I mean, you're now up to 10% of C2C. The base is getting a little bigger, but obviously the opportunity set is still big globally. So, I mean, is this \u2013 do you see kind of multi-year runway for these rough kind of growth rates or...?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Well, obviously, I have not given long-term guidance on the growth rates, but I think we are very pleased with the beginning of a big journey here. I believe that the growth will continue to happen from digital. We are just in around 40-plus countries around the world with our online send apps, with our westernunion.com applications and sending money to 200 countries. And the competition have a hard time to go to the more countries because we have the regulatory environment, we have the compliance, we pay out in 131 currencies, we pay out in 500,000 locations or 3.5 billion accounts that can go forever.", "So, the growth rate is there and the team is expanding. We will like to be in 200 countries, sending money to 200 countries, that's our goal. Obviously, if we can send money via retail why not sending money only digital on 200 countries. So that's something we are focused on that. The growth is, as I said, it's just the beginning of a bigger picture.", "But the growth happening here from send site and we also started to do our account payout which is a big advantage. We are \u2013 in India, for instance, we have about 100,000 locations. We are not paying only on the location, but a big chunk of the transaction is going now on accounts. And we opened that, that's also a new customer segment. It's 80% of our customers still as new to westernunion.com so I am excited about that.", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just on the domestic money transfer business, I think you mentioned that there was some pricing pressure there. I mean was that in line with what you had anticipated or did something new happen in the quarter and when do we lap those pressures?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I didn't say the pricing pressure there. Our prices I believe in the U.S. domestic, we adjusted for a longer time and are quite competitive. And there are some price \u2013 some U.S. to U.S. softness, we see it currently, but I'm not sure it's the pricing pressure and we don't see significant price differences on the market there. Our transactions are below $200 and most of them are paid out in cash. But I think...", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "...the average is about $150 or something like that on the U.S. to U.S. only and paid out in cash and that's a big competitive advantage because we have 50,000 locations. You can send online, the sends are done mostly by online or by mobile app, but the payout is in cash. This combination between online and cash is a huge competitive advantage.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "And the dotcom business domestically continues to do very well and accelerated slightly actually in the quarter.", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's helpful. Raj, just one more quick one for you. If I look at the LACA region, the constant-currency revenue growth has been well ahead of transaction growth for at least the last couple of quarters. Any callouts there in terms of what's driving that, is that spread expected to continue?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "I don't have a forecast for the spread, but some of it is continuing from the larger price reductions we had made in Argentina more than a year ago. So some of that is continuing, but overall I would just say the Latin America business is getting healthy growth across the board. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the conditions are quite strong there. We've seen stronger growth throughout that region more than we've seen in some time. So it's good.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Maybe, Jason, just maybe use the opportunity, we are also now focused on the traditional inbound countries, which for years were inbound countries, also doing outbound from there. You can see like Argentina or Brazil or Turkey or Russia they've been now outbound countries and we are using also our digital way to force out funds (33:34) there. So you could see that we have different customers not only on the inbound now, growth comes also from new kind of outbound countries.", "Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Well, I appreciate all that. Thank you, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hey, good evening, gentlemen.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi. Hi, Kartik.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Kartik.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Oh, hi. Raj, you talked about increased marketing spend and I'm wondering is this more than you anticipated or is this more just a timing issue?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I'd say I think it's mostly timing, we had been messaging earlier in the year that we were under-spending in marketing. And so now that's catching up with us, so it's as expected from a couple of quarters ago. We're launching a number of different programs on the digital side to acquire customers. We're also trying to create awareness at some of our other digital capabilities of paying out into accounts. So it really is more timing than anything else.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And Hikmet, I know you talked about pricing, and as you look at your westernunion.com business, it seems like pricing is really stabilized there. Is there a reason for this, is that just less competition or are you in markets where you're not seeing as much competition. What's the primary driver there?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I think first of all, in the market, we feel comfortable that's for sure. We feel that's very competitive. I mean, don't forget our prices are still 15% to 20% higher in average from the competition overall in every trade. I mean, we do have a competitive advantage, trust, global network, speed, anti-money laundering activities, all these things add on to allow us to be a premium price.", "The other thing is also, Kartik, as you know the business, that's the beauty of being in so many corridors. We do portfolio management. In some corridors, we increase prices, some corridors we decrease prices. And we really are like a last-minute airliner, right, you fly on last minute, you want to pull up your feet. We really look at, we do street corner pricing, we do weekend pricing. So we are quite flexible there. And that gives us an overall almost flat pricing that has not changed over some, few quarters now.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "And then just one last question, Hikmet. Just your thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of competition as small and mid-sized money transfer companies they're having to deal with all these compliance costs? Are you seeing more consolidation? Are you seeing them, fewer of them or is it business as usual?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "I think there has been always competitors on some certain corridors. I think if you're a mid- and small-size company, you have difficulties to be a global company. That's where our big network effect comes. That's where our global trust comes. And on the small \u2013 there will be always competitors on certain corridors and we've been dealing in early years with our retail business and now it's on to more on the digital, but that don't forget 10% of our revenue is already westernunion.com. That's by far the largest digital business in the market.", "Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good afternoon. This is Jenny Dugan in for Andrew.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Jenny.", "Jennifer Dugan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. You mentioned in North America, there was some softness in pricing, just domestically within U.S. to U.S.; is that being impacted by the lower pricing in Walmart?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "We don't believe that's really impacting us much. Obviously, we have 50,000 locations here in the U.S.; Walmart has 4,000. Walmart, what they did most recently was they reduced an already low price. And so it really remains to be seen on whether an even lower price is going to bring in more traffic into those stores. So we feel very good about our positioning.", "If you look at our nation-wide pricing, it's pretty competitive to the other offerings and distribution is very strong as well. So that's not really the key driver and DMT in total for us is about 7% of our total revenues, just to put that in perspective. And again dotcom continues to grow really well from a DMT standpoint and we saw some accelerated growth there. So we're well-positioned competitively.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "On the 50,000 locations, Jenny, I would like to say that that's such a competitive advantage. You can send from mobile where you are now to 50,000 locations and we can pay out in minutes cash out. So that's a huge advantage that I think the competition doesn't have it.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And just quick follow-up, you mentioned that the tax rate in Q3 came in more similar to what you've been expecting for Q4. So is that just timing or are we going to see a lower rate in Q4 as well?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. It's just timing. We have not changed our full-year outlook on the tax rate. So still 10% to 11% or 12% to 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year, which is the same as we gave last time.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Jim.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Jim.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. I guess maybe on just a follow-up on the earlier questions on U.S. to U.S., it looks like transaction growth slowed down pretty notably in the quarter after having been pretty strong for quite some time. Can you help us unpack whether that's the entire market or potentially share issue and then maybe whether the hurricanes helped or hurt that in the quarter?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. Well, there are three pieces to the North American business that you're looking at. One is, U.S. outbound and U.S. outbound continued to grow really well. We saw strong trends similar to what we saw in the prior quarter and that's the largest piece. The U.S. domestic money transfer business, the retail part of the business did see some softness both in revenue which was driven by some of the price reductions we've made, but also some transaction softness.", "Some of it may be related to the hurricanes, but we'll see what that impact was as we get into the fourth quarter. It's hard to know exactly how much that was, but some of it may have been from the Hurricanes. And then the U.S. to Mexico is also part of that number and the transaction trends there were a little bit softer as well. The overall market seems to be a bit softer in Mexico, that seems to be more of the impact.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "That's helpful. Thanks. And then good to see the margin performance in the quarter, maybe just looking forward to the $50 million in savings, you talked about as part of WU Way, it's good to hear. But I think Hikmet, I also heard about some discussion around new product and technology investments. So, I'm just trying to understand, as we head into 2018, would you expect to drop the full $50 million to the bottom line or would that be partially offset by new investments and maybe give us a sense of what those might be on the margin for next year?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. I mean, we'll give a view of the margins and the other components of our outlook when we go into next year, Jim. But obviously we like the fact that we're getting more savings that's positive for us. Revenue growth is still going to be the number one driver for us in terms of where overall margins are because our cost structure is about 40% fixed.", "But we also want to look at some of the investment opportunities. Our goal is to try to accelerate revenue longer term, so we do want to put some of the money back into growth opportunities. Hikmet talked about digital expansion globally. We want to be 200 countries to 200 countries digital to digital in our wu.com business. So that requires investment. So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks Jim.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.

How are you both?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Good. How are you?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "I'm good. Thanks. I hope that didn't count as a question.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "No, I feel good.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "So, I wanted to ask about compliance. The compliance range, the difference between sort of the lower end of compliance and higher 3.5% to 4% about $30 million from my calculation is about $0.06 of EPS. It's pretty material, what drives differences in estimates as you go through the year with regards to whether you end up at the lower end of the range or upper end of the range.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Ashwin, first of all, we are pleased that we are targeting the lower end, right?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Definitely.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "That helped. That has been definitely great teamwork of the compliance department, IT department, and WU Way efficiencies, that has been the thing. But don't forget that this business is complex, it's in worldwide everywhere and one of the competitive advantages that we can manage that complexity and where others a little bit struggle I believe. And we always want to be proactive and invest in the compliance and that's something that I'm very focused on that the compliance and anti-money laundering programs have enough resources and really in efficient ways and I call it now also as investment. We invest for our future and that's why we are \u2013 keep it a little bit \u2013 still give it 3.5% to 4% because it's complex.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Ashwin, we came into this year expecting at the higher end because of some of the joint settlement agreements and the incremental activities, so the timing of some of those things have allowed us to be at the lower end. But we're continuing to invest as Hikmet said.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Right. But the joint settlement stuff happened like in 1Q, right, so I guess the question becomes you already have the settlements now.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "So going back to the previous question...", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "I mean, part of the reduction \u2013 sorry, Ashwin, part of the reason why we are at the lower end as you heard last time, we talked about the Southwest Border activities being completed early. And so that's something that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year. So that's one of the reasons and then other efficiencies.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Got it. And then no one ever asks you about your Business Solutions type of \u2013 but that profitability improved from 5% to 9%.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "It's just kind of like $0.01 of EPS, so what's driving that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "It helps. Just operating efficiencies, obviously we'd rather get stronger revenue growth, that's our number one priority. But we've also been managing the bottom line in that business, just in the environment that we're in. So it certainly helps. But our number one focus there is still to drive better top-line growth.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "Yeah. The next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I'm looking at the Middle East region and just trying to understand the sustainability of the trends there. You had a slight deterioration sequentially in transactions. But constant-currency revenue improved. So is there some pricing actions that you took in that market this quarter and just kind of how sustainable and the outlook for that region in general?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. There is probably some pricing that's helping us there. We expected that in the second half of this year, we would start to get some grow-over benefit. Key parts of the Middle East started to decline in the second half of last year and then as we go into the fourth quarter, India, the demonetization that began in India in November of last year should start to grow over.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Because India's strong corridors are from Saudi Arabia.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah. And the Middle East is a key sending region to India and so that should start to help some of the actual metrics in the Middle East and India. So you should start to see a little bit better grow-over impact from that as we go into the fourth quarter.", "Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Is Saudi Arabia to India still your third largest corridor?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "I don't know where it ranks, but it's still very important to \u2013 that's a very important corridor for us, Saudi to India. I don't know of its exact ranking, but clearly the top corridor for Saudi is to India.", "Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. And just last question on mobile, what percentage of your overall C2C transactions are originating through your mobile app today?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "About two-thirds of our transactions are initiating in our mobile app on wu.com. So if that was your question on wu.com, about two-thirds of our business is originating on a mobile app and it's even higher in the U.S. And so we're getting very strong growth and we don't have mobile everywhere yet. So that's really the goal is to be mobile....", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "And the reason why it's U.S. higher, Raj, is because we've been longer in the market with the U.S.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Takes some time and we are opening the new countries \u2013 and in some countries we go only by mobile in the country, which brings us huge competitive advantage. And it's really working very well with their own language, with their own apps, so that works pretty well.", "Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.", "Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, guys. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "All right, good. How are you?", "Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC", "I am good. Thanks. How are you?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Good.", "Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC", "Good. So, I mean, at this point, a lot of my questions have kind of been picked over, but I guess, can I can ask on, is the guidance here in Q4, the full-year guide on the top-line implies acceleration in Q4. Can you kind of speak a little bit about your confidence in that. I know you called out FX as a driver at least of the GAAP revenue acceleration, but is there anything else in there?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "I mean, it depends on the trends that we see in other parts of our business. We'll start to see some grow-over benefit as I just mentioned in certain parts of our consumer business. We've continued to see good strong trends in our digital business. And our bill payments businesses have been doing quite well, both Speedpay as well as Pago Facil. So those are really the key drivers of growth, both from a constant currency and a reported standpoint and then of course currency is helping us from a reported standpoint.", "Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And kind of related on the currencies here and maybe going out on a limb here, but do you ever \u2013 I'm talking the slowdown in North America and Europe sequentially. Do you ever see that the strength or weakness in any major currencies like the dollar or the euro plays a role in the fundamentals of your business?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "It can, it can. Over the long term, probably not, but in the short term, if there are extreme moves in currencies, then customers may change their behavior at times. When we saw the Indian rupee weaken some time ago or when we've seen the peso, we've seen a large influx of business into those markets. So currency moves in the short term can certainly have an impact on consumer behavior.", "Damian Wille - Jefferies LLC", "That's interesting. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Good evening.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Hi, Rayna.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "For 2018 and 2019, can you quantify the potential revenue and earnings impact from your recently expanded partnership with Mastercard to integrate Mastercard Send into your money transfer business. And secondly, is there any other partnerships or business you can do with Mastercard?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, the way we look at the Mastercard partnership and paying out here domestically, it's really just another channel to deliver our services. We have dotcom today originating transactions which largely pay out on retail, this gives us the opportunity to pay out to all debit cards in the United States, and including Mastercard debit card. So, we'll have to see, we don't really have any projections to give you on that, because we just, we expect it to launch early next year", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "But it's a exciting partnership, I have to say it's a exciting partnership, because it gives \u2013 really opens a new way of sending money and we are excited about the partnership as we mentioned in the press release.", "Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Hey, Drew, I u nI understand we have one more question in the queue, so this will be the final question.", "Operator", "Okay. The last question will be from John Davis of Stiefel. Please go ahead.", "John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to touch on WU Way expenses for a minute. I appreciate they're running ahead this year and that's good news. So $25 million run rate this year, $50 million by the end of next year. So I just want to make sure we're implying somewhere between $35 million and $40 million of realized savings next year. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "No, the realized savings this year will be $25 million and we'll have an incremental $25 million next year realized. So total realized savings next year of $50 million.", "John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And I think you said WU Way expenses will come down next year from the $95 million this year. I'm just trying to figure out, is the WU Way expense program margin-accretive next year meaning you're going to spend less than $50 million on WU Way expenses, or how should we think about that?", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Well, the $95 million of WU Way expenses that we're incurring this year will go away at the end of this year. So the programs themselves we may continue, but we're not going to have the spending next year, so it's zero.", "John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So all else equal there should be some margin accretion from the WU Way program next year.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Yeah, we've tried to call it out separately for GAAP margins and adjusted margins, just so you can see the difference that that's making.", "John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Then maybe just briefly on capital allocation, I don't think anyone's talked about M&A in a while, I mean I appreciate the commitment to dividends and buybacks. But how do you guys think about M&A, is it something you consider on a tuck-in basis or larger scale just as the industry changes, maybe some updated thoughts there on M&A?", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "First of all, yes, John, we do have a balanced capital generation. Thank God, we have a good cash flow. So, we have the luxury to look around and what is there. But we're going to be smart on our M&A activities. And obviously, we are looking on the technology site, is that something digital for the right return? And is there something other on the industry which will bring us an advance? But I think we're going to continue to be very smart on our capital allocation. And we have been very diligent when we look on our M&A activities.", "John Kimbrough Davis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Rajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.", "Thank you.", "Hikmet Ersek - The Western Union Co.", "Thanks, bye. Okay.", "Michael Alan Salop - The Western Union Co.", "Okay.

On today's call, we will discuss the company's 2017 fourth quarter results and the 2018 financial outlook and then we'll take you questions. ", "The slides that accompany this call and webcast can be found at westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations tab and will remain available after the call. Additional operational statistics have been provided in the supplemental tables with our press release.", "Today's call is being recorded, and our comments include forward-looking statements.

I am pleased with our fourth quarter results as revenue growth accelerated to 5% or 4% in constant currency terms driven by improved trends in our consumer money transfer business. Performance was laid by our digital business with westernunion.com money transfer revenues increasing 22% in the quarter and representing 10% of overall consumer to consumer revenues. ", "Recently, cents from Latin America and North America drove the consumer growth, but we also start to see improved performance from the oil producing countries of the Middle East and Africa. Our payment businesses were mixed with good double-digit growth again from our speed pay and WU Way bill payment businesses partially offset by poor performance from business solutions, which led to a goodwill impairment charge.", "Looking back on our full year, while 2017 GAAP net income was impacted by the Tax Act and goodwill impairment, our business remained resilient and performance overall was solid. We delivered 3% constant currency revenue growth approximately 20% margins on adjusted basis and adjusted earnings per share of the $1.18 exceeding our initial outlook at the beginning of last year. We successfully rolled out our WU Way business transformation achieving $25 million of savings and changing the way we work to enable operating efficiencies that can fuel future growth and we are able to generate strong cash flow and returned over $800 million to shareholders.", "We remained focused on leveraging our cross-border capabilities and reinvesting efficiencies to accelerate growth in the future. In addition to our distribution network and brand, we have a combination of key pillars that differentiate us and continues to put us in a strong position in cost quarter money movement. These pillars provide a strong and unique platform with advanced technology, compliance infrastructure, global licenses, regularity relationships and settlement and effects capabilities. This gives us over the opportunity process and drive more global funds and transactions to our platform by acquiring additional and incremental consumers, financial institutions and global businesses.", "In consumer money transfer, we believe digital will continue to be the growth driver and our resources are focused on digital expansion, more westernunion.com countries, more mobile, more digital partnerships and more products and services. At retail, we are continuing to invest in customer experience including providing digital services to retail customers such as stage and pay through mobile. We are also utilizing WU Way and lean processes to minimize customer pain points and optimize experiences to our money transfer business. ", "In business solutions and bill payments we are implementing new go to markets where they just continue to leverage our digital platforms maximizing digital self-service, making additional tech enhancements and driving operating efficiencies. We believe our unique platform also allows us to serve additional cross border payment opportunities. ", "Now as we look to 2018 our financial outlook reflects our expectations for a stable environment. We believe we will continue to drive good growth from our cross border, cross currency global business led by our digital channels although we do expect declines in our US domestic manufacture business. US domestic business which represents 7% of total company revenues in 2017 experienced softening transaction trends in the back half of the year and it\u2019s likely being affected to some degree by free P2P services in the market.", "The cross-border environment however remains stable and we again do not expect significant pricing moves this year. In 2017 we had the net price increases in C2C after flat average pricing the prior two years. We continue to expect good growth from our bill payment businesses. Overall in 2018 we expect low to mid-single digit revenue growth and approximately 20% operating margin with stable trends in pricing, commission rates and compliance spending. ", "So, to summarize we ended 2017 on a positive note with improved revenue trends in the fourth quarter and overall business performance for the year exceeded our expectations. We implemented the WU Way business transformation process and met our strategies to drive accelerated growth in the future. ", "We were again able to deliver strong capital allocation to our shareholders and we are very pleased to announce a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend. We feel good about our cross-border capabilities and strategies and look forward to continuing to execute against them to drive good results and future growth. ", "Now I will like to turn the call over to Raj to discuss the fourth quarter results and full year outlook for 2018 in more detail.", "Raj Agrawal", "Thank you Hikmet. As I review 2017 financial results I will focus primarily on the fourth quarter, the similar information for the full year can be found in our press release in attached financial schedules. ", "Fourth quarter reported revenues are $1.4 billion increased 5% compared to the prior year period or 4% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation net of the impact from hedges increased fourth quarter revenue by approximately $6 million compared to the prior year. In the consumer to consumer segment which represented 80% of company revenues in the quarter revenues also increased 5% on a reported basis or about 4% constant currency. Transactions grew 3% driven by growth in Westernunion.com. Total C2C cross border principal increased 6% or 4% on a constant currency basis, principal for transaction increased 3% and was flat constant currency.", "The spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 2% with a positive 1% impact from currency. Mix was neutral in the quarter while pricing had a positive impact of 1% compared to the prior year period. ", "Turning to the regional results for the quarter I will be referring to constant currency movement as I discuss individual country contributions to the regions results. North America revenue increased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis, while transactions grew 1%. In the quarter, strong growth in U.S. top-line business over the Latin American and Caribbean countries, India and Africa was partially offset by declines in the U.S. domestic and U.S. domestic businesses. ", "In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 6% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while growth was led by France. Transactions in the region increased 7%. Revenues trends in the Middle East Africa and South Asia region turned positive in the quarter, benefiting from improved results at oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia. Revenue in the region increased 1% on a reported basis or was flat constant currency, while transactions were down 2%. Total inbound business to India from all regions grew 7% in the quarter, an improvement after fourth quarters of declines following the government's demonetization program implemented in November of 2016. ", "The Latin America and Caribbean region continue to deliver strong revenue growth with an increase of 21% in the quarter or 23% constant currency, driven by Argentina and several other South American markets. Transactions grew 17%. ", "In the APAC region, revenue was flat on a reported and constant currency basis while transactions increased 3%. Westernunion.com continued its strong performance as reported in constant currency revenue of each grew 22% with transactions also increasing 22%. Westernunion.com represented 10% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Business solutions revenues declined 4% or 8% on a constant currency basis and represented 6% of company revenues in the quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by declines in sales of our hedging products and overall poor performance in Europe particularly in the UK, although we continue to see good growth in the education vertical. ", "Other revenues which consists primarily of our bill payments businesses increased 11% in the fourth quarter or 14% on a constant currency basis. Other revenue growth was driven by Speedpay, electronic bill payments in the U.S., and the Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina and represented 14% of total company revenues in the quarter. ", "Turning to margins and profitability. Our consolidated GAAP results reflects some significant special items so we have again provided adjusted metrics to better reflect the ongoing fundamentals of the business. The adjusted metrics exclude the impacts of the tax act, the non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to business solutions, move away business transformation expenses and certain federal and state government settlement expenses. I will mention the impact of these items in my remarks, but I refer you to our press release tables for a detailed listing of the adjustment items for the quarter and the year. ", "The non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to business solutions was $464 million pretax, the fair value revaluation resulted primarily from recent business solutions revenue and profit performance and the impact of the Tax Act. As a result of charge, GAAP operating profit and margin in the quarter were negative. Adjusted operating margin of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to incremental marketing spend and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by approximately $13 million compared to the prior year period. Foreign exchange hedges in the fourth quarter had a negative impact of $7 million due to the strengthening of the euro and other key currencies which compared to a benefit of $10 million in the year ago quarter. For the full year, hedge benefits were approximately $5 million compared to benefit of $48 million in 2016. ", "WU Way expenses were $35 million in the quarter and $94 million for the full year with about 90% of full year spending attributable to sovereign and consulting fees. We achieved approximately $13 million of savings from the WU Way initiative in the quarter which resulted in a total of $25 million of savings for the full year.", "Compliance expense was 3.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 3.6% for the full year. Excluding the previously mentioned adjustment items, EBITDA margin of 22.5% in the quarter compared to 24.5% in the prior-year period. Tax expense in the quarter included an estimated incremental expense of $828 million related to the U.S. Tax Act, the adjusted tax rate was 14% in the quarter compared to 7% in the prior-year period. The incremental Tax Act expense was primarily due to taxes from certain of the companies previously undistributed foreign earnings partially offset by benefits from the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax asset and liabilities and other tax balances.", "The company\u2019s 2017 U.S. Federal tax cash liability including the effects of the Tax Act and other company income and tax attributes is estimated at $780 million and will be payable over the next eight years with 8% per year payable in years one through five 15% in year six, 20% in year seven and 25% in year eight. Due to the complexity of uncertain interpretations of many aspects of the Tax Act, certain of the 2017 impacts have been provisionally estimated and additional effects maybe recorded in 2018 in accordance with SEC guidance.", "We currently expect our tax rate in 2018 to be between 15% and 16%. The Tax Act beat or based erosion provisions on U.S. payment made the foreign affiliate may result at a higher rate for us in 2019, but we are still evaluating interpretation as well as working on possible mitigating actions so it is difficult to project the precise impact at this stage. We will benefit from tax reform in relation to efficient, long-term access to our foreign cash as U.S. taxes on future foreign earnings will no longer be tied to repatriation. We do not expect the Tax Act to significantly impact our capital allocation plan in the next several years. ", "The incremental Tax Act expense and the goodwill impairment charge negatively impacted earnings per share in the fourth quarter resulting in a GAAP loss per share of $2.44 which compared to a loss of $0.73 in the prior year period. The prior year period was impacted by our joint settlement agreements with Federal and State government. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.41 in the quarter which compared to $0.47 in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Turning to the segment and other margins. The goodwill impairment and other adjustments are excluded from segment operating result. The CEC margin was 21.4% which compared to 22.8% in the prior year period. The margin decrease was due to increased marketing spending and the negative impact of foreign exchange partially offset by lower average commission rate and lower technology expense. Business solutions operating margin was negative 3.2% in the quarter compared to positive 9.7% in the prior year period. The decline was due to lower revenues in higher technology and other operating expenses. ", "Depreciation and amortization for business solutions as well as approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $12 million in the prior year period. The business solutions EBITDA margin was 8% which compared to 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. ", "Operating margin for the businesses including in other revenues was 7.8% in the quarter which compared to 6.6% in prior year period. The year over year margin improvement was driven by revenue growth which was partially offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange. ", "Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $736 million for the full year, this includes outflows of approximately $600 million from payments related to the settlement with federal and state government and $77 million of WU Way spending, partially offset by associated tax benefits. Capital expenditures were approximately $55 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter we had debt of $3 billion and cash of $838 million with approximately 25% of the cash held by US entity. ", "In December we retired $500 million of 2.875% maturing notes. We returned $92 million to shareholders in the quarter consisting of $80 million in dividends and $12 million of share repurchases which represented 611,000 shares. The outstanding share count at quarter end was 459 million shares and we had $943 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires December 31st 2019. ", "Turning to our outlook we expect solid business performance in 2018 with minimal net impact from foreign exchange and stable pricing. As a result, revenue growth is expected to be in the range of a low to mid-single digit increase this year both on a reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin is expected to remain at approximately 20% as we plan to reinvest in growth initiatives to accelerate the topline in future years. ", "We continue to expect to generate incremental savings of approximately $25 million from WU Way transformation initiatives this year which when combined with the 2017 savings would equate to a run rate of $50 million a year. As previously mentioned the effective tax rate in 2018 is estimated to be approximately 15 to 16% with the increase from last year's adjusted rate of 13% primarily due to discrete benefits recognized in 2017. We expect full year earnings per share in a range of a $1.78 to a $1.90. ", "Cash flow from operating activities is projected to be approximately $800 million in 2018 which is net of approximately $200 million of outflows from the combination of anticipated final tax payment, related to the IRS agreement from 2011 the New York Department of Financial Services settlement payment and WU Way payments related to 2017 expenses. ", "So, to summarize we are pleased with the solid business performance in the quarter. Delivery on our full year adjusted financial outlook and our strong cash flow generation and allocation to shareholders while we continue to implement our strategies to accelerate growth. We expect stable business and solid margins in 2018 and continue strong allocation to shareholders. ", "Operator we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan, please go ahead.", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Thank you so much, good afternoon it's good to see the acceleration in the C2C business so I'll ask just on the digital side I'm curious how are the margins performing for digital, I know its 10% of revenues now. And is the 20% growth sustainable in your view say in 2018?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Firstly, I am pleased with our performance overall. I would say especially as driven by the digital as you have mentioned. Last quarter 20% growth plus 20% growth, and we are quite -- we are only in 40 countries and the growth is still coming mainly from the countries which we've been longer existing and the new countries that are small not adding too much to the absolute numbers but growing very strong. And as you know we want to be in 200 countries with our westernunion.com delivering to 200 countries. So today we are sending money from 40 countries to 200 countries and that's going to expand obviously that's what's Khalid and the team all are doing very fast. And we are really picking the main corridors where we can compete and we can really grow strong. So, I am quite optimistic. ", "On margin side, I think that's truly good margin. Obviously, we are still in the investment mode. We are still in the marketing. Our main focus is in growth but we are very pleased also with the margin side and the .com side. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Okay good. And then I guess the only sort of wait maybe in C2C sounded like was domestic. I know you shared some numbers there, but how much of an impact did that have on C2C revenue and what's the outlook or maybe the strategy to turn that around?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah, I think as you know just putting things in perspective, there is only 7% of our C2C revenues is domestic. And domestic money transfer is still use cases, it's still immediate cash payouts at all locations, 50,000 locations. Also, you know send using mobile, sending cash payout or using cash to cash retail money transfer. We do see some impact mid-to-zero fee like Zell or Venmoon that part, we do see some impact on our business. And it's hard to compete with zero field. But we do have still use cases. People still using us to pay out immediate cash when they want cash it's a different customer than having B2B customers. ", "Raj Agrawal", "We saw some declines there, just to give you some metrics, it was 9% of C2C revenues in the last quarter. And a year ago it was 10% of C2C revenues so a little bit of a decline but it's manageable given the size that it is. ", "Tien-Tsin Huang", "Got you. And maybe just one last quick one just on the Wu Way front. Just curious do you expect that to have any revenue impact in 2018, 25 million incremental that was consistent but do you see any kind of revenue list potentially. ", "Raj Agrawal", "I mean the revenue list is going to be overtime obviously. We're investing now in various areas including digital, digital is where we would see more of the revenue lift in the short term. ", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think Raj, remember we'd all seen recent customer experience on the Wu Way. It's a different way of go to market with customer experience. The team has doing different things like our stage, and pay transaction at Walgreens locations. Or you really do a stage transaction on your mobile you go and pay cash. That's a good growth, because air transactions that's going pretty well. So, it's done by a Wu Way initiative. Really looking at them processes going with the lean management tools for the market. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Jason Kupferberg", "Thanks guys good afternoon. I wonder if you can just walk us through some of your segment level assumptions for revenue in 2018 between C to C, B to B and C to B. I know B to B obviously is having some challenges, I just want to make sure that we put the pieces right here.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah, I mean we\u2019re assuming similar to slightly improving trends in some of the areas obviously and that\u2019s why we have given a low to mid-single digit type of growth. Our consumer business overall grew 3% last year and on a constant currency basis that includes mid-20s type growth in digital so that\u2019s the kind of range that we would assume. ", "B to B we\u2019ve assumed better growth than we had last year. Last year, we were down by 3% in the B to B business so that should improve this year. We\u2019re driving a lot of activities to change the sales model in that business. ", "Our bill payments businesses had very strong growth last year and so that\u2019s something we\u2019re keenly focused on. That was driven by Speedpay and then obviously Pago Facil as well. And so those businesses do better than what we saw last year then we have the potential to be at the higher end of our range, but we have given a range of low to mid-single digits just accommodating. Obviously DMT we mentioned that we expect that to continue to decline this year and then we have done a little bit of pricing in U.S. to Mexico just on the FX spread site. So, we\u2019ll have to see some of those things play out.", "Hikmet Ersek", "In general, we expect both adjacent table pricing, I think we continue to see that from 2017.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay. Yeah. And maybe just on the strategic side. Can you walk us through your perspective on some of the block chain related initiatives obviously you guys are working with some companies in that space and just talk about how you see block chain getting integrated into your business and maybe give us a sense of what sort of timeframe over which that could happen and what some of the benefits could be?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Yeah Jason, obviously generally as a financial institution we do look at block chain in general and we\u2019ve been doing that for a some time, I would say and we are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization are also in the regulations part on the compliance part on the block chain capabilities and we do test, we do have some tests we dripple and we did that in some corridors also and the dripple is one example. We also have on the crypto currency, some investments on the digital currency group. And so, it is definitely some part of our innovation we are looking, but so far, it\u2019s not something to report that we\u2019re going to change the environment, our existing capability is very stable as you can see from our performance, but that\u2019s something that we are taking seriously and looking at it and testing.", "Jason Kupferberg", "Okay. And just last quick one from me. I heard you say $800 million in operating cash flow for 2018. I didn\u2019t hear the CapEx piece, which just trying to get through a free cash number and then what have you taken to the EPS guide for buybacks?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah, I mean $800 million is the GAAP operating cash flow estimate, that includes $200 million of outflows for very special items including the settlement with the IRS from 2011, more WU Way payments and then the settlement with the NYBFS or if you add those back in it\u2019s a couple of hundred million higher.", "CapEx I would expected to be in the same type of range that we have seen in the last few years 3% to 5% of revenues is where it's been, maybe towards the higher end of that range this year just given some real estate and other requirements we have.", "And then your last question was around share buyback. Share buyback, we have 940 million left on the authorization which is good for the next two years through 2019 and I would expect that we'll utilize most of that over the next two years assuming we don't have any other strategic things that we're looking at but that would be our base plan.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays, please go ahead.", "Darrin Peller", "Thanks guys. Just start pricing on the topline, the topline outlook obviously going for an acceleration and I know FX is part of that but we saw some benefit from pricing in the current quarter as you said. Just curious what -- you're saying [indiscernible] can you repeat an element of pricing benefit versus transaction growth through the business mix perhaps once again in '18. Is that helping you drive to maybe that mid-single digit number is that just currency, I'd be curious to hear a little more what's happening on the pricing environment first?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think we see the pricing environment stable and I think that as I mentioned several quarters earlier that the pricing environment has been stable because it\u2019s complex and it\u2019s some costs some operational expense to do this business to operate in 200 countries, so it is hard to -- our operation model reflects our pricing in the market, we are around an average 15% more pricy than the other competitors but has been stable. I don't see any changes here short term if nothing something big thing happens but I don't see the changes. ", "The other thing though is also I would say that we're going to continue to do pricing investment in certain corridors but overall the transaction trends has been also stable. It's not like only on the pricing side so the transaction has been also very stable and very strong growth on the dotcom side on the digital side.", "Darrin Peller", "Alright, that makes sense, but just one other question, when thinking about the margin profile and the outlook, again you're showing some acceleration too low to mid-single digit for revenues, you also have the benefit of now hopefully seeing some of the impact of the WU Way initiatives in terms of coming out, I know you adjusted out but essentially making the business more efficient. ", "I guess I'm just wondering in terms of margin expansion potential you're calling for I think 20% again, I guess I just wonder what you're planning on investing and what kind of growth rate and the topline you would actually need to get a more material amount of operating leverage in the business given the backdrop of acceleration.", "Raj Agrawal", "It\u2019s a very good question, we've given an outlook for low to mid-single digit revenue growth this year and ultimately the level of margin will depend on where the actual growth level comes out and we said approximately 20% so as we said before it could be above, it could be below that depending on where the revenue growth is. ", "We need sustainable mid-single digit growth at least to be able to get some leverage. We are investing back in the business this year, the most key area that we're investing is back in the digital expansion, we really want to be in 200 countries and territories as fast as we can and that's going to be over the next few years, so that takes time and money to get their channel expansion not just geographies but also more mobile, more accounts, those kinds of touchpoints. ", "And then we're also continuing to invest in our technology area in things like information security, privacy requirements, those kinds of things so that's where the investment is going, but we absolutely have the potential to drive better profitability in the business if we continue to get sustained growth at the mid-single digit level. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Brian King", "Yeah hi guys. Just wanted to make sure I had it correct on the stronger growth rate in the C2C in the money transfer business. I know it came in I guess 4% constant currency that's up quite a bit from 1% last quarter constant currency. Is that mostly due to economic improvement worldwide because even the digital business is about the same growth rate it's been in the past. So, I don't think that was a major driver. ", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah. There are two key areas that helped the growth improve from the last quarter. Middle East, Africa and South Asia, so the trends although they are still flattish, they improved dramatically from the third quarter. And we're getting the benefit of overall better performance in the oil markets, including Saudi Arabia which became positive in the quarter. And then India started to grow over from a year ago, the demonetization that happened. So that's a key driver. And then North America was slightly better as well given the strong U.S. dotcom business. So those are the two key drivers along with good growth overall in other parts of our business. ", "Brian King", "So, it sounds like that should be pretty sustainable as we go into 2018, now that those comps have gotten easier?", "Raj Agrawal", "I think from a comp standpoint, it will be good for the balance of the year, we would have to assume a stable environment in the oil markets. And so, assuming a stable environment it should be better. And then we're always looking at opportunities to drive more market share and other growth in our key markets. ", "Brian King", "Okay. And then the margins in the fourth quarter were below ours and I think street estimates. But it sounds like you guys were expecting to spend little extra on marketing. So, is that true it kind a came into align your expectations and for modeling purposes should we expect the fourth quarter this year to kind of match the lower margin that we saw in this quarter?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah. The fourth quarter of last year we spent almost 5% of our revenues on marketing it was 4.9% which is higher than it's been for some time. and it was largely timing from the first part of the year. and that's what we expect to do. We've got some 20% operating margins for the full year which is what we had expected. And that's about what we're guiding. It's hard for me to tell you what to think about the fourth quarter of this year which is really going to depend on how we rollout some of our programs. We'll give you more color as we have it as we move through the course of the year. ", "Brian King", "Okay, superb. And then last question for me. Hikmet, I know you talked about the U.S. domestic transaction is going to be a little bit weaker due to P2P services. What's the risk of that moves in to cross boarder P2P going forward?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think I don't see that risk high. I mean in certain quarters it could happen, but I don't see that risk high because we've been doing that cross border, cross currency you need to license this. You need definitely the compliance programs, you need the multi-currency settlement, all the platforms which differentiates us from others have been implemented, it's hard for duplicate, it's hard to rebuilt it. and that's what we are advancing and that's what we are really investing in. ", "And some companies which been doing this like competitors been only in the one country forever they couldn't expand their services to other corridors because it's hard. It's hard to go through a country and doing the services. It's hard to serve the customers in exotic currencies or minor currencies in minutes dropping money in minutes. So that's our competitive advantage, that's what we are building on, that platform and talking all the time. So, I think that it will be hard to have the P2P like zero fee, P2P into other countries.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar ", "So, a question on consumer behavior. Are you seeing any deviations from normal behavior due to changes in U.S. integration rules? So, for example our checks saw that the send to El Salvador kind of grows after diddling on the side of the TPS. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s one time in nature, you seen the same kind of thing particularly in your send on the U.S. to LatAm or Caribbean. And I guess the flip side of it is you see higher send amount, that\u2019s worth calling out as wages [indiscernible] and either things like that?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So, we don\u2019t see many -- I mean we operate obviously 40,000 corridors or whatever that is. We don\u2019t see many changes on the same side. If that\u2019s the question from customer behavior. Certain corridors there will be always some behavior changes depending on the regularity environment, depending on the pricing, depending on the product. But generally, I would say that we don\u2019t see it. ", "The second thing is also what we see Ashwin is on the digital side, the customers are still slogging in network. So, it\u2019s still incremental, 80% of the customers still the number has not changed. Are really new to our westernunion.com they didn\u2019t use at least the last 12 months our services and they are really new to our Western Union digital environment. That behavior is continuing. So, with our digital environment, we are getting new customer segment, with retail it\u2019s all about customer experience keeping the customers within our network. Is that an answer of your question?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Yeah. Now there is a follow-up question, I\u2019m going to line up the number to that question. The tax rate for 2018 I guess that\u2019s stayed hard. I guess looking ahead to calendar 2018 given that you lost your ability to use some of this cash management strategy, can you sustain this 15% to 16% tax rate that you have in 2018 into the future or should we be looking at that level?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah, just a little bit of back on this, 15% to 16% this year. If you look at U.S. tax reform where we will benefit from the lower U.S. corporate rate of 21% on income that is tax that U.S. rates are some part of income and then most of our foreign income will be tax now at the minimum 10.5% rate. So, the combination of those two things are giving us 15% to 16% rate this year.", "There is a third piece which is based erosion or beet [ph] which you may have heard about which this year is not much of an impact to us, next year it goes from 5% this year to 10% next year and that could have an impact of increasing the rate for us. ", "We think there are unintended consequences of this, it effectively creates double taxation for a portion of our income. So, we\u2019re looking for some kind of legislative solution to it that will help us and other companies or some kind of guidance and that we are also looking at structurally addressing that potentially this year. So that has the potential to raise the rate by a few points. Actually, we\u2019re not able to solve any of it but we're certainly working very hard this year to try to solve a portion or all of that.", "Operator", "The next question from Laura Foreman of Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.", "Laura Foreman", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions, I just wanted to go through some of the different corridors just in terms of -- to what end business the spends have been consistently strong and over 20% growth, is that something that you think you can continue in 2018.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well we're hopeful that it\u2019s going to continue. I think just look at it in terms of total C2C business. Latin America has been strong driven by Argentina and Brazil, Chile even Mexico LatAm has been doing opening up the smaller piece, so we've gotten the benefit of some of the market changes that have been taking place there, so we're hopeful that we can continue some good growth there. I don't know if it'll continue to be at the same level but we're still hopeful of some good growth in that market.", "Laura Foreman", "And then for US and Mexico it\u2019s the second quarter of continued weakness there, I think you mentioned some pricing changes. Can you give us any more color there?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah when the transaction growth actually improved in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter and our pricing from a fee standpoint has been quite competitive but we did review some FX spreads in the market for US to Mexico to try to grab some more share and so that's where really why you're seeing some revenue weakness there. Over the last two years we've done a really good job of gaining more share in that corridor with our 30,000 plus locations in Mexico, the ability to pay into the majority of accounts there so we're well positioned in the overall Mexico market I would say is also just softer given the environment that we're in.", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think over the years we've been capturing good market share there, but if you look at the last three-four-four years I think the team is doing a good job to grow this business.", "Laura Foreman", "Okay and then just one question on compliance, I don't think you gave any guidance for 2018 in terms of where it falls into long term range, any thoughts there?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah, with last year we ended up at around 3.6% of revenues for compliance as a percent of revenues, and this year we expect a similar range, we're not going to give the outlook any more on the compliance spend it\u2019s become more stable now. It is part of our normal business but I don't expect it to change materially this year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Daniel Hussein of Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.", "David Hussein", "Hi, thanks for taking the question, just to clarify the base erosion, is it as simple as five incremental percentage points to the tax rate to 21% for 2019 and then besides legislation were there other operational office [ph] that you think you might be able to implement, thanks.", "Raj Agrawal", "On base erosion I wish it were as simple as just adding the five points, it\u2019s complex, it\u2019s basically base erosion taxes, US payments to foreign affiliates so yes and there are complex formulas that you have to work through but it's worth a few points to us so it\u2019s absolutely a key focus for us to try to solve that internally and then the 15 to 16% rate for this year really takes into account all the other puts and takes and in tax reform it ends up not being a significant impact for us this year overall, but it is reflective of everything that we know other than the base erosion provisions that may impact us more next year. ", "David Hussein", "Okay, perfect. And then I apologize if you covered this. You didn't mention the hedge gains. So, were you expecting a meaningful margin impact from hedge losses this year that would potentially fall off in 2019?", "Raj Agrawal", "We had a negative impact from the hedges all year on the margin. And we don't expect the significant impact from currency overall. There is some impact from hedges, there is impact of stronger foreign currencies that helps to offset that. But when you net it all out there is not going to be a significant impact from currency in 2018. We are expecting a little bit of a loss on our hedges this year, just given where currency rates are, but that's more than offset by the strength in foreign currencies against the dollar on our overall revenues and profits. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. ", "James Friedman", "I wanted to ask you about -- I realize it's more of a journey than a destination, but with regard to India, does it still like return the corner there?", "Raj Agrawal", "You broke up at the last part, something about India?", "James Friedman", "Sorry. I was asking with regard to India. Does it feel like we turned the corner there at this point?", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well, India I think. India as you know many strong quarters India from U.S. to India, Europe to India and for Middle East to India. Definitely all projects in countries have been showing improvement including Saudi Arabia which is extremely strong quarter for India. And also, demonetization means that we are -- that's about last year quarter 4, and it's a grow over there. so that helps, and our business in India we are very pleased, and we also have a lot of India to account growing very strong. As you know we have over 100,000 locations in India plus we have millions of accounts in India which people are choosing now sending either to a location or an account. And we do see also a little bit better principle amount here, and using the online sending, dropping money on an account. So, the India performance has been very good for us. ", "James Friedman", "Okay. and I just want to follow up with regard to crypto. I heard your answer earlier taking it, but we get a lot of questions about that. If you could give us some sense of where we are in your perspective in the lifecycle of crypto applications in money transfer. I mean is it a technology looking for a business or do you see real use cases here? ", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well first, we have to differentiate between cryptocurrency and block chain obviously. And then block chain is definitely something interesting as an application, and which we may use it in several parts as I mentioned earlier is it a regulatory technology or digitally identifying or is it the settlement. And we with people do with ripple do some tests with some corridors on the settlement side. Is it dollar to pesos on that side, can we use that on a real time block chain environment. And so, this is the test we are on that. ", "On the crypto currency side, look, currency is currency. I think the big advantage we're seeing in globally is that we turn any currency to a use cases. So, we really turn on ordinary currencies so people really can use the currency to their day-to-day expenses or day-to-day use cases. ", "And if digital currencies are the ordinary currency which is used by a country then we could do it, but it is hard to do car wash with a bit coin or go buy a milk or pay school fees with a Bitcoin in Bangladesh or in Ghana or in Chile. So, I think that\u2019s the environment. And other thing is also look we are regulated environment that\u2019s one of our strongest asset that we are regulated in 200 countries and we response to regulated environment, we do have the compliance programs for 40,000 corridors and within that environment with the Reserve Bank together, we apply our operations to the regulatory environment. So, it\u2019s important for us that this currency should be regulated and so we can really serve the customers in the right way.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Rayna Kumar ", "It is good to see the strong growth in India. I\u2019m just wondering if you have seen any changes in competitive environment just given one of your largest competitors is making a big push in the region.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Well in India, I think generally it fits always where to send money from which corridor to where. The biggest advantage of Western Union is that we are in 200 countries with 500,000 locations plus with our 40 outbound, the online outbound countries. So, if you want you send the money with Western Union, it stays in the system. So, we can distribute to 100,000 locations and to our more than 600 million or 700 million accounts in India in minutes and that\u2019s the biggest advantage we have. We feel quite competitive in India. You can see from our recent report that our India business is doing well and definitely there are the competitors like Ria or MoneyGram are in the markets, but that has been the other markets also, big advantage we\u2019re seeing is that we are in many corridors and we are really in many portfolios and we serving the Indian customers.", "Rayna Kumar", "It\u2019s very helpful. Could you discuss your commission expense outlook for 2018?", "Hikmet Ersek", "I think commission has been quite stable, agents like us, we like the agents and the business works pretty well to prices and commissions which is very related to each other obviously has been very stable. If you look at that also over the years the commission rates have been declining. It helps also on our productivity and that is also part of that mix obviously mix corridors help us also to drive the commission rates down. But the agents have been very cooperative with us and that has been a good environment.", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah, the other thing the digital business growth that we\u2019re getting is helping the overall mix. There are multiple different mix impacts so as because we only pay commissions on one side of our transaction that\u2019s only helps the commissions. But then we also have to look at the overall distribution cost and minimize funding cost in the dotcom business. So, there are various mix impacts that are helping as well.", "Rayna Kumar", "Got it. I noticed your cross-border principle accelerated to 4% constant currency in the quarter. What were the drivers to that and is that sustainable this year?", "Raj Agrawal", "Yeah, I mean the improvement that we saw in some of key regions the Middle East, Africa, South Asian region, that's one of the key drivers of the improvement of principal growth, cross border principle and you know over the last couple of years you've seen our cross border principle has been somewhat negative due to that region's performance so now that we've had a little bit better performance that's also helping us from a cross border principle standpoint and this year the World Bank estimates for last year lease were for around 3.9% growth and we grew around 3% so we'll see the World Bank may continue to revise its outlook as it always does so we'll have to see what ultimately comes out.", "Hikmet Ersek", "The only thing I would like to add is that you know principle is good, also revenue growth is very important for us profitable revenue growth, so that has been very -- I'm very pleased with the performance of the teams there, and that\u2019s something they'll keep an eye also.", "Operator", "Yes please, the last question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair, please go ahead.", "Bob Napoli", "Thank you, appreciate it. The B2B business as you pointed out decelerated quite a bit in the fourth quarter down 3% for the year and I think you suggested -- you guys had suggested that it was going to be better than the down 3% in 2000 at least in your forecast in 2018, given the deceleration in the fourth quarter, what is going to turn that around quick enough to get back in the range of better than down 3.", "Hikmet Ersek", "Good question Bob, I think what we are trying to achieve here is definitely our sales approach getting new clients. New client acquisition has been a little bit slow in 2017. We do see good revenue growth on our payments part of the business but on the trading parts we have been very slow in hedge and forwards, that has been really declining that has been the challenge but on the payments side like university payments or NGO paid [ph] has been doing good performance and going to continue to do that and the focus is definitely on the forwards and hedges and turning that around that will help and acquire new customers that\u2019s something that the team is very focused, we put a new sales force and new sales approach there and that's something that the team is focused on that currently.", "Bob Napoli", "Okay thank you. The Speedpay business can you remind me what the size is of Speedpay? What is the growth rate of that business? What do you expect that to be over the next few years?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So, it's about 4%. It\u2019s about 400, little less than $400 million of the last year of our business and it\u2019s a good growth it\u2019s a good business we really like it and it has been a double-digit growth over the years and that has been a very good performance and so that's something that the billers like us also and customers use that that makes the payment very easy. It\u2019s a US business it\u2019s a domestic business and it\u2019s not cross border and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance.", "Bob Napoli", "Okay, and then last question. Your business I think has held up a lot better than many would have thought a few years ago, but as you look at your business today and get a little bit of an acceleration in the quarter what do you view, what do you keep an eye on as your biggest risks or competitors? Is it other blockchain players, cross border, is it things like Venmo or what is it is it Ria, is it just other companies in your space. What is the biggest competitive threat, especially since you still have that pretty substantial premium on the pricing side?", "Hikmet Ersek", "So that's a good question obviously. I'm thinking about that daily. So, one thing I realized also is that over the years certainly build something is really very competitive. But having this cross-order engine or platform with the regulatory compliance and technology advantage has been working and working and we are now what we are doing is that really taking that to the next stage with our WU Way and technology investments. We are taking that also to the next stage. ", "So, one thing is that we are going to the market with our WU branded products like we are now retail with Western Union and on our Westernunion.com with WU branded products. ", "The other thing is also we see good growth is that to white labeling of our platform to partners like financial institutions or big businesses. I think I got more and more calls from other businesses also from financial institutions, can you help us to deliver exotic currencies or minor currencies to certain countries or having also businesses delivering our platform doing the multi-currency settlement for many countries or also the compliance programs for many countries. That\u2019s something that I think coming here we are very focused on that, besides committed to our Western Union growth. This platform could be used also for some white labeling to extent our platform our new businesses and your financial institutions. ", "Michael Salop", "Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon.
